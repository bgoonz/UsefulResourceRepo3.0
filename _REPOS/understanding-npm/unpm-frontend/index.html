        <h1>Understanding npm</h1>

        <p>
          npm is the default package manager for Node.js. It was initially created to
          help developers manage dependencies for their JavaScript
          applications. Born as an open source project in 2009, npm features a package
          registry and client that enables developers to consume and distribute open source code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since its creation, the role of npm has expanded to fulfill the broader
          needs of the JavaScript and Node.js developer community to include
          management of front-end web applications, mobile applications and other
          JavaScript development tools and frameworks. Today, the npm project and
          registry is hosted and managed as a free service by npm, Inc, supporting
          more than a billion downloads a month.
        </p>

          This visualization is intended to help you understand the role and scope of
          npm.

        <h1>npm Registry</h1>
        <p>
          This is the npm registry. Every time you download a package using <code>npm install</code>,
          you're downloading it from here – it's essentially a huge database containing each package's
          files and associated metadata.

        <p>
          This is a package. Each package contains a little bit of JavaScript
          serving a particular purpose, and has useful metadata associated with
          it as well: its license type, a short description, GitHub repository,
          and so on.

        <p>
          npm's greatest strength, its size, is also its greatest weakness. There's
          too much code out there to conceivably digest on your own.
          However, there are a few quick checks you can make to narrow down the
          list of potential packages to use.

          Let's separate the packages that are missing a readme.
          A readme is the central point of documentation for any package published to
          npm, and is more or less essential if you’d like to learn how it works.

          And any packages that are missing a license field from their package.json.
          Unlicensed packages default to being copyrighted by the author, and as such
          are unusable in many commercial environments without permission.

          It's important that packages link to a git repository that holds their original
          source. Without that, it becomes more difficult to review the code and
          submit improvements.

          Finally, most packages need some kind of test script to survive changes submitted
          by the community. This won't always be the case, but can be a useful metric for
          a number of different kinds of packages.

        <p>
          There's a lot more insight yet to be gained from the registry, though.
          Lets take a look at the data in a more traditional format: the
          scatterplot.

      <section id="unpm-content-plots-02"><div class="content-body">
        <h1>Downloads and Activity</h1>
        <p>
          If we look at each package's weekly download count based on their last
          publish date, we can see that recently updated packages appear to be
          much more popular overall. It's also worth noting that the vast
          majority of packages are dwarfed in their usage by a select few.
        </p>
      </div></section>
      <section id="unpm-content-plots-03"><div class="content-body">
        <h1>Stars and Activity</h1>
        <p>
          We can see a similar pattern by plotting out a project's GitHub stars
          instead of downloads, although there is a wider margin between the
          majority and the most popular packages.

      <section id="unpm-content-plots-04"><div class="content-body">
        <h1>Invisible Utilities</h1>
        <p>
          If we compare downloads and stars together, there's little correlation between usage (downloads) and visibility (stars), implying that useful packages can be "invisible" utilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: <strong data-string="ignored-name">core-util-is</strong> is downloaded
          <strong data-stats="ignored-downloads">1,652,405</strong> times a week, but only has
          <strong data-stats="ignored-stars">39</strong> stars on GitHub. Conversely,
          <strong data-string="inflated-name">hover.css</strong> has
          <strong data-stats="inflated-stars">9,608</strong> stars but only
          <strong data-stats="inflated-downloads">30</strong> downloads per week.

          Let's break things up based on license choice and look at dependency
          counts over time. You'll notice that WTFPL projects tend to use fewer
          dependencies, and that ISC only became popular when it became npm's
          default license choice.
        </p>
      </div></section>
      <section id="unpm-content-licenses-03"><div class="content-body">
        <p>
          If we look at downloads on a logarithmic scale we
          can see that MIT packages are more popular overall, and GPL-type
          licenses are slightly less popular amongst users than other choices.

      <section id="unpm-content-prefixes-01"><div class="content-body">
        <p>
          Communities tend to share a package name prefix to identify themselves,
          for example <strong>grunt-contrib-watch</strong> and
          <strong>gulp-autoprefixer</strong> are Grunt and Gulp plugins
          respectively. Here we have our scatterplots grouped into npm's 48
          most used prefixes.

      <section id="unpm-content-prefixes-02"><div class="content-body">
        <p>
          You'll notice that <strong>react</strong> and <strong>ember</strong>
          packages use a lot of supporting tooling by the amount of development
          dependencies they use.
