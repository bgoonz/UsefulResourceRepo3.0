      Search a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
      Begin with an interval covering the whole list. If the value of the search
      key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the
      interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
      Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The binary search algorithm breaks the list down in half on every
      iteration, rather than sequentially combing through the list. On large
      lists, this method can be really useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n). The
      best-case time complexity would be O(1) when the central index would
      directly match the desired value. The worst-case scenario could be the
      values at either extremity of the list or values not in the list.
