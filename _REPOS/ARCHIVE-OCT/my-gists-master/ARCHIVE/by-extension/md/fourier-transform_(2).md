Total Parts Ticks Derive Running? <a href="" class="mrfourier"></a>

Enter frequencies (cycles/sec aka Hz) and see their time values, or vice-versa

-   Frequency input: `1 0 2:45` is 0Hz (size 1) + 1Hz (size 0) + 2Hz (size 2, phase-shifted 45-degrees)
-   Time input: `1 2 3` generates a wave that hits 1 2 3
