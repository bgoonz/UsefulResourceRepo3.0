    <p>I have a meticulously organized digital life.</p>
    <p>
      My computer‚Äôs file system allows me to track down any photo, video, or
      document I‚Äôve created during any month over the past 13 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Google Drive is similarly organized to keep track of documents such as
      the high school resume I used to get my first job or the documents I made
      for every single class during my 5 years of college.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, importantly for this post, I have a Chrome bookmark system that
      allowed me to stay organized and learn computer science/software
      engineering after a sudden change of direction in my last 2 years of
      college.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img

      />
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*RFARH8wUpI9y6RUv.gif" /></p>
    <p>
      Contained in these bookmark folders are links to hundreds of resources
      ranging from artificial intelligence to development tooling. This catalog
      of resources allowed me to organize my thinking as I learned new topics
      and to ultimately collect some incredible content that was instrumental to
      my learning during college.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as a recent graduate, I want to pass on some of those resources that
      were so helpful to me. My hope is that those in their own process of
      learning might find something useful in all of this just as I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      As hinted via the title above, this guide is focused on full-stack web
      development resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is due in part to an effort to limit the scope of this guide, but
      also because I‚Äôm really passionate about the internet and what it has to
      offer ‚Äî it‚Äôs quite a festive place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to simply providing an organized list of links, I‚Äôve included
      high-level explanations of each topic and how it fits into the world of
      full-stack web dev. I‚Äôve also included some of my own thoughts and
      personal recommendations (denoted by üî•) for some of the resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs my way of highlighting those resources which have been invaluable to
      me and an opportunity to give some plain-English insights/information that
      might be helpful to those learning about these topics.
    </p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>

    <p>
      I start this guide with development tools because even with all the
      knowledge of full-stack development in the world you need tooling to put
      it to action.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those new to the world of software tooling, it encompasses a huge
      variety of subtopics. Because of this, you can get lost down some pretty
      deep and overwhelming rabbit holes, but at it‚Äôs most basic it usually
      means
      <em
        >choosing a good text editor and terminal that is suited to the work
        you‚Äôll be doing.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Text editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are desktop
      applications, command-line applications, or web applications where you
      write code ‚Äî basically think Microsoft Word but specialized for writing
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*7ol8chUG8gaB-PRI.png?q=20" />
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*7ol8chUG8gaB-PRI.png" /></p>
    <p>
      There is an almost endless number of text editors and IDEs available that
      offer various benefits and drawbacks, so don‚Äôt be afraid to try out
      different options until you find something that feels comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current favorite is the very popular Visual Studio Code made by
      Microsoft (which is not to be confused with Microsoft‚Äôs IDE ‚Äî Visual
      Studio). VS Code is a flexible text editor with a huge number of settings
      and third-party extensions that can customize the editor‚Äôs look and
      functionality to fit and improve your workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to that, VS Code comes with some incredible built-in
      extensions for JavaScript and TypeScript that make it a very useful editor
      for web development.

      Terminals, sometimes casually referred to as ‚Äúcommand lines‚Äù or
      ‚Äúconsoles‚Äù, are desktop applications that allow you to interact with a
      shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shell is a <em>text-based user interface</em> that allows you to control
      your computer. Instead of using a mouse to click UI elements and icons,
      you type commands into the shell that allow you to do things like open
      desktop applications, run code, navigate your computer‚Äôs file system,
      automate tedious or repetitive tasks, and so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming proficient with a terminal/shell combo is a massively valuable
      skill in the world of not only full-stack development but of software
      engineering at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, just like text editors and IDEs, there are many terminals and
      shells with benefits and drawbacks. So once again have fun and try
      different options until you find something that works for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current terminal/shell combination is iTerm2 and zsh. iTerm2 is a great
      terminal with a rich set of features and customization options but is,
      unfortunately, macOS only. Zsh is the default shell for macOS.

      In the world of full-stack web development, the next thing to consider is
      browsers. These are the applications that allow you to access the internet
      and execute/render the frontend code (i.e.¬†websites) you will create.
    </p>
    <p>
      These browsers also offer tools for debugging and analyzing your website‚Äôs
      code. Learning how to work with these tools early on (and especially once
      you start learning JavaScript) is something I can‚Äôt recommend enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it is very important to know that the frontend code you write
      will not always work or look the same across different browsers (the
      reason for this can be better understood in the ‚ÄòHow Browsers Work‚Äô and
      ‚ÄòBrowser Engines‚Äô sections below). As a result, it‚Äôs highly recommended to
      have many of the
      <a href="https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php">popular browsers</a>
      downloaded so you can test your website on each browser.

      Understanding how to debug your code is one of the most important aspects
      of learning how to develop for a platform like the web. Browsers like
      Chrome and Firefox offer some absolutely incredible debugging and
      development tools. <strong>LEARN HOW TO USE THESE TOOLS.</strong>

      Understanding how browsers work under the hood will give context to the
      code you write and fundamentally change how you think about full-stack web
      development‚Ä¶ or at least it did for me üòÅ.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an admittedly advanced topic since there is a very different
      skillset at play when creating a web browser versus making a website, but
      I still think it‚Äôs worth reviewing at some point during your full-stack
      education and then continuing to revisit the topic as you learn more.

      Another really cool topic that is an even more focused look into how
      browsers work is learning about browser engines. This topic is not
      necessary to learn web development, but can once again be a nice way to
      gain a deeper insight into what is happening inside your browser. Also, be
      warned, this an advanced topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browser engines, in short, are the core pieces of software built into web
      browsers like Chrome and Firefox that do the work of executing and
      rendering the website code that you write. Typically, browser engines are
      comprised of two primary types of engines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rendering Engines ‚Äî Responsible for rendering the pixel-by-pixel layout
        of a website
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript Engines ‚Äî Responsible for interpreting/compiling and
        executing JS code (as well as WebAssembly code in some cases)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These engines are the primary reason that the frontend code you write may
      not work or look the same across browsers. Browsers will often use
      different engines that have unique implementation details which can cause
      differences in how a website is laid out or interpreted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >A Quick Note: It is also common for the term ‚Äúbrowser engine‚Äù to only
        refer to the part of a browser that is in charge of rendering a webpage.
        This is because it‚Äôs very common for JavaScript engines to be built in a
        way that they can function independently from a browser, whereas the
        rendering engine is a fundamental and baked in part of browsers. So keep
        that all in mind as you learn more about these engines in the wild.</em

      Client-side or frontend programming is the area of web development
      dedicated to creating everything a user of a website will see (i.e.¬†the
      UI).
    </p>
    <p>
      In its simplest form, all you need to make a website is HTML.
      Unfortunately, an HTML-only website will look and feel quite bland which
      is why CSS is also used to change the style of a website, and JavaScript
      is used to add more complex behavior to a website.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that point other languages, libraries, and tools like TypeScript or
      React are additives that make the job of creating and maintaining websites
      easier.

      There are many comprehensive web development guides available out there
      today but I‚Äôll take a moment to call out the
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"
        >Mozilla Developer Network</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few resources match the quality and robustness of the Mozilla
      Developer Network (MDN). It is a resource that is linked to many times in
      this guide and is probably one of the single most helpful resources I used
      to grapple with many of the web development topics I‚Äôve learned in the
      last two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs a website that I highly recommend you take the time to peruse and see
      what kind of content is available.

      As I stated above, HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) is the absolute
      baseline for what you need to make a website. It is the place where you
      include the content of your website and <em>define the structure</em> of
      your webpages.
    </p>
    <p>
      An analogy that I‚Äôm fond of is that if the content (i.e.¬†text, images,
      etc.) of your website is a pile of bones, then HTML is what you use to
      structure those bones into a skeleton (i.e.¬†a webpage).
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*JfAX8iLqbyl0oeFp.png" /></p>
    <p>
      You can use a thing called HTML tags to, for example, define a piece of
      text as being a paragraph or a title. Then by ordering these tags one
      after another you can define how all the pieces fit together.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some more comprehensive tutorials that cover all the major
      aspects of HTML. The HTML Dog resource is one that I‚Äôve found to be
      particularly helpful with its simple intuitive explanations.

      Tag Reference resources can be thought of as a sort of HTML tag
      dictionary. It‚Äôs a place where you can browse all the different tags that
      are available to use inside an HTML file with included explanations and
      examples of how to use them. Here are a few of my favorites.

      HTML attributes are special words that you can use inside an HTML tag to
      modify or define behaviors in those tags. For example, by using the
      ‚Äúclass‚Äù attribute in a tag you can associate some CSS styles with that
      tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      These references below are once again a sort of dictionary with
      definitions of all the attributes you can use in an HTML file.

      Character code references are another type of dictionary that defines all
      the possible characters you can use in an HTML document and their
      associated code that you type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say, for example, you wanted to include the division symbol on a webpage
      you can type ‚Äú√∑‚Äù and it will be converted into √∑.

      Meta tags are HTML tags that contain information about a particular
      webpage. These tags can define things such as the title or description of
      a webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, these meta tags can also define the information that is crucial
      for website SEO (search engine optimization). Below is a favorite resource
      of mine for automatically generating SEO related meta tags and also
      provides some great educational material if you scroll down below the

      Website accessibility is an incredibly important topic when making
      websites that can cater to all users. Accessibility can take many forms ‚Äî
      everything from blindness to having a broken arm to even having a slow
      internet connection. They all affect a user‚Äôs ability to access a website
      and its content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being able to design websites that accommodate the gamut of accessibility
      issues will not only lead to a better experience for those with
      disabilities but very often leads to great experiences for those without
      disabilities too.

      After HTML, the next thing you would typically use is CSS (Cascading Style
      Sheets). CSS gives you the ability to add style to an HTML file (read:
      make your website look festive and fancy).
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the same skeleton analogy from above, CSS would be like adding
      clothes to your HTML skeleton.

      ‚Äúselector‚Äù is, or what the difference between a ‚Äúrule set‚Äù and
      ‚Äúdeclaration block‚Äù is will make your process of learning CSS much easier.

      A massive concern when creating websites is the fact that it can be viewed
      on everything from a massive desktop screen to a tiny mobile phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Responsive design is the area of CSS and website design that is concerned
      with this issue. By using CSS Media Queries you can define how your
      website should look on those devices and change the styles of each element
      so that they look good on every screen size.

      CSS defines some incredibly powerful (yet simple) syntax for creating
      animations. With this syntax, you can create everything from simple
      transitions to complex multistep animations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are a couple of learning resources, as well as some tools and
      libraries that make the job of creating complex CSS animations a lot
      easier.

      As I hinted in the CSS introduction paragraphs above, the ability to
      define colors and also gradients is a power granted by CSS. Below are some

      palettes, accessible colors, and gradients when creating a website.

      With JavaScript comes the power to start creating truly complex and robust
      websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the skeleton analogy, JavaScript is what brings the skeleton to life
      (read: gives the webpage interactive behavior).
    </p>
    <p>

    <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*UUfaddiZpDBZujWx.png" /></p>
    <p>
      You can define behaviors like what happens when you click a button. You
      can dynamically create, manipulate, or delete elements on a webpage based
      on user interaction. You can make HTTP requests to get data from a server
      and so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays there seems to be an almost endless number of JavaScript
      tutorials out there. Below are my top picks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôll also take a moment to say that The Modern JavaScript Tutorial has
      consistently stood out as an absolutely incredible resource for gaining a
      comprehensive understanding of JavaScript.

      Understanding the DOM (Document Object Model) is one of the most important
      parts of learning client-side JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a high-level, the DOM is a representation (specifically a tree data
      structure) of every element on a webpage that browsers use to keep track
      of page changes and rendering. The reason we care about this is that
      browsers expose the ability to read and manipulate the DOM using
      JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how JavaScript has the power to dynamically create, manipulate, or
      delete elements on a webpage. The DOM is also the reason that single-page
      applications or UI libraries like React are possible.

      Events are another very important topic to understand when learning about
      client-side JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      They enable your website to have dynamic interactivity with a user. There
      are many events that you can set up your JavaScript to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù for such
      as a mouse click, keyboard input, or even if the user has access to the
      internet. When one of those events occurs you can define a piece of code
      that will be executed as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of listening for events and then executing code, as a
      result, enables some truly complex behavior in your websites.

      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) maintains a special importance in the
      world of web development because a majority of the data sent across the
      internet is formatted as JSON.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most modern programming languages have methods for writing/reading (often
      referred to as ‚Äúserializing/deserializing‚Äù) JSON which means that you can
      have a frontend website written in JavaScript sending data and
      communicating with backend server written in something like Go without any
      issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below you will find some links for learning more about JSON and its
      syntax.

      On the note of sending data and communicating with servers, AJAX
      (Asynchronous JavaScipt and XML) and Fetch are the way that JavaScript is
      able to communicate with servers by sending HTTP requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, Fetch offers a very clean way of requesting and receiving
      data from a server using promises.

      In short, promises and async/await allow JavaScript developers to do
      asynchronous programming. I‚Äôll let the resources below explain the benefit
      of asynchronous programming in more detail, but it‚Äôs basically a way of
      achieving faster programs using concurrency.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, a regular synchronous HTTP request will ‚Äúblock‚Äù your
      JavaScript from running other code until the results of that request are
      returned. However, by using promises/async/await your JavaScript can
      execute other code while it waits on the HTTP request to be returned. The
      ultimate result is that more code is run in the same amount of time when
      using promises and async/await.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, to be even more clear, promises are JavaScript‚Äôs way of
      handling asynchronous values, while async/await is a cleaner syntax for
      working with promises.

      Testing your code is a ridiculously important part of maintaining healthy
      codebases and projects. It forces you to think critically about the edge
      cases of your programs and also ensures that new features/updates don‚Äôt
      break something you‚Äôve previously implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testing frameworks make the job of testing your code much easier and
      streamlined and are well worth checking out.

      Fun fact, ‚ÄúECMAScript‚Äù is actually the official name of JavaScript. This
      is because the committee that defines the language specification of
      JavaScript is part of the European Computer Manufacturers Association
      (ECMA).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, the ECMA released a new specification for JavaScript that brought
      a ton of new features and improvements to the language. The name of this
      release was ‚ÄúECMAScript 2015,‚Äù but since it is considered the sixth
      version of the language to be released it is commonly referred to as
      simply ‚ÄúES6.‚Äù
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are a number of resources that cover those changes and improvements.

      Regular expressions (regex for short) are a way of performing complex
      pattern matching and are incredibly helpful for validating user input.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, you can use regex to ensure that a user has written a valid
      email address in a sign-up form.

      Moving on from JavaScript we start to enter the territory of languages,
      libraries, and tools that are not strictly necessary for creating frontend
      websites but sure do make the job of creating them easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such language is TypeScript. Created by Microsoft, TypeScript is a
      ‚Äúsuperset of JavaScript‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs JavaScript with extra features.
      Those extra features are namely a type system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of letting JavaScript determine what types of data (i.e.¬†numbers,
      strings, etc.) your variables contain or your functions return, you
      explicitly define the data types yourself like you would in a language
      such as Java or C.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefit of doing this is that you and larger teams can catch a ton of
      small mistakes that could lead to runtime errors. Accidentally passed a
      number into a function that should accept a string? No problem, TypeScript
      has got your back and will let you know.

      Another massive topic of frontend web development that is not strictly
      needed but is very often used these days is frontend JavaScript libraries
      and frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      These libraries and frameworks make the job of creating and maintaining
      complex user interfaces/websites much easier.

      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are the way that different
      pieces of software are able to interact with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the ‚ÄúWhat Is An API?‚Äù article below describes, an API is like a menu at
      a restaurant. When thinking of APIs from a client-side perspective you are
      the customer who is ordering food, while comparatively, when thinking of
      APIs from a server-side perspective you are the restaurant
      making/delivering the food.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a client/customer, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how the food is
      sourced or made. You simply just have to know the phone number of the
      restaurant, order a dish that‚Äôs on the menu, and it will be delivered to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Translated to the world of programming, it means you can request (read:
      order) data or resources such as
      <a href="https://dog.ceo/dog-api/">pictures of dogs</a> or
      <a href="https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api">horrible dad jokes</a> from an
      API (read: menu) that lives on a server (read: restaurant) somewhere on
      the internet ‚Äî it could even be your own server. When that data is
      delivered to your website you can then use it however you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      One final note is that client-side APIs can take three primary forms in
      web development: 1) Your Own API, 2) Third-Party APIs, and 3) Browser
      APIs.

    <p>
      Creating your own APIs is essentially what server-side development is/can
      be boiled down to. Thus resources and discussion on the topic can be found
      in the sections below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third-Party APIs are APIs created by someone else (usually a company). The
      relationship to those APIs is exactly as described above where you are the
      customer ordering data or resources that will be delivered to your
      website.

    <p>
      Browser APIs are a little bit different (and a little bit cooler in my
      opinion). The same customer-restaurant relationship can be used, but the
      restaurant location has changed. Rather than being located at some
      far-away server, the restaurant is the web browser itself (i.e.¬†Chrome or
      Firefox).
    </p>
    <p>
      This new type of restaurant also serves slightly different and slightly
      cooler menu items. There are browser APIs for using

      At the absolute cutting edge of frontend web technologies is one of my
      favorite topics to get lost in during the last year or so ‚Äî WebAssembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      WebAssembly is a low-level binary format/assembly-like language that runs
      in the browser ‚Äî in fact as of December 2019 it is
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en"
        >the 4th official language of the web</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      By writing programs in languages like C/C++, Rust, Go, and
      <a href="https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/"
        >others</a
      >
      that can compile to WebAssembly the internet could eventually be capable
      of running photo/video editing software, AAA video games, and
      <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/">much more</a> right
      inside a browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Note: Even though WebAssembly is the 4th official language of the web
        it is not supposed to be a language that will replace JavaScript but
        will rather work alongside it.</em

      During the last few years, Rust has positioned itself to be one of the
      primary languages to use for developing WebAssembly modules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some incredible tools and libraries have been created to support the
      Rust/WebAssembly ecosystem. There is even a WebAssembly working group that
      is actively working to make Rust‚Äôs support of WebAssembly even better.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a final note, a great place to start is the Rust and WebAssembly book
      that covers all the major aspects of Rust/WebAssembly development.

      For those who don‚Äôt want to go off and learn Rust, you can still take
      advantage of WebAssembly by using TypeScript! Kind of.
    </p>
    <p>
      AssemblyScript is a strict variant of TypeScript that can be used to write
      WebAssembly modules. It means you can use your knowledge of JavaScript to
      gain some of the powers of WebAssembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just like Rust, there is a great guide/documentation that covers how
      to get up and running.

      Even though WebAssembly is predominantly discussed in the context of the
      web it does not mean it is restricted to it. In the same way that
      JavaScript was able to move off the web with JavaScript runtimes like
      Node.js and Deno, so to can WebAssembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there is active and evolving development on two primary
      WebAssembly runtimes called Wasmtime and Wasmer.

      >
    </p>

      The goal is for this API to be standardized and designed to work
      independently of browsers and JavaScript.

        >In a sense, server-side programming could be described as the job of
        designing and implementing APIs.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated earlier, Application Programming Interfaces (<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjXBrJfp5TE"
        >APIs</a
      >) are the way that different pieces of software are able to interact with
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuing the earlier customer-restaurant analogy, as a restaurant you
      are exclusively preoccupied with taking customer orders, sourcing and
      making food, and delivering it back to the customer. Another really
      important component of this job is designing a menu (read: API) that is
      clear and best serves the customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Translated to the world of programming, it means at its core server-side
      programming is comprised of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accepting HTTP requests (read: accept orders)</li>
      <li>
        Processing the requests and finding/creating the data or resources that
        were requested (read: make the food)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sending the data/resources back to the client (read: deliver the order)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With all this being said, this analogy breaks down in a couple of ways
      because for starters a client does not always ask for data/resources to be
      returned to them. Rather, they might also make a request to add, update,
      or delete data stored on the server-side (such as adding a profile
      picture, updating a credit card number, or deleting a user account).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to that, the model I‚Äôve described above (that of getting,
      adding, updating, and deleting data/resources) is based on a form of
      internet communication called HTTP (more details below). HTTP is the
      predominant method of communication on the internet but it does not mean
      it‚Äôs the only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some great resources to get a better understanding of what
      server-side programming is and what it entails.

    <p>
      Thus far when describing how APIs work we‚Äôve focused on how the API is a
      menu that one piece of software can use to determine what another piece of
      software offers/provides.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we haven‚Äôt focused on is how these two pieces of software communicate
      with each other. To reference the analogy from client-side APIs, I said
      the frontend would use a phone number to call/message the restaurant to
      tell them its order. But this does not mean that calling/messaging is the
      only way to communicate with the restaurant ‚Äî the same holds true for the
      internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defacto way of communicating on the internet is HTTP/HTTPS (Hyper-Text
      Transfer Protocol [Secure]). Understanding this communication protocol and
      how to work with it is crucial for server-side development. In particular,
      learning about the meaning of HTTP functions like GET, POST, PUT, and
      DELETE will be very helpful as you dive into learning and using
      server-side languages/frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the majority of web development use cases, you only need to worry
      about HTTP, but as you continue your backend journey you‚Äôll discover other
      communication protocols like WebSockets, MQTT, SMTP, XMPP, and more.

      Testing and debugging your APIs is a critical part of the server-side
      development process and lucky for you (and I) there are some great tools
      created for doing just that.

      As I stated earlier the design of an API (read: menu) is also a critically
      important job as it can help the client (read: customer) be confident that
      they are requesting the correct data/resources/actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The predominant way of designing APIs in 2020 is to follow the REST
      pattern and is well worth learning.

      As the size and complexity of your server-side applications grow (as well
      as how many users your application has), how you organize or architect the
      various components will become a greater and greater concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020, a hugely popular architecture is that of microservices. The idea
      of microservices is to break up your server-side application into small
      connected logical units using technologies like Docker (resources can be
      found in the Cloud section) so that your application is easier to maintain
      and can scale to many more users.

      The next couple of sections will be dedicated to a handful of programming
      languages you can use on the server-side. Over time you will discover the
      same high-level ideas, goals, and strategies of server-side programming
      are generally used no matter what language and server-side framework you
      choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, picking a server-side language just comes down to a matter of
      the language/framework itself and what kinds of benefits and drawbacks
      they offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting off with what I think is a natural transition from frontend to
      backend programming is using JavaScript on the server!
    </p>
    <p>
      From its origins as a scripting language for Netscape Navigator (a very
      old web browser), JavaScript could only be interpreted and run in a
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when creating server-side programs you need code that can run on
      a computer (a server is essentially just a specialized computer for
      handling network requests). Lucky for you, there are pieces of software
      called JavaScript runtimes to do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
      These runtimes allow you to run JavaScript on a computer like a regular
      Java or Python program, while also giving extra functionality such as
      accessing a computer‚Äôs file system and responding to network requests ‚Äî
      creating the foundation for writing JavaScript that runs on a server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most famous and widely used JavaScript runtime is Node.js. However, a
      new runtime called Deno (created by the same person who invented Node.js)
      is also starting to pick up steam and capture attention.
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*3D_d0tGI-ycAFtC1.png" /></p>
    <p>
      As stated above, Node.js (also sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúNode‚Äù) is easily
      the most famous and widely used JavaScript runtime for executing JS code
      outside a browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are some great resources to get oriented with Node.js and dive
      deeper into its core topics. The Introduction to Node.js tutorials are one
      of the primary sources I used to learn Node and are well worth a read.

      Setting up a Node.js development environment is actually fairly
      straightforward since all the primary tools you need (i.e.¬†the Node.js
      runtime and the Node Package Manager) are both downloaded when you install
      Node.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other useful piece of a Node developer environment would be to
      use an IDE or a text editor extension for working with Node. My
      recommendation is to use VS Code as it already comes with an incredible
      JavaScript / TypeScript / Node extension built-in.

      ecosystem of third-party packages you can use (i.e.¬†pieces of Node
      software written by someone else that you can use in your own Node
      projects).
    </p>
    <p>
      A piece of software called the Node Package Manager (NPM) is installed
      when you install the Node.js runtime and is the mechanism for including
      and tracking the packages your Node projects use.

      There are many Node.js frameworks to choose from, but easily one of the
      most well known and well-used frameworks is Express.

      Deno is a new JavaScript runtime, created by the same person who made Node
      (Ryan Dahl). The runtime builds on the learning/takeaways Ryan had from
      building Node and as a result, includes some pretty great features when
      compared to Node.
    </p>
    <p>Some of these features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deno has much better security built into it</li>
      <li>It supports both JavaScript and TypeScript</li>
      <li>
        It has a pretty incredible set of built-in tools inspired by the Go
        language
      </li>
      <li>
        It has a high-quality audited standard library also inspired by the Go
        language
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a final note, don‚Äôt worry about needing to learn Deno right now in
      2020. Node is not going anywhere and will likely remain the dominant
      JavaScript runtime for many years to come. I‚Äôd rather suggest casual
      exploration when approaching Deno ‚Äî it has some seriously cool features
      that can be fun to play around with. Plus, if/when it reaches industry
      dominance you‚Äôll already be slightly ahead of everyone else üòâ.
    </p>
    <p>
      When diving into Deno I highly recommend watching Ryan Dahl‚Äôs talk on the
      10 things he regrets about Node.js. It gives some great insight and
      context for the goals and design choices of Deno.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that, the Deno Manual is a wonderfully written resource for getting
      started with Deno.

    <p>
      Deno takes a very different approach to package management compared to
      Node. Rather than using NPM to install and track dependencies, you import
      URLs pointing to the third-party modules you want to use right within any
      given JavaScript/TypeScript file you‚Äôre creating. When your code is
      executed, the modules located at the given URLs will be automatically
      fetched and installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em
        >Note: These modules are only downloaded and installed the first time
        your code is run. After that, the modules are cached (read: saved
        locally on your computer) so that the code can be re-executed many times
        without the worry of having to fetch and install the modules every
        single time ‚Äî which could take forever on slow networks.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Modules can be hosted anywhere on the web such as GitHub, a personal web
      server, or a CDN (content distribution network). Below are some links to
      Deno‚Äôs own third-party module hosting service and other popular CDNs where
      Deno modules can be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an additional aside, this way of approaching package management is once
      again a design decision inspired by the Go language and is, in my opinion,
      a very welcome and super clean solution.
    </p>

      <li><a href="https://jspm.org/">JSPM</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since Deno is such a new runtime the landscape of popular frameworks and
      libraries is still evolving. Oak seems to be gathering some popularity
      since it takes a lot of design inspiration from Express and could be worth
      checking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, I also left a link to the ‚ÄúModules‚Äù section of the
      Awesome Deno GitHub where you can find links to other web frameworks as
      well.

      For those who are not as familiar with Python, it is a very high-level
      general-purpose programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge goal of Python is readability and results in a language that can
      accomplish a lot with very little code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Node, Python also has a massive ecosystem of third-party modules.
      When combined with the fact that Python is a general-purpose language it
      means that you can write high-quality code for many areas of computer
      science such as data science, machine learning, scientific computing, IoT,
      and (importantly for this guide) web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official Python tutorial was my primary method of learning the syntax
      and ideas behind Python and is worth reading through (even if casually).
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that, I‚Äôve included some other great resources I‚Äôve used to pick up
      bits and pieces of Python info.

      One of the downsides of Python, in my opinion, is that setting up a
      development environment is not as trivial as one might hope. There are a
      lot of ways that a development environment can be set up and truth be told
      I‚Äôm not even completely confident in the one I have ‚Äî it‚Äôs still a work in
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said the resources below are some of the most helpful ones I‚Äôve
      come across for learning about the various ways that one can approach a
      Python development environment for web development.

      Another big downside of Python is its disjointed package management
      ecosystem. There are a lot of tools trying to solve the same problem with
      no community consensus on what is best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result, at least for me, has been a lot of reading, testing, and
      general uncertainty about what fits my workflow the best. My current
      favorite is called Poetry and is very similar to NPM.

      From my knowledge and experience, the two big web frameworks for Python
      are Flask and Django. Flask is a more lightweight framework that gives you
      the flexibility to implement whatever you might need but at the cost of
      writing more code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparatively, Django is a heavier framework that gives you a lot of
      prebuilt software for things such as user authentication. This means you
      can write less code but at the cost of less flexibility if you need to
      create something non-traditional or more customized to your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I‚Äôve only worked with Flask at this point, so those are the resources that
      will be linked below.

      Go is another general-purpose programming language that can be casually
      put in the same category as C/C++ and Rust.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not run quite as fast as
      <a
        href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/go-gpp.html"
        >C++</a

      or

        href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/go-rust.html"
        >Rust</a
      >
      (although it is still much faster than

      convenience, readability, and all the comforts of a modern language. For
      example, Go‚Äôs

      is easily the best I‚Äôve ever seen in a language and has led to an

    </p>
    <p>
      Along with some of its other
      <a href="https://go.dev/solutions/webdev/">features</a>, it makes Go an
      amazing language to work with for server-side development.

      During college, I took a class on server-side development that used Go as
      the primary language. The creator of the course (Dave Stearns) wrote a
      series of tutorials to parallel the curriculum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tutorials on Go are some of the most clearly written and informational
      readings I‚Äôve ever come across and were the primary mechanism that I used
      to learn the language. They are all worth reading.

      Setting up a development environment for Go is pretty straightforward. All
      you need is to download the language (and thus the command line tools for
      working with Go) and a Go language extension for your text editor of
      choice.

      As I hinted at in the Deno section above, Go has a pretty unique (and
      cool) way of approaching package management when compared to other
      languages like Node or Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of Go‚Äôs command-line tool that is installed with the language,
      there is a command called <code>go get</code> that can be used to download
      a package at a given URL. The package is installed locally to your
      computer and from there you can import it into any Go file you might be
      writing.

      </li>
      <li><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/">Search For Go Packages</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are some web frameworks out there for Go, but in most cases, the
      built-in packages mean you don‚Äôt need any third-party libraries for
      server-side development!

      Rust is a language I‚Äôm only starting to get familiar with but one that I‚Äôm
      pretty excited about. It is a low-level systems language that can be
      thought of as a C/C++ competitor with some very nice benefits and
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, it can run really fast (as fast as
      <a
        href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust.html"
        >C</a
      >/<a
        href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust-gpp.html"
        >C++</a
      >) while at the same time providing memory safety and an incredible(-y
      strict) compiler/type system that together can catch a ton of bugs and
      output very helpful/descriptive errors messages and hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the downside, Rust has some fairly complicated syntax and idioms
      compared to other languages, so it comes with a pretty steep learning
      curve. It‚Äôs definitely not a server-side language you should start out
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all that being said, Rust‚Äôs position sat squarely in the world of
      <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm">WebAssembly</a> and
      <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/networking">server-side</a> use
      cases that have caught my attention in a big way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to learning Rust you will find that the primary method of
      conferring information is through books. In fact, the official method for
      learning Rust is often called ‚ÄúThe Book‚Äù in the Rust community and it‚Äôs
      well worth reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a counter-part to the book that teaches Rust using a more
      hands-on example-based approach which I‚Äôve personally found very helpful.

      Rust has a fantastic package management ecosystem that is very similar to
      NPM. Rust provides a command-line tool called Cargo that operates very
      similar to NPMs command-line tool. Also instead of calling third-party
      code ‚Äúpackages‚Äù, the term ‚Äúcrates‚Äù is used.

      Similar to Deno, the ecosystem of Rust web frameworks seems to be evolving
      still. However, it is much further along than Deno with Rust being nearly
      5 years older.

      Continuing the customer-restaurant analogy, databases can be thought of as
      the fridge or cold room in a restaurant. It‚Äôs the place where food and
      ingredients (read: your application data) can be stored before they‚Äôre
      ready to be cooked and delivered to a customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as fridges come in many different shapes and sizes, there are a
      variety of database types that solve different problems. The link below is
      an amazing video that discusses the various database types you might use.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this guide (and my own limited knowledge of the entire
      database ecosystem), we will mainly focus on the most popular type of
      database ‚Äî <em>relational databases</em>. The most simple analogy I can
      think of is that relational databases are like spreadsheets that can be
      connected together. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) to create and
      maintain these spreadsheets. Below you will find resources for a popular
      dialect of SQL called MySQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, relational databases and SQL are so dominant that you will
      sometimes see non-relational database options casually referred to as
      ‚ÄúNoSQL databases.‚Äù That being said, I would once again highly recommend
      watching the video linked below to get a better understanding of what else
      is out there.

      MySQL is one of many flavors of SQL and just happens to be the version of
      SQL I learned. It can do all the core operations of any other SQL language
      but with minor syntax and feature differences.

      A big name in the NoSQL space that often comes up is MongoDB which uses
      JSON as it‚Äôs storage medium (compared to the spreadsheet-like format of
      SQL databases).

    <p>Finally, we get to the cloud.</p>
    <p>
      Physically speaking, the cloud is just a network of servers spread across
      the entire world that is owned and operated by a variety of companies
      (notably Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of full-stack software engineering, the benefit of the
      cloud is that you can rent the computing power and storage capacity of
      this network to run your web applications at any scale ‚Äî whether your app
      has tens of users or billions of users.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the big tasks of using the cloud is determining what services and
      technologies to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a mind-boggling number of these services available to use
      (Amazon‚Äôs AWS has over 150+ options alone). Notably, for web development,
      there are tons of options for web application deployment and options for
      database deployment. Some of these options lean towards automating the
      process of deployment while others are more flexible and let you use
      technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to set up your own custom
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take your time to research these various services along with there
      drawbacks and benefits and you‚Äôll be golden. Additionally, the first link
      below offers a great introduction to some of these services and what‚Äôs
      possible in the cloud.

      At a high-level (that leaves out a lot of details), Docker is a way of
      packaging your web applications into what are called ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù so that
      they can be deployed basically anywhere. This is very powerful because it
      means you as a developer don‚Äôt have to worry about getting your
      application to run on different servers with different operating systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kubernetes (sometimes called K8s for short) is essentially a piece of
      software for organizing and managing Docker containers in the Cloud.

      I hope you picked up some new knowledge along the way. Learning the many
      domains of full-stack web development can be a lot to grapple with at
      times but if you take your time and pace it out the results are more than
      worth the effort.
