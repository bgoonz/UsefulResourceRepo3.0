      <strong>Happy Numbers</strong> - A happy number is defined by the

      which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1
      are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.
      Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.

      <strong>Pig Latin</strong> - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on

      the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay
      is affixed (Ex.: “banana” would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more
      information on rules.

      <strong>Caesar cipher</strong> - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding
      and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the
      letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with
      the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2
      encrypts “HI” to “JK”, but key 20 encrypts “HI” to “BC”. This simple
      “monoalphabetic substitution cipher” provides almost no security, because
      an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis
      to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
