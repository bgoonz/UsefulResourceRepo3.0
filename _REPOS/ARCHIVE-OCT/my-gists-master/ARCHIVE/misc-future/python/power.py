"""
Given a value (a) and an exponent (b), compute the value of a^b

1. Understand
- What types of inputs can we expect?
    - Valid
        - Integer
    - Invalid
        - Decimal
        - String
        - Char

2. Plan
- Iterative or recursive approach?
    - First pass
        - Iterative
    - Second Pass
        - Recursive
        - Third Pass
        - Forth Pass?
