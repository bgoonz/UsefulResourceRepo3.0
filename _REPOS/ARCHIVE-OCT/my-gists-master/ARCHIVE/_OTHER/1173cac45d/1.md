Some things that are "better" with this `BetterPromise` implementation:

- `BetterPromise # then(..)` accepts a `BetterPromise` (or `Promise`) instance passed directly, instead of requiring a function to return it, so that the promise is linked into the chain.

  ```js
  var p = BetterPromise.resolve(42);

  var q = Promise.resolve(10);

  p.then(console.log).then(q).then(console.log);
  // 42
  // 10
  ```

- `BetterPromise # unthen(..)` / `BetterPromise # uncatch(..)` / `BetterPromise # unfinally(..)` allows you to unregister a fulfillment or rejection handler that you previously registered on a promise via `then(..)` or `catch(..)`, or unregister a resolution handler that you previously registered on a promise via `finally(..)`.

  **NOTE:** This seems to be the majority use-case for why many like/want "promise cancelation" -- IOW, often what you want is to just stop observing a promise's resolution, not actually forcibly cancel the operation is comes from.

  ```js
  var p = new BetterPromise(function (res) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      res(42);
    }, 100);
  });

  function f1(v) {
    console.log(`f1: ${v}`);
  }
  function f2(v) {
    console.log(`f2: ${v}`);
  }
  function f3() {
    console.log("finally!");
  }

  p.then(f1);
  p.then(f2);
  p.finally(f3);
  p.unthen(f1);
  p.unfinally(f3);
  // later
  // f2: 42
  ```

- `BetterPromise # finally(..)` is included ([assumed implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/finally) since it's already stage-4). Registers a resolution handler which is called on either fulfillment or rejection, sorta like if you did `then( fn, fn )` (but not exactly).

  ```js
  var p = BetterPromise.resolve(42);
  p.finally(function () {
    console.log("resolved!");
  }).then(function (v) {
    console.log(`still: ${v}`);
  });
  // resolved!
  // still: 42
  ```

- `BetterPromise # thenLog()` / `BetterPromise # catchLog()` inserts a step in a promise chain that simply prints the value to the console (`console.log` for fulfillment, `console.error` for rejection) and passes the value or rejection along to the next step untouched.

  ```js
  var p = BetterPromise.resolve(42);
  p.thenLog().then(function (v) {
    console.log(`still: ${v}`);
  });
  // 42
  // still: 42
  ```

- Instead of silently being swallowed, if a synchronous exception is thrown in a `BetterPromise` constructor _after_ the promise has already been synchronously _resolved_ (fulfillment or rejection), that exception overrides and causes the promise to be rejected with that exception.

  ```js
  var p = new BetterPromise(function (res) {
    res(42);
    throw 10;
  });

  p.then(
    function (v) {
      console.log(`then: ${v}`);
    },
    function (e) {
      console.log(`oops: ${e}`);
    }
  );
  // oops: 10
  ```

- `BetterPromise.try(..)` (static helper) is [implemented (so not just draft)](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-promise-try). Runs a function (with no arguments) synchronously, returns a promise for its return value (or adopts its promise), catches any synchronous exception and turns it into a rejection.

  ```js
  var p = BetterPromise.try(function () {
    undefined(42);
  });
  p.catch(console.log);
  // TypeError: undefined is not a function
  ```

- `BetterPromise.deferred(..)` (static helper) constructs an instance of the promise, but also extracts its `resolve(..)` and `reject(..)` capabilities, and returns all 3 in an object (aka, a "deferred").

  ```js
  var { pr, resolve, reject } = BetterPromise.deferred();

  pr.then(console.log);
  resolve(42);
  // 42
  ```

- `BetterPromise.lift(..)` (static helper) lifts an error-first, callback-last style function to be `BetterPromise` returning instead.

  ```js
  var readFile = BetterPromise.lift(fs.readFile);
  readFile("/path/to/file.txt").then(printContents);
  ```

- `BetterPromise.control(..)` (static helper) wraps a function so that when called, it first creates an `AbortController` instance, passes in its `signal` as the first argument to the original function, and returns a controller object that has both a `pr` for the function's completion, as well as a `cancel(..)` to send the abort signal. Ostensibly, the original function can then observe/respond to that passed-in signal and do something appropriate with it, like canceling its own behavior, passing it to `fetch(..)` to abort an Ajax call, etc.

  ```js
  async function main(signal,url) {
     signal.addEventListener("abort", .. );

     // ..

     var resp = await fetch(url, { signal });

     // ..
  }

  var fn = BetterPromise.control(main);
  var { pr, cancel } = fn("http://some.url");

  pr.then(..);

  // later
  cancel();  // sends cancelation signal into `fn(..)`
  ```
