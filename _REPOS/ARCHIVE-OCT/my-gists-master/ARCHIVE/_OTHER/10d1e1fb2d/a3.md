The results of the actual `csp.go(..)` example in the first snippet are confusing to me, especially the "ch2 closed" being repeated hundreds of times.

The results in asynquence's emulation example in the second snippet are more reasonably what I'd expect, as I set the timeouts up to alternate (via `% 2`) to get the channels alternating.

---

Without the timeout alternation, it would seem `ch2` should always win, and the messages from `ch3` would always be discared. Again, that's true in asynquence, but it's not really quite true in actual `csp.go(..)`.

Can you help clear up my confusion on expected "race" behavior (throwing away of messages, alternation, etc) for `alts(..)`?
