# Problem 8
# Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
# Hint:
# Ask for player plays (using input), compare them. Print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.
# Remember the rules:
# rock beats scissors
# scissors beats paper
# paper beats rock
