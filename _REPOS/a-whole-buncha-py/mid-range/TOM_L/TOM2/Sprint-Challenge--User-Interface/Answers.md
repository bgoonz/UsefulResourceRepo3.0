1. 
## What Semantic HTML is ##
semantic HTML is the use of the markup that reinforces the meaning of the content of your website. It is implemented via sematic elements such as ```<header>``` ```<nav>``` ```<section>``` ```<h1> - <h6>```  ```<img>``` etc; The use of semantic markup in HTML gives a more concise view of the world wide web. The semantic HTML lets search engine crawler (BOTS) and other automation see a clearer meaning of the site content. This can be adventageous for SEO and general indexing. But semantic HTML also helps make websites more accessible to people that need screen readers and other software to help them get around the website content and this then gives greater meaning to the content provided in the HTML pages. This in turn gives a better quality of life to the people viewing the pages that are visually impaired or have difficulty with colours etc; It also helps the internet hav more structure and creates a more standardised World Wide Web with greater meaning. 

## What Semantic HTML is NOT ##
Semantic HTML is not a markup that deals with presentation in that it is not a presentational markup. Semantic HTML will not make your website have different visual styles, that is the job of presentational markup in HTML and CSS such as ```div``` elements.

2. 
## Display: block; ##
```display: block;``` will set an element to be a block level element. This is an element that takes up the entire line and ends with a line break.

### Some block level elements include ###

* ```<p>```
* ```<h1> - <h6>```
* ```<ol> , <ul>```
* ```<div>```
* ```<form>```
* ```<address>```

### Some characteristics of block level elements include ###

* They can contain other block level  and inline elements
* By default they begin with a new line
* They create larger structures than inline elements

## Display: inline; ##
```display: inline;``` will set an element to be an inline element. This is an element that as  the name implies are elements that are inline with the html as in they do not break out of the block level elements and work in such a way that they seamingly are just a part of the text withing any given line. They are non line breaking with the exception of the ```<br>`` element which actually creates a new line.

### Some inline level elements include ###

* ``` <b> <big> <i> <small> <tt> ```
* ``` <abbr> <cite> <code> <script> <span> ```
* ``` <button> <input> <select> <label> ```
* ``` <a> <br> <img> <object> <strong> ```

### Some characteristics of inline level elements include ###

* They can contain data and other inline elements
* By default they do not begin on a new line
* They create shorter structures than block level elements.

the differences listed above are true for the default behaviour but as with most html this behaviour can be overridden in css. (Just bacause it can this does not mean that it should).
