# CSPT15_DS_ALGO_SEARCH_RECURSION_GP

*This is the GP code to start class with remember not to push changes to main*
# Your workflow
you should do several things

*NEVER PUSH TO MAIN*
- `Fork` this repo
- `Clone` your `fork` of this repo
- `Checkout` a new `branch` on your fork of this repo <firstName-lastName> *work solely on this branch*
- Take notes as you see fit and code along whenever you feel the need. (Put your notes in NOTES.md file in the concepts folder)
- Feel free to link in any assets or links to material that you find useful during your workflow
- pushing up to this will allow you to have a central source of data when working on the problems

Also remember if you want to share notes with others then you can request a merge to the initial repo to add your branch in to the communial repo and share your thoughts with others to better help each other go further in your learning.
