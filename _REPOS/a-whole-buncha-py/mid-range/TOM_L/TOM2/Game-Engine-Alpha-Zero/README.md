# Game Engine - Alpha Zero

This is a project derived from and inspired by the JavaScript Projects at LambdaSchool. They have been my motivation and inspiration to start making this project and I shall be usuing the things I learn at LambdaSchool to implement more features in to this engine as time goes by. I am currently in the process of learning JavaScript so please bear with me if there are any errors or ommisions in the code base as I go through this journey. all general comments and suggestions are welcome but be advised that this is a side project and shall be progressing slowly. This is being used as one of the methods of me learning and gaining a better understanding of the JavaScript language. and shall be an ongoing project with many refactors and remediations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project and test the examples when they are written, you can clone this repository to your local machine and open up the index.html file locally in your browser. If you do not want to clone the entire repository to your local machine feel free to preview it online at [website address TBA - work in progress]

### Prerequisites

You will need a computer with either Windows 7 or above / Mac OSX / or Linux to run this project. You will also need a web browser that supports JavaScript to view the html examples.
this project has been tested on windows in google chrome and edge browser so if you have either of those you are good to go. I am hoping that you do have a browser of some sort otherwise you may have trouble reading this on github.

### Installing

Here are the steps to getting a development environment up and running. [TBA] 
this will be filled in as the project is more mature. and when i have decided 
on a tool chain. as for now you can start contributing to this repo by forking 
it and cloning it to your local machine.

A step by step guide on how to get a development env running will be created 
as soon as I have decided on the actual dev environment. As it currently stands
my development workflow is using a docker image with linux ubuntu 18. 
nodejs, npm, less, installed from the ubuntu packages. And a shared folder 
with my local windows 10 machine where I use VSCode to do the editing of the 
code and run live server to test it under google chrome.
