		<p>Today, we are thrilled to announce <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror</a> as the new code editor on Replit for mobile devices. CodeMirror is a versatile code editor that has been specifically designed with mobile in mind, providing an excellent touchscreen experience. This change is the beginning of a focused effort on mobile development here at Replit; the editor is just the first step! The editor supports all the features you expect from a code editor, and we&#39;re working on making it even more powerful.</p>

		<p>Recently, I took it upon myself to both learn TypeScript and reverse engineer Amtrak&#39;s train tracking API. The result of this was the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/amtrak">Amtrak NPM Package</a> and my own <a href="https://api.amtrak.piemadd.com/">Amtrak Train Tracking API</a>. I wanted to make it easier for others to use the API, as the data received from <a href="https://maps.amtrak.com/services/MapDataService/trains/getTrainsData">Amtrak&#39;s endpoint</a> isn&#39;t useable without the use of decryption, and even then the resulting data is all in one massive JSON object.</p>

		<p>Earlier this year, we discovered that we were losing data for some of our users. This manifested as either repls being completely empty after reloading, or some of the changes to files not being present after reloading. Obviously losing data is the worst we can do, so we had to fix this immediately. This blog post narrates the adventure of how we discovered this, how we fixed it, and the lessons we learned during the way.</p>

What if you want to build some tool that will generate code, then execute it for your users? Or maybe you are building a specialized online IDE that injects code for users, then executes the bundle? With Replit, you can start building those kinds of applications quickly without having to focus on building a fast and secure backend. Build the frontend, we&#39;ll provide the compute power.</p>

		<p>Learning a new programming language can be a very difficult task. Where should you start? How do I improve my skills from &quot;Hello, World!&quot; to building complete applications? It helps to have a starter project. One of my favourites is building a web app. I have been learning the Nix package manager for a few weeks now - <a href="https://blog.replit.com/nix_dynamic_version">starting with creating a dynamic version system</a> - and I think its the perfect time to write a web application with it (Even though I probably shouldn&#39;t).</p>

		<p>Having <a href="https://blog.replit.com/quality">a solid foundation</a> is critical for us to be able to fulfill our mission of making programming more accessible, more creative, and more fun. We did a great job of making the platform more stable during last year, but every now and then we would still run into unforeseen problems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure">cascaded</a> into other parts of the platform, producing a bad experience for everyone. So back in October (just a few weeks after I joined the team) when we had 2 load-related site-wide outages within a week, we knew it was time to do a major overhaul of how our infrastructure handles traffic. And now today, we&#39;re announcing that as a side effect of that infrastructure change, <a href="https://replit.com/site/pricing">Hacker</a> repls now run in newer, more powerful machines, which means that we&#39;ll have more room to grow and experiment with more benefits for Hackers (and you might find that things feel a little bit snappier lately). This is the first of a three-part series of blogposts on how we rebuilt our infrastructure over the course of ~5 months.</p>

		<p>I have come to the end of my journey and have to say I am pleased with the outcome. My knowledge level before this experiment was literally zero. My husband even told me that code was hard and it would be difficult to produce an entire website in a short period of time. I will admit there were several times of head scratching and google searches galore. I also had several experts I could go to when CSS was confusing me. However, overall, I feel I gained knowledge on a subject that was, formerly, completely foreign to me. Ironically, an associate of mine reached out looking for someone who could assist her in solving an HTML code issue on her website. I was able to successfully help her fix the problem and explain to her some of the basics of code. I wouldn’t go so far as saying the former teacher turned student has become the teacher again, but this new skill set is already coming in handy. </p>

		<p>What do you think of when you hear the word “code” or when someone says they are “coding”? No, I am not talking about speaking in code, morse code, or family code words. So, what is coding anyways? Coding is just giving computers and other machines instructions on actions to perform. Coding is how humans communicate with machines, and it allows for the creation of websites, computer programs, and apps. Today’s job market is full of tech careers that require this skill. But what about the novice like me without engineering experience or the skill set to create something out of essentially nothing but digits?

		<p>We started Repl.it to break down what we thought of as needless barriers to start coding. Naturally, our first product was the repl -- a simple editor and console for evaluating code. Turns out that’s all our users needed to learn enough coding to make meaningful programs. From there, Repl.it started to grow incredibly fast among students, developers, and educators. As we watched what our most active users did with the platform, a pattern emerged around coding in the classroom: teachers would prepare a doc or a PDF with instructions and a base repl for their students to fork. Students then would open the PDF side-by-side with the repl and start coding. When finished, they would copy the link and email it back to their teachers. Finally, teachers would block off an afternoon to evaluate and give feedback on their students’ code. The process, while better than using a local IDE and passing around files, seemed tedious and we wanted to solve it -- that’s how <a href="https://repl.it/classroom">Repl.it Classroom</a> emerged.</p>

older cousin who was going to college for CS and getting code dictated to me

It seems like it would be intuitive, but it’s actually something sociologists have struggled with for hundreds of years. Is a community defined by a shared space? A language? A goal? Something as nebulous as just a feeling or an attitude? The answer changes dramatically depending on who you ask.</p>

		<p>At Repl.it our goal is to provide state of the art in developer tools to
everyone in the world, for free. When we started moving our product beyond a
simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and
wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every
editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our
development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach
our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our
frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and
warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades
-- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every
tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.</p>

when it first came out, I instantly fell
in love with it. The thing I liked the most about it was the component model. Until then
the JavaScript community has been trying for years to come up with the correct
abstraction for creating reusable modules, but it was always leaky. Because React
components are essentially functions, and because functions are the undisputed
champion of reusable code, it worked out extraordinarily well. You don&#39;t need
dependency-injection, or any other modularity hacks, you simply pass props! Also,
the virtual dom made it so that components are, by default,
protected from other components prying into their internals.</p>

quite a few ad-hoc hacks to glue everything together.  In this post, we&#39;ll go

To do so, we implemented teacher collaboration, which allows you to add an additional teacher to your Replit classrooms.
