My Favorite Hobby
-----------------
I Enjoy creating content for youtube. I really enjoy making explainer videos and making technical explinations. 
This makes for a good passtime as the rest of my time is spent out and on my feet looking after the kids etc;
I have a few channels. I have took a break from content creation to dedicate some time to Lambda so I shall
be resuming uploads at some point depending on content. I was thinking of remaking some of my old linux tutorials
and git tutorials to keep them up to date. I also need to remake my linux security videos as the audio on the old one
is not up to spec to say the least.
