      One of the coolest code editors available to programmers,
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs">Visual Studio Code</a>, is an
      open-source, extensible, light-weight editor available on all platforms.
      It’s these qualities that make Visual Studio Code from
      <a href="https://azure.com/python">Microsoft</a> very popular, and a great
      platform for Python development.
    </p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install Visual Studio Code</li>
      <li>Discover and install extensions that make Python development easy</li>
      <li>Write a simple Python application</li>
      <li>Learn how to run and debug existing Python programs in VS Code</li>

    <p>
      We assume you are familiar with Python development and already have some
      form of Python installed on your system (Python 2.7, Python 3.6/3.7,
      Anaconda, or others). Screenshots and demos for Ubuntu and Windows are
      provided. Because Visual Studio Code runs on all major platforms, you may
      see slightly different UI elements and may need to modify certain
      commands.

      In case you were wondering, Visual Studio Code (or VS Code for short)
      shares almost nothing other than a name with its larger Windows-based
      namesake,
      <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/python/"
        >Visual Studio</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code has built-in support for multiple languages and an
      extension model with a rich ecosystem of support for others. VS Code is
      updated monthly, and you can keep up to date at the
      <a href="http://aka.ms/pythonblog">Microsoft Python blog</a>. Microsoft
      even makes the
      <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode">VS Code GitHub repo</a>

    <p>
      Discovering and installing new extensions and themes is accessible by
      clicking on the <em>Extensions</em> icon on the Activity Bar. You can
      search for extensions using keywords, sort the results numerous ways, and
      install extensions quickly and easily. For this article, install the
      Python extension by typing <code>python</code> in the
      <em>Extensions</em> item on the Activity Bar, and clicking
      <em>Install</em>:

      One important thing to mention is that Visual Studio Code is highly
      configurable through
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings"
        >user and workspace settings</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      User settings are global across all Visual Studio Code instances, while
      workspace settings are local to the specific folder or project workspace.
      Workspace settings give VS Code tons of flexibility, and I call out
      workspace settings throughout this article. Workspace settings are stored
      as <code>.json</code> files in a folder local to the project workspace
      called <code>.vscode</code>.

    <p>
      Let’s start our exploration of Python development in Visual Studio Code
      with a new Python program. In VS Code, type Ctrl+N to open a new File.
      (You can also select <em>File, New</em> from the menu.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The Visual Studio Code UI provides the
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette"
        >Command Palette</a
      >, from which you can search and execute any command without leaving the
      keyboard. Open the Command Palette using Ctrl+Shift+P, type
      <code>File: New File</code>, and hit Enter to open a new file.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how you get there, you should see a VS Code window that looks
      similar to the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-new-file.39cc7b9e485d.png"

          alt="Creating a new file in VSCode"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>Once a new file is opened, you can begin entering code.</p>
    <h3 id="entering-python-code">
      Entering Python Code<a
        href="#entering-python-code"
        title="Permanent link"
      ></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      For our test code, let’s quickly code up the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes"
        >Sieve of Eratosthenes</a
      >
      (which finds all primes less than a given number). Begin typing the
      following code in the new tab you just opened:
    </p>
    <p><code>sieve = [True] * 101 for i in range(2, 100):</code></p>
    <p>You should see something similar to this:</p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-unformatted-code.e11b194803fe.png"
        ><img
          src="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-unformatted-code.e11b194803fe.png"
          alt="Unformatted code in VSCode"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait, what’s going on? Why isn’t Visual Studio Code doing any keyword
      highlighting, any auto-formatting, or anything really helpful? What gives?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is that, right now, VS Code doesn’t know what kind of file it’s
      dealing with. The buffer is called <code>Untitled-1</code>, and if you
      look in the lower right corner of the window, you’ll see the words
      <em>Plain Text</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To activate the Python extension, save the file (by selecting
      <em>File, Save</em> from the menu, <em>File:Save File</em> from the
      Command Palette, or just using Ctrl+S) as <code>sieve.py</code>. VS Code
      will see the <code>.py</code> extension and correctly interpret the file
      as Python code. Now your window should look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-formatted-code.312b8d79fbe7.png"
        ><img
          src="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-formatted-code.312b8d79fbe7.png"
          alt="Properly formatted Python code in VSCode"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s much better! VS Code automatically reformats the file as Python,
      which you can verify by inspecting the language mode in the lower left
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have multiple Python installations (like Python 2.7, Python 3.x, or
      Anaconda), you can change which Python interpreter VS Code uses by
      clicking the language mode indicator, or selecting
      <em>Python: Select Interpreter</em> from the Command Palette. VS Code
      supports
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatterspecific-settings"
        >formatting</a
      >
      using <code>pep8</code> by default, but you can select
      <code>black</code> or <code>yapf</code> if you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s add the rest of the Sieve code now. To see IntelliSense at work,
      type this code directly rather than cut and paste, and you should see
      something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://files.realpython.com/media/typing-sieve-code.3d2ea083d917.gif"
        ><img
          src="https://files.realpython.com/media/typing-sieve-code.3d2ea083d917.gif"
          alt="Typing the Sieve of Eratosthenes Python code"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>Here’s the full code for a basic Sieve of Eratosthenes:</p>
    <p>
      <code
        >sieve = [True] * 101 for i in range(2, 100): if sieve[i]: print(i) for
        j in range(i*i, 100, i): sieve[j] = False</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      As you type this code, VS Code automatically indents the lines under
      <code>for</code> and <code>if</code> statements for you properly, adds
      closing parentheses, and makes suggestions for you. That’s the power of
      IntelliSense working for you.

      Running Python Code<a
        href="#running-python-code"
        title="Permanent link"
      ></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that the code is complete, you can run it. There is no need to leave
      the editor to do this: Visual Studio Code can run this program directly in
      the editor. Save the file (using Ctrl+S), then right-click in the editor
      window and select <em>Run Python File in Terminal</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
      You should see the Terminal pane appear at the bottom of the window, with
      your code output showing.

    </h3>
    <p>
      You may have seen a pop up appear while you were typing, stating that
      linting was not available. You can quickly install linting support from
      that pop up, which defaults to
      <a
        href="https://realpython.com/courses/writing-cleaner-python-code-pylint/"
        >PyLint</a
      >. VS Code also supports other linters. Here’s the complete list at the
      time of this writing:

      <li><code>pylint</code></li>
      <li><code>flake8</code></li>

      >
      has complete details on how to setup each linter.
    </p>
    <p>

      In the Sieve of Eratosthenes example, you created a single Python file.
      That’s great as an example, but many times, you’ll create larger projects
      and work on them over a longer period of time. A typical new project work
      flow might look like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a folder to hold the project (which may include a new GitHub
        project)
      </li>
      <li>Change to the new folder</li>
      <li>
        Create the initial Python code using the command
        <code>code filename.py</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using Visual Studio Code on a Python project (as opposed to a single
      Python file) opens up tons more functionality that lets VS Code truly
      shine. Let’s take a look at how it works with a larger project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the previous millennium, when I was a much younger programmer, I
      wrote a calculator program that parsed equations written in infix
      notation, using an adaptation of Edsger Dijkstra’s
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm"
        >shunting yard algorithm</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To demonstrate the project-focused features of Visual Studio Code, I began
      recreating the shunting yard algorithm as an
      <a href="https://github.com/JFincher42/PyEval"
        >equation evaluation library</a
      >
      in Python. To continue following along, feel free to clone the repo
      locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the folder is created locally, you can open the entire folder in VS
      Code quickly. My preferred method (as mentioned above) is modified as
      follows, since I already have the folder and basic files created:
    </p>
    <p><code>cd /path/to/project code .</code></p>
    <p>
      VS Code understands, and will use, any
      <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>,
      <a href="https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pipenv</a>, or
      <a href="https://conda.io/docs/">conda</a> environments it sees when
      opened this way. You don’t even need to start the virtual environment
      first! You can even open a folder from the UI, using
      <em>File, Open Folder</em> from the menu, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+O from the
      keyboard, or <em>File:Open Folder</em> from the Command Palette.
    </p>
    <p>For my equation eval library project, here’s what I see:</p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-pyeval-library-folder.964b91919d5b.png"
        ><img

          alt="PyEval folder open in VSCode"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Visual Studio Code opens the folder, it also opens the files you last
      had opened. (This is configurable.) You can open, edit, run, and debug any
      file listed. The Explorer view in the Activity Bar on the left gives you a
      view of all the files in the folder and shows how many unsaved files exist
      in the current set of tabs.
    </p>
    <h2 id="testing-support">
      Testing Support<a href="#testing-support" title="Permanent link"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      VS Code can automatically recognize
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/unit-testing"
        >existing Python tests</a
      >
      written in the <code>unittest</code> framework, or the
      <a href="https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/"
        ><code>pytest</code></a
      >
      or <code>Nose</code> frameworks if those frameworks are installed in the
      current environment. I have a
      <a href="https://realpython.com/python-testing/">unit test</a> written in
      <code>unittest</code> for the equation eval library, which you can use for
      this example.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run your existing unit tests, from any Python file in the project,
      right-click and select <em>Run Current Unit Test File</em>. You’ll be
      prompted to specify the test framework, where in the project to search for
      tests, and the filename pattern your tests utilize.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these are saved as workspace settings in your local
      <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> file and can be modified there. For
      this equation project, you select <code>unittest</code>, the current
      folder, and the pattern <code>*_test.py</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the test framework is set up and the tests have been discovered, you
      can run all your tests by clicking <em>Run Tests</em> on the Status Bar
      and selecting an option from the Command Palette:
    </p>
    <p>
      You can even run individual tests by opening the test file in VS Code,
      clicking <em>Run Tests</em> on the Status Bar, and selecting the
      <em>Run Unit Test Method…</em> and the specific test to run. This makes it
      trivial to address individual test failures and re-run only failed tests,
      which is a huge time-saver! Test results are shown in the
      <em>Output</em> pane under <em>Python Test Log</em>.

      Even though VS Code is a code editor,
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging"
        >debugging Python</a
      >
      directly within VS Code is possible. VS Code offers many of the features
      you would expect from a good code debugger, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Automatic
        <a href="https://realpython.com/python-variables/">variable</a> tracking
      </li>
      <li>Watch expressions</li>
      <li>Breakpoints</li>
      <li>Call stack inspection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can see them all as part of the <em>Debug</em> view on the Activity
      Bar:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://files.realpython.com/media/vscode-debug-screen.647a68278472.png"

          alt="Finding the Debug UI in VSCode"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The debugger can control Python apps running in the built-in terminal or
      an external terminal instance. It can attach to an already running Python
      instances, and can even debug
      <a href="https://realpython.com/tutorials/django/">Django</a> and
      <a href="https://realpython.com/tutorials/flask/">Flask</a> apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debugging code in a single Python file is as simple as starting the
      debugger using F5. You use F10 and F11 to step over and into functions
      respectively, and Shift+F5 to exit the debugger. Breakpoints are set using
      F9, or using the mouse by clicking in the left margin in the editor
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you start debugging more complicated projects, including
      <a href="https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/">Django</a> or
      Flask applications, you need to setup and then select a debug
      configuration. Setting up the debug configuration is relatively
      straightforward. From the <em>Debug</em> view, select the
      <em>Configuration</em> drop-down, then <em>Add Configuration</em>, and
      select <em>Python</em>:
    </p>
    <p>

          alt="Adding a new debug configuration to VSCode"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual Studio Code will create a debug configuration file under the
      current folder called <code>.vscode/launch.json</code>, which allows you
      to setup specific
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_standard-configuration-and-options"
        >Python configurations</a
      >
      as well as settings for
      <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging#_debugging-specific-app-types_"
        >debugging specific apps</a
      >, like Django and Flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can even perform remote debugging, and debug Jinja and Django
      templates. Close the <code>launch.json</code> file in the editor and
      select the proper configuration for your application from the
      <em>Configuration</em> drop-down.

      VS Code has built-in support for
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol"
        >source control management</a
      >, and ships with support for Git and GitHub right out of the box. You can
      install support for other SCM’s in VS Code, and use them side by side.
      Source control is accessible from the <em>Source Control</em> view:

    <p>
      If your project folder contains a <code>.git</code> folder, VS Code
      automatically turns on the full range of

      VS Code will also recognize changes made outside the editor and behave
      appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Committing your recent changes within VS Code is a fairly straightforward
      process. Modified files are shown in the <em>Source Control</em> view with
      an <em>M</em> marker, while new untracked files are marked with a
      <em>U</em>. Stage your changes by hovering over the file and then clicking
      the plus sign (<em>+</em>). Add a commit message at the top of the view,
      and then click the check mark to commit the changes:
