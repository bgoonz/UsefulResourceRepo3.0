00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,190
Hello, friends, in this video, I will show you some tricks that will make development little bit

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,210
easier when creating components and importing them with the act.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,930
So if you look inside, index charges file so you can see where we import the component, they are using

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,090
it with a relative.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,750
But so we always have to type forward slash competence, slash layout, or if you are in a deeper subdirectory,

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,130
you have to type forward slash, dot, dot, forward slash.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,770
And as you can figure it out, it can become a little bit annoying, to be honest.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,880
So we are going to configure Gadsby to be to use absolute input.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:45,400
That means we can type it like this so we can remove all this dot, dot, forward slash.

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,790
But just before the conference, and we need to save this fight, so this will be an absolute import,

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,450
we will configure Gadsby with that, but it will also look into SC Fulda.

12
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,510
That's why we can type out component and forward slash layout.

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:12,060
So let's move ahead and then we need to go to Gadsby IFN or G.S. and Gadsby hyphen.

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,370
No Doges file is the file that Treneman gets people to your site and you can read more about it by going

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,960
to this.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,310
You are.

17
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,190
So let's go to the browser and let's visit their website.

18
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,910
So if you go to this Othell on their website, as I mentioned before, you can use the file if you want

19
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,680
to create dynamic pages.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,110
OK, so Utica's written in the text.

21
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,270
You can use it to create pages dynamically.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,810
OK, and we will also going to use it to add nodes in graphical.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,170
OK, so this file is very important to create dynamic pages and to create nodes and draftable.

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,900
So if you want to read more about it so you can just go through this page.

25
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,750
So we will create dynamic pages and Nojin craftspeople in my upcoming videos in the future videos.

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,810
OK, but for now, I'm going to use this file to set up a webpage when Gadsby created a config.

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,670
Now they have another page.

28
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,780
So if you will do this, you all let's be just dot com slash stocks, slash how to forward slash custom

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,900
configuration, slash add custom config, OK.

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:27,660
So if you want to search this file, you can just go to documentation and you're in to that is an option

31
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,270
of customization for tool.

32
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,190
And all you need to click on how to add custom, Bapak.

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,430
OK, so you will end up on this page.

34
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,240
So as you'll see, they have something for everybody in the documentation you want to do something.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,880
And they probably covered it in this documentation.

36
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,080
OK, so it's great.

37
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,410
So we have this instruction here.

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,710
What we want to do is we want to create absolute input.

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,490
So they have a section for that.

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,920
So let's scroll down.

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,220
So what is the section for this absolute import?

42
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:08,950
And it tells you all about how you should do it here and when Gadsby is creating your site and building

43
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:17,290
your site, you can export the function that's going on, create that one thing and you call this function

44
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,410
with different argument.

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,620
OK, so the first one is state and the second one is action.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,320
So we are going to use action.

47
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,360
So they distribute it out there.

48
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,880
And then from the actions we can call the sectoral config.

49
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,110
And this is where PAC stuff, OK.

50
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,420
When we set this up.

51
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,240
So if you want to know more about how it works, I will recommend you to read the official.

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:50,200
OK, so this function will take the part sirc OK, the subsea folder and said that as a default folder

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,870
for us so we can do absolute import with SLAC folder as Obie's.

54
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,410
So now let's go to results from your code and remove this.

55
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,450
OK, and here we will add a newcomer upcoming for.

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,220
Absolute.

57
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,360
Imports and we to export.

58
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,940
And the name of the function is on three.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,180
Funfest.

60
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:31,210
OK, which is equal to and we need other entities and inside we look at a daily basis and inside that

61
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:31,730
we will.

62
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,770
So here we are restructuring OK to action.

63
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,940
So actions and then we need an arrow function and inside this function and from our actions.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,870
We have something called said.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,670
The fact.

66
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,190
Config.

67
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,670
And inside those identities, we will take an object, and inside this we will give a property which

68
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,990
is called Resul and it will have an object and then we have module's.

69
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,180
And this is a very big stuff.

70
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:11,550
So I won't go into details on the big stuff here because it will take too long to explain them.

71
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,790
OK, so now Module's will have an array.

72
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,760
So first we have to resolved and inside this parenthesis we will at the store underscore the name.

73
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,320
And this is a directory which we are working in, so it's an old stuff and we sent it to ASIC.

74
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,780
So you're right, Foma and ASIC.

75
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:38,410
And the second element in our editor, we set it to No one does four more deals.

76
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,720
Like that, and then we have a comma, but let's save this file, and that is one more thing we need

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,930
to do as we are using pot.

78
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,170
So you're at the top, OK, before the summit at the top of the file, we will create a contest and

79
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,320
name it as so that we will take this one centimetre spot, which is equal to require.

80
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,720
And we need to step out and this part is something which is built in with notes so we can require that

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:09,900
one.

82
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,850
OK, so that's everything we have to do to set up absolute input.

83
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,500
So let's save this, see if we go to index charges.

84
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,180
So we have already moved forward slash.

85
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,800
So now this is an absolute import during the next Dargis.

86
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,120
So now we need to open the terminal by pressing control and key.

87
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:35,250
Let's stop this by pressing controls and then we will start over by writing and then start.

88
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,270
So we are getting some air.

89
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,430
Let's go to let's be.

90
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,090
I know dodgiest fighting Assad, see?

91
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,700
You're just giving me an issue, so let's see what is the subsidy is not defined.

92
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,110
OK, so you're we need.

93
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,230
Quotation mark.

94
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,590
OK.

95
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,740
And also we need double quotes, so let's see this and now let's run it again.

96
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,360
So control C and B and start.

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,440
So now it is the site that's built.

98
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,950
So let's go to the browser and check if I refresh, so everything is working fine.

99
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,510
So now this will make our development much easier.

100
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,330
We don't have to type forward slash all the time to, well, inputting the component.

101
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,980
So this is it for this lecture.

102
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,360
And I see you in the next video.
