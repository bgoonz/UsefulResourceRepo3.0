00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello, friends, in this video, we will talk about all the files that were created when we bootstrap

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,260
our application with the get subclan, so we need to click on open folder.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,150
And then we need to select our application, which is Gadsby IFN blog.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,050
OK, we need to select the folder and click on Open.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,660
So you are all the files in this folder.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,720
OK, so the folder is Gadsby hyphen blog.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,850
So all the files are in inside this folder that we have created when we bootstrap the project.

8
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,370
So the first one is with me marked on file.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,620
It is a standard marked on file.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,870
It tells you a little bit about how you can start the server and get subclan and a lot of stuff here,

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,200
OK?

12
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,490
So you can just read it if you want.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,700
Then we have a package log.

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,310
File.

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,800
OK.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,780
Then we have a package, Dodgson, and you can see all the dependancy here which are installed for our

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,610
application and this is Gadsby stuff.

18
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,870
OK, you have Gadsby image.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,530
That is one which we are going to use to optimize the image, OK?

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,790
And Gatsby is actually heavily based on plug ins and it has a lot of plug ins.

21
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:26,470
If you look at their home page, if you want to do something in your Gadsby site that is probably already

22
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,210
applying for.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,570
OK, so these are some of the plug ins which are installed by Gadsby.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:39,140
OK, so we are going to talk more about on plug ins later on, so I won't go much into details, OK.

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,420
In this lecture.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,930
So Gadsby Saud's filesystem.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:52,390
OK, so this plug in which we are going to use to source files and this one transform transformer shop.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,890
This one is also used to optimize the image.

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:01,990
Then we have prototypes which is used to verify our props and obviously we have free domain react.

30
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,780
OK, and then we have free helmet and this one is going to handle the stuffs which are in the high tech

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,600
on your site.

32
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:17,740
And then we have dependancy which installed prettier by default, but I have installed prettier in my

33
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,340
code editor.

34
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,620
So if I if you click on this icon and if you type prettier.

35
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,000
So here is the plugin, which I've already installed.

36
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,250
OK, so if you want, you can just search for this plugin and install in your code editor.

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,670
OK, so now we have Allscripts.

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,880
OK, so these are all the script.

39
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,620
So we have an Barrandov, OK, so once you type and start, this command will be executed and it will

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,430
start to get to be website, OK?

41
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,090
It will load the website in the browser.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,780
Then we have Gadsby developed.

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,750
So if you type in B.M., if you type in get to be developed, so it will again start the website and

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,690
it will all in the browser.

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,520
OK, so either you can type and bam start or you can type and bam get speed dial.

46
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,380
So both are the same.

47
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,320
OK, so but we will be using and start so it will run this command and our website will be loaded in

48
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,050
the browser then we have get to be built.

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,200
This is to build our website.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:33,090
OK then we have a but we will not go for testing so mostly we will use NPM start then we have four.

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,360
OK, let's go to the all the files.

52
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:45,660
So I've talked about readme package lock package start Jason then we have Gadsby SSR, dot js and this

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,730
is for server side tendering.

54
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,710
So we are not going to use this file in our post, so I will not talk more about it.

55
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,210
And then we have Gadsby hyphen node dodgiest.

56
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,410
This file we are going to use it is, it is in this file we are going to create all the post and pages

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,250
programmatically.

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,710
OK, so we will get back to that and then we have Gadsby hyphen config Dages.

59
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,440
It is the file where you will set up all your plug ins and the config for the site.

60
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:22,470
OK, and we will see in this and we will see all this in the coming up lecture's now we have to be hyphen

61
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,610
browser Dages.

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,880
So this is the file that we use for the browsers API and we will talk about this later when we will

63
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,020
set up the light and dark more than we have get ignored.

64
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,950
OK, then we have pretty good ignored fruitier that is all about to get.

65
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,770
OK, so now let's go to source folder.

66
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,780
OK, so if I click onto this folder, the era, the folders like component's.

67
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,980
So here are the premade components like ideology's image Dargis OK, and we have CCIS.

68
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,810
So Liotard Sears's.

69
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,230
So if you want to create a component, we will be creating our component in this folder.

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,600
OK, so let me closer's then we have image folder so we will copy all our images in this folder.

71
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,700
OK, this is for image.

72
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,710
Then we have four pages folder.

73
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,740
So your all the pages like by default that is indexed Dargis.

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,230
So this is all the code that you see and everything inside this page folder, everything inside this

75
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,980
page folder.

76
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,200
Gadsby automatically create a page.

77
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,580
OK, so if you create any page like about Dages so it will be due to this page.

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,060
OK, so let me close this closes then.

79
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,170
We have public folder.

80
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,940
So once your site is completed, then it will go in this public folder.

81
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,840
And of course we have node modules, OK, and cache folder for that.

82
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,920
OK, so that's the folder structure of all the files in this project.

83
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:59,010
So now let's move onto the next lecture where we will install the dependency which we need for this

84
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,420
project.

85
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,390
So I'll see you in the next.

86
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,690
We do.
