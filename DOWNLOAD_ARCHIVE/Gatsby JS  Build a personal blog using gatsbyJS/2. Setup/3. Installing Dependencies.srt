00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello, friends, in this lecture, we are going to install the dependencies need for our website and

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,930
we are going to use Magnon as the source for our content on our website.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,050
Then we are going to need a plug in to show the reading time, which tells us the estimate on how much

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,940
time the article will take to read.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,200
We will also use state opinions to create this style for our website.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,700
So that is also a dependency that we need to install.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,360
So first, let's start with the Magnon.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,820
So let's go to the official website, which is Gadsby just dot com and we need to click on Docs and

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,540
your inside.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,520
We will click on documentation.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,720
So you're so young you need to click on How to Guide.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,830
OK, so apparently it was open.

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,410
So if you click it together and inside this, we will click on.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,910
Routing and pages, and we need to click on how to add content using Mogadon.

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,970
OK, so let's click on this.

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,920
So your they tell us all about how to make your website work with modern files.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,230
So this documentation is very good.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,330
And if you scroll down, we need something called Gadsby source file system.

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,440
This one is already installed as we use the starter when we bootstrap our application so we don't have

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,370
to install this.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,130
OK, so then what we need.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,240
So let's scroll down.

23
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,160
So we need this in, OK, Gadsby, Transformers, Remarque, so this is the one which we are going to

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,710
install.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,420
They also tell us how to use this plugin, but that I will show you in another video.

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,330
OK, so I'm not doing that in this video.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,070
We are just installing the dependancy.

28
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,600
So this is the one which we need to install Gadsby transformer remark, OK?

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,340
So let's go to terminal, so I'll go to Israel, to the airport, and I will open the terminal by pressing

30
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,570
control and back to key.

31
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,790
So make sure you are in the right folder.

32
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,340
OK, so mine is going to be hyphen block.

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,890
So whatever name you choose for the website, make sure that you are in that folder.

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,190
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to type or maybe I just copy this.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,970
Let's copy this and go back to terminal.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,460
And let's be straight your.

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,740
And if you press enter, it will start installing this plugin.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,200
OK, now this plugin has been installed.

39
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,270
So now let's move on and now we will install Retime.

40
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,840
OK, so let's go to the website and let's go to the page like Gadsby, James dot com and here need to

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,640
click on plugins and you're going to search for lead.

42
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,420
Dame.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,940
OK, reading time, I think reading this is the one Gadsby, the mock reading that we need to click

44
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,390
on this.

45
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,170
So your other instruction, so they have you on.

46
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,360
But we will use and be installed.

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,960
OK, so let me copy this.

48
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,840
And let's go to Visual Studio Code and alert and be in style and I'll paste.

49
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,920
OK, Gadsby, the reading time and I presented.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,110
So this plugin is also being installed now we need to install side company plugin.

51
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,180
So let's go to the website and we need to write style component.

52
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,640
OK, get people against you.

53
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,880
Let's click on this so there is a line of code which we need to install.

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,340
So first, there are three things which we need to install.

55
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,840
The first one is Gadsby, plug in Styrofoam and then we have state competence.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,830
And then we need to be able then we need people plug in state.

57
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,750
So let's copy the entire line.

58
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,640
And let's go to Italy, to the airport and your old bastard.

59
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,610
OK, and presented.

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,560
So now this is also being installed.

61
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,760
So these were the plug ins, which we need for this project, so let's type and be and start to start

62
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,210
our environment.

63
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:43,990
OK.

64
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,720
So and boom, start and then press enter.

65
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:57,650
OK, now our website is running on localhost eight thousand, so I think it is already here.

66
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,980
So let me refresh.

67
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,550
OK, so our site is working fine.

68
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh, so that is great.

69
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,400
So we have installed everything which we need for this project.

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,740
So let's move on and I'll see you in the next video.
