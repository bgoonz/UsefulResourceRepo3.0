1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,400
I love to start working on Gatsby.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,820
We will use Gatsby to bootstrap The Gatsby side, so we need to go to the official website, which is

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,980
Gatsby, James Dotcom, and we need to go to dogs and inside we need to click on QuickStart.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,320
OK, so these are the steps to create a Gatsby website.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:26,430
So instead of the steps I will use and be X and be X will help us to get the latest version of Gatsby.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,530
When you bootstrap your application and that's great.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,800
So that is one advantage of using antiques so you can do whatever you want.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,730
If you want to follow the step, you can follow this or else you can follow what I am doing, ok.

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,670
I'll be using antiques so to use and and we need to go to Israel studio.

10
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,770
OK, so we need a good editor.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,360
I am using Visual Studio Code.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,530
If you don't have visual studio would just Google it as a and this is the FirstLine.

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,620
So you need to install this, OK, so this is Warmack, and if you are a Windows user, you just need

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,600
to click on this arrow and you need to download and install it and even you need to install JS.

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,680
OK, so your.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,450
Is the Narges website, and if you are a Mac user, just click on this Altius Virgin and if you are

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,280
a Windows user, just go to download and your the options.

18
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,380
OK, so just click and install it.

19
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,520
So there's two things you required.

20
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:30,210
OK, so now I'll go to a little studio code, which is my code editor and you're I'll open the terminal

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,480
by pressing control and practically OK, which is about the you and I want to create my website on desktop.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,160
So let me go to my desktop, which is next stop.

23
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,020
Now I'm inside my desktop and I will write the command and be X Gadsby's.

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:01,890
New, this new keyword will create a site for us and I'll keep the name of my Web site as speech and

25
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,280
blog.

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,420
OK, because we are creating a blog Web site, you can keep whatever name you want, OK?

27
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,840
And I'll press enter.

28
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,540
So it will take some time.

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,660
So now everything is in and we need to navigate inside the folder, so here we need to write code and

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,260
we need to read Gadsby IFN blog.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,450
OK, whatever the name of the site you have given.

32
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,020
So now I'm inside this folder and now we need to write and start OK and press enter.

33
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,640
So Gatsby will build the site, so it will take some time.

34
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,440
So here we have localhost eight thousand.

35
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:01,570
This is where our dev server is going to be and we also have localhost eight thousand four, which slash

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
and underscore to underscore, to underscore.

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,110
These are three in the school and then grad school.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,170
So this is the graphical editor that I'm going to talk about in the future videos.

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,280
And we will use this a lot in the schools to create graphical queries.

40
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,130
But for now, we will click on we will copy this localhost eight thousand.

41
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,600
OK, I'll copy this and I'll go to the browser and I'll pasted.

42
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,170
And as you can see, this site is working perfect, so we have successfully bootstrap our application

43
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,920
with Gadsby's.

44
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,320
So now let's move on.

45
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,790
So I'll see you in the next video.
