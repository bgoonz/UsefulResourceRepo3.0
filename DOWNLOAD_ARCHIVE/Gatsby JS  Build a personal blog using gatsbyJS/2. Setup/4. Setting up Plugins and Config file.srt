1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,770
And this we do we will set up our plugins for our project, so we need to go to Gadsby IFN config,

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,140
dodgiest file and we will close the site, but OK, so that you can see the code properly.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,030
So let's change the title here.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,060
OK, so your average right gets Gadsby.

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:20,940
Blog.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,570
OK.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,890
And your description, I will change it.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,790
I was right, Gadsby.

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,570
Tutorial.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:33,710
Site.

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,100
OK.

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:41,890
And I'll save it and I'll keep it as it is this description, you can write whatever you want, you

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:47,010
can keep whatever description you want, whatever title you want, you can keep it.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,570
And also you can change it.

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,130
But keeping as it is.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,240
So this is the site metadata, OK?

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,440
And then we have the property for plug in and plug in is going to be in.

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,490
OK, so you can add as many plug in as you want.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,500
So first we have Gadsby plug in React Palmach so that one is already set up for us.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,060
So after this I will press enter and I will add a key and we need to write the name of our plug in,

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,130
which we have installed.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,300
So a very Gadsby hyphen plug in.

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,250
Nathan stai Ivan component's.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,790
This is the plugin which we have installed to Stihler component, and we need to add a comma, so that

25
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,500
is all we need to start our company.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,830
Then we have a plugin called GameSpy Source File System.

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,630
Then you have some options that you want to provide for your plug in.

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,390
You can create an object like this, OK?

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,190
And there's always a property value type, the plug in name, and then you have option property where

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,300
you also provide an object with the option that is set for the specific plugin.

31
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,630
But if you don't have any options, then you can type it like this as a string as I did it here.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,060
But now we are going to have options because we are going to set up the file system to source our data

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,470
from modern file.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,830
So this plug in your Gadsby source file system with that plug in, you can tell Gadsby where you have

35
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,160
the file you want to use in your site.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,830
And in this case, OK, they are setting up the images folder.

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:30,150
And underscore, Vietnam is something that you have in order to get the current directory name and they

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,980
have set up the folder in the source and the source of our images so you can check.

39
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,630
So those images and here will be the images.

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:50,150
OK, so this is the part for images source and in Texas we have a folder for images and we can do the

41
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,020
same to set up the folder where we have our markdown files.

42
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,180
So in this case, I will copy this code.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,770
So let's copy this for.

44
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:07,090
And I'll press enter an old bastard, OK, remember to add up on my OK, otherwise it will be harder.

45
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,030
And you we need to change that and we need to change the name to content.

46
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,570
OK, so I need to give the name of the folder content and copy this.

47
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,990
And also we need to start the same thing.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,910
Let me save this file and in source folder we need to create a folder content.

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,420
So let's create this folder right away.

50
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,260
So contact.

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,900
So in this folder, we will have all our modern files.

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,130
Right now it is empty, but we will add to markdown files in the coming up like this.

53
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,270
Then we also have the plugin that will make all the Maldon files work for us, and that's the Gadsby

54
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,950
Transformer remark that we have installed.

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,370
So we need to create a new object.

56
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,640
OK, so you're idea.

57
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,730
Create a new object.

58
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,670
And your eye light is all.

59
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,500
And back and I write the name of plugin, which is Gadsby.

60
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
I often former.

61
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,950
I have some remarkable.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,510
OK.

63
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,820
Alabama.

64
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,560
And we need to write options.

65
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,780
Roland, and once again, we need to add an object and we need to give the property as plugin.

66
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,360
OK, it is plug ins and we are going to set up some plug ins for these plug ins.

67
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:35,030
OK, so as we have installed plug ins for reading time, so in the options object, we can have a property

68
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,740
of plug in.

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,300
OK, and then we have an eddy.

70
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,480
So let's add an array and all.

71
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,650
We need to add about back key and we need to write the name of logging, which is Gadsby.

72
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,080
I often remark.

73
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,020
I assume reading.

74
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,770
Let's save this, so this plug in Gadsby hyphen, transformer hyphen Remarque will transform all our

75
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,680
modern find suitable HTML in our project.

76
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,220
OK, and this plug in Gadsby hyphen Remak.

77
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,610
I find reading from time will help us to display their time.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,800
So we have successfully set up the plug ins.

79
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,680
So these are the plug ins which we need for our cause.

80
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,030
And we have also created the folder named Content.

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,440
And inside this, that will be my confidence again that I so in the coming up lectures.

82
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,120
Now let's go to Temenos.

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,440
So I'll press Tantallon back to Key and let's start the development environment by typing and beam start.

84
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,510
So I think we have done a mistake.

85
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,790
So yeah, we need to add up.

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,970
OK, let's say this now it will run so and be in stock.

87
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,950
OK, now let's go to the let's go with this.

88
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,360
But and let's go to the browser of the year.

89
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:58,770
So let me refresh so the site is working fine, which means we have installed all the plug ins correctly.

90
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,360
So this is it for this video.

91
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,640
And I see you in the next video.
