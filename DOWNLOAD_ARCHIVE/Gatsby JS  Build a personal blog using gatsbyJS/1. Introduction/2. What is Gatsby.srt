Hello, friends, in this lecture, we will talk about what good speech is, is, and the best place

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,700
to check is the official website, which is that speech is dot com.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,950
It has everything that you need to know about gas, which is there.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,580
Documentation is amazing.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,240
It is the best documentation.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,590
It goes everything.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,840
So you can see it, says one friend, Ben, to rule them all.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,570
This is our tag line that Gadsby uses on their site.

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:33,690
And this is true because we can build blazing fast website and apps using Gadsby.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,580
So why are these sites so fast?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,890
That's because they are static.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,670
And what a static site, a site which has only admin access and little bit of JavaScript and no database.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,690
And this is exactly what Gadsby will do for us.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,230
It will create static SDM and Cyesis and JavaScript files for us.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,620
And you don't have any connection with that database and that's why it is so fast.

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,120
This also means that you have some restriction when you create sites with Gadsby, because, for example,

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,970
if you have a site that is going to have a lot of dynamic data, a lot of calls to database and API

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,890
and stuff like that, maybe Gadsby won't be the best choice for you if you have a site that's going

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,930
to update the data every minute or so.

20
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:23,040
But actually you can build everything with Gadsby because Gadsby will by default recognize those things

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,600
which need to be dynamic.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,950
And you can create a site with mixed dynamic content and static content.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,240
Gadsby will create admin files, ccis and just to file for you, that's not connected to any data base

24
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,960
or stuff like that, you can just copy that to the server and get up and running.

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,810
That's why it is so fast.

26
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,050
And that is why you need to have a little bit of different workflow.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,570
If you have, for example, a blog that you are going to update with different blog posts and stuff

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,360
like that, like, for example, in WordPress, you change your post to create a new post and then you

29
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,190
publish it and it is published.

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,860
But you cannot do that with Gadsby because when you change the data, the site have to be rebuilt.

31
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,890
And this, depending on the size of the site, will take different time.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,180
I hope you understood what Gadsby is because it's B really is a static site generator.

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,190
It will create static files for you.

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,570
So you have to think in another way and not in the WordPress way where you always make requests to the

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,170
database.

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,940
And you can also source data from anywhere into Gadsby.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,800
That means you can have different content management systems where you can have markdown as we are going

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,600
to use this in our post and you can grab it from different APIs.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,700
So it is really flexible in that way.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,260
And then it builds the site.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,380
And internally, Gadsby uses graphical and react.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,260
And that's what we are going to be using in our course.

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,640
And Gadsby is actually a really good way to learn and react and graphical.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,880
But I would say you should have some basic knowledge of react and maybe a little bit of graphics, because

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,410
I will not go into details on how react works and how graphical works.

46
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,280
We will look at it and I will explain stuff, but I will not go into details on every aspect, for example,

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,820
on REAC.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,980
So this is it.

49
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,620
So please visit Gadsby website and go through the documentation so you will have a basic knowledge before

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,700
you start the schools.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,860
So this is a big Northcoast for Gadsby, but not for the and graphical.

52
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,580
So I'll see you in the next video.
