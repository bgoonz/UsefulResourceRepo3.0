Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:07,920
And this video, we will see what a different type of credit to render our data in order to render our

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,380
data.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,930
We have three options.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,340
We have static, we have beachbody and we have static ready.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,850
So in this case, I will not be too static, very competent, because this is an old way of rendering

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,480
the data.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,540
I will show you, Beachbody, and you started getting used to the query is added back at 15 Bandaranayake

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,280
who came out.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,820
And the only difference between page query and you stratigraphy is that in page query we can use variables

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,910
so we can have dynamic variables.

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,470
But a new static, you cannot have a dynamic variable as the name of this static query.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,790
OK, so this is it for this video and I'll see you in the next video.
