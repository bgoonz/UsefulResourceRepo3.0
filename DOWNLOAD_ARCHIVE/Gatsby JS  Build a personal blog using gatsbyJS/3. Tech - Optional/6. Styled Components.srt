Hello, friends.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,020
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,540
So before we start coding, let's talk about style.

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,150
So this is the official website where you are in this style IFN components, dot com.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,800
So style component is a label that uses CCIS in JavaScript.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,930
So it helps us to use a system.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,500
It helps to create a component, just like we create the component interact.

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,550
OK, but this component will have their own style and we can use it in our just days.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,580
OK, so it will make your code look clean and it is really neat to use it in the combination, which

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:32,820
is.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:42,360
So they have some example in this case they have created a button, a button confident, and then we

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,570
call the style function and then we import the style that has a property.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,600
In this case it is the ETEC and then we have the template letters.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,940
OK, so these are the template letters.

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,260
It starts here and it's Enzio.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,470
And inside this we can use our regular Cyesis, we can write our regular synthesis.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,750
And one more important thing that you have inside component that you can have props for then.

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,160
OK, so.

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,320
It is really easy to change stuff with different additions, depending upon the props that we send in

20
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,320
to our company and we will do in our course.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,150
So, as you can see, they have created a competent but incompetent and that if you scroll down, they

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,910
have used this button component in the disks.

23
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,190
OK, just like the regular company.

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,780
And it is actually if it is attacked, but instead of attack, they have replaced it with a button thumbprint.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,840
So it will act as a bullet.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,290
But all the styles of which we have given you will be applied on this button.

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:54,460
OK, on this attack or you can follow this was a brief intro, a little bit of control of this.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,340
We will be using more in our post.

29
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,780
And this is it for this video.

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,070
And I will see you in the next video.
