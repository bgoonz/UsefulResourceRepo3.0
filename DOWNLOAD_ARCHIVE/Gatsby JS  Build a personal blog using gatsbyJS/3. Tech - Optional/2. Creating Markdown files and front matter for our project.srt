00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,960
Hello, friends.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,580
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,480
In this video, I will create a modern fight required for our project.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,220
So inside content for the day right now, despite empty.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:18,650
So inside this folder, I did a new file and I lamingtons about God and my and disdain for Mukden.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,000
So my gun files as an extension of empty.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,070
So first we will create front market.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,600
What is front open to let me go to the bazaar.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,920
So as you can see, front my telephone, my daughter dying, my gun fights.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,660
So when you create a modern fight, you can include a set of keys.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,610
And you bet that can be used to provide additional data relevant to specific pages.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:48,040
And that will tell you this data is front fundamental and is denoted by the triple dash at the start.

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,990
OK, and at the end of the block.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,560
So we need to be to the place at the top and at the end of the block, this block will be placed by

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,210
a good speech as well as a front marker.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,110
So this is the plug in which we have installed.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,960
So it will be placed by this plugin as a front of the graphical API will provide the key value better

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,970
as data in the company.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,730
OK, so we need to create something like this.

20
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,320
OK, this is an additional information for the page.

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,910
So like the title, we can give out the image.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,590
OK, so let's do it.

23
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,480
Do a full.

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,730
And you're a. to triple dash.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,390
OK, and triple digit and I will write the first one, this type of.

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,790
So now the killer has to prove.

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:47,390
OK, so one thing you need to keep in mind is that after the polling, you need to give space if you

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,290
don't give space.

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,890
And if you're right, let's say that type of speech.

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,770
So you can see the entire thing is an audience.

31
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,340
So you need to give us space, too, so you will not get an edit.

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,690
OK, the first one is type and then we have paid.

33
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,930
So that is the date format is important.

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,410
So first we need to go with the.

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,020
So you is 2020.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,510
OK, then hyphen and then the month someone else and then hyphen and the date.

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,060
OK, so in my case, today is twenty seven.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,970
So twenty seven.

39
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,070
OK, now the third one is images.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,790
OK, so you can give me images or image, whatever you want.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,260
You can even give Imja.

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,350
OK, so this this can be anything, whatever you want to give, OK?

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,590
But this is important.

44
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,900
So please keep that in mind so you can give whatever name you want.

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,470
If you want to keep it image, you can keep it image and image.

46
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,080
Then for image I will give dot org slash.

47
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:05,450
Majors slashed and this image we need to create about IFN image, OK?

48
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:15,850
That is no image about an image started between my majors folder so that I can now select.

49
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,080
That will be page or maybe you can keep about.

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,500
Love, you can keep it manually or you can create dynamically.

51
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,950
So in our course, we will create dynamically, but still I will keep it as it is.

52
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,300
But in my upcoming lectures, I will show you how to create dynamically.

53
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,770
OK, then we have the.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,190
Of which can be aboutus beach, OK?

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,780
So let's say this, and now we have the content from our goal, so let's go to the browser and I need

56
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,510
content, so I just typed.

57
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,000
So this is our weekend music part of it, so let's copy this.

58
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,450
And so this will be considered as a paragraph.

59
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:21,140
OK, then I want to back so rehashes and then I'll read this.

60
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,230
Is.

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,160
And it's three.

62
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,840
OK, then again, I need some paragraph, so I think go up with this.

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,100
So automatic gunfire is ready for about a space of about a space, so this is it for this video and

64
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,350
I'll see you in the next video.
