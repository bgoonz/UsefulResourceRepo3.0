00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,620
I love this section is 30 section, if you already know what this smackdown and what is graphic and

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,380
then you can skip the section.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,880
So I will start with my.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,180
So what does Magdala so ureters.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,660
What is Mogadon?

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,050
So I just read this three lines.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,980
This will make you understand what is Mogadon then I'll show you that.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,860
OK, so let me read this out.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,410
So my is a plain text formatting Syntex aimed at making writing for the Internet easier.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,200
The philosophy behind backdowns is that plain text document should be labeled without missing everything,

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,750
but there should still be way to add text modified like list bold, etc..

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,690
It is an alternative to i w i g.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,910
What do you see is what you get editor which usually takes that letter gets converted to property.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,910
And so this editor, if you use WordPress you will find this kind of an editor.

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,260
OK, but if you use my phone and let's say if you want to make a word for what you have to do is you

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,690
have to add stick before and after this word so it will become OK.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,930
So I have a I don't need to go to the table of contents.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,920
If I click on that.

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,160
Let's say if you want an actual text, you just need to add a hash, OK, if you want to tag and just

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,870
need to add to hash.

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,230
OK.

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:23,710
Then.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,810
Let's take what is emphasis, emphasis, as as I told you, if you want to make something bold, you

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,060
just need to a straight before and after this word or you can just add on the line before and of this

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,360
word.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:45,010
And this is four identical and this is for border to stick, to speak to underlings, to underlings.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,490
And you can just combined with Astrachan, underline, underscore, and you can use this for strikeout.

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,500
OK, then you follow the example.

29
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,640
We can just take it out, then you have the list or the list.

30
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,280
Another list.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,820
We can just go through this, then you have links.

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,780
OK, then you have images.

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,260
So if you want to use inline image, you just need to add exclamation square because there have been

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,150
architects and before, after that there will be the you are locked up image.

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,310
OK, so you have other examples.

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,590
And then you can even have a table.

37
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,270
OK, so you can just go through this to choose.

38
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,790
OK, so let me show you something.

39
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,780
Let's see if I go to my results through Bellport.

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,330
Ed.

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,350
And let me put it on the beach a little bit afterwards, let's say if you want an actual time, you

42
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,450
just need to attach.

43
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,460
This will be at one.

44
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,940
OK, so this will convert converted into something like this.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,680
And that family will get clean water like this.

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,740
This will be one.

47
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,170
When you inspect and see that, you will see this is actually.

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,090
OK, something like this, let's say if you want to back then you need to add to hastag and then this

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,720
will be.

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,590
It's too dark.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,290
So this will be convert something like this adds to this, really added to that.

52
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,250
Again, that be.

53
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,420
So something like this, and if you want something in paragraph, then that's a.

54
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,670
We just need to type.

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,340
And this, too, will be the battleground this week, onward, both the things into paragraph.

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,250
Well, this next.

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,790
Will be converted, something like this.

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,930
In my don't file, you just need to write this way and in that statement, it will be an order to something

59
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,500
like this.

60
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,500
OK, so this is the beauty of Monkton, so I hope you understand what ASMOF down and how to use it.

61
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,130
So this is for this video and I'll see you then.

62
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,710
Next, would you like me to do this?

63
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,930
Thank you and goodbye.
