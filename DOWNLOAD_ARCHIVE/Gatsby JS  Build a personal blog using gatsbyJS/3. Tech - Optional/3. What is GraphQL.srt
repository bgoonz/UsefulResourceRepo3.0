Hello, friends, in this video, we will see what this graph so grad school is a query language and

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,950
a lot of people talk about it and some says it will replace the EPA.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,200
But the EPA widely used all over the world for different projects and it's not going anywhere soon.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,010
So I will not tell you who only learned cool.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,340
Because in the real world, you are most likely to work with the EPA depending on what project you are

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:26,730
working.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,020
But school is great and it will be popular in the future.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,570
And Gadsby uses graph internally to query for data.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,510
So we will use Graph Girl when we want to get some data, for example, from our own fight.

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,090
So here is some intro text about graph you.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,470
If you want, you can read it.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,270
If I scroll down here, it looks a lot like Jason object.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,480
You need to specify your data and you get better data.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:04,410
So this is graph tool query and you get it back as a Jason and it has exact same structure and it is

15
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,990
very easy to work with data in your application.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,240
So this is all about the graph.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,500
We will use graph a lot in this post.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,880
So this is it for this video and I I'll see in the next.
