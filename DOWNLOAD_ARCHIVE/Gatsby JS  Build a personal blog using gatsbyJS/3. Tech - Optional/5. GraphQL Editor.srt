00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello, friends, in this video, we will see the graphical editor, so when you start your development

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,690
environment in Gadsby, you also get the graphical editor to use.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,510
So this is the you are where you can find the graphical editor.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,810
So let's copy this.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,090
You are in and let's go to the browser.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,190
And yes, I pasted.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,500
OK, so this is the graphical editor, so this is how it looks.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,110
OK, so how does it work?

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,470
So in the left here, you have the explorer.

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,910
You can have data of all the queries that you can use on your Gadsby site.

11
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,610
And also you have some documentation.

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,710
OK, so you can also see the queries that you have here.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,980
This is everything you can query on your site.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,860
And this editor is used very widely in graphics.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,790
So let's close this right now.

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,190
It does not work for us.

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,180
So this explorer is very easy to use.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:06,850
For example, if you want to create our own data so we can go to we can go inside all my data, all

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,940
my remark, OK, and insert this.

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,730
We get data back in something called it just OK.

21
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,300
And then we have nodes.

22
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,020
So let's take on node and then we can select what data we want to query for.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,050
In this case, I want to query for XHTML and it's OK.

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,080
And this is for all Monkton files.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,880
As you can see, it pulls the query automatically and this is what graph Google query looks like.

26
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,890
It is very similar to adjacent object.

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,170
So and it will follow the same structure as the data you get back in your JSON object.

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,100
Now let's press the button.

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,770
So as you can see, we get the data back.

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,900
That's in our Monkton file.

31
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,020
OK, so this is very neat way to query your data.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,550
You can test geographical queries before you use them in your code.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,730
So this is all about graph Ed.

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,780
We will use it more in our course.

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,920
So this is it.

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,440
And I'll see you in the next to.
