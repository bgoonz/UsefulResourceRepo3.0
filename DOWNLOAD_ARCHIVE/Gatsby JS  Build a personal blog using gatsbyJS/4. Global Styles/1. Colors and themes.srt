1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,350
And this we do.

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:07,560
We will create a global stage for our components because we have some states that we want to have all

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,880
over the site and style component, have something to help us with that.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:18,240
It is a function that is called create global styles that we can import from that library.

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,530
So we will import that one and use it for global styling.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,030
And the first thing, we will create all the colors for our site and different teams.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,440
And that's what we are going to do in this video.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,660
So let's start so inside the SABC folder, we will create a new folder and name it as styles.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,690
OK, so.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:45,340
Slides and press enter and inside the slides folder will we will create a new file and give the names

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,850
global.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,940
Styles Dargis.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,350
And inside this file, we will write in both.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:08,830
Curly braces create global style, OK, only style, not styles from style components.

15
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,320
So this is a function which we are going to import from this celebrity style components, then we need

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,790
to import fonts.

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:24,710
OK, so I have downloaded the font so you will get it from the resources and just download it and use

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,900
it.

19
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,940
OK, so this is the these are the phones to fonts which are required.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,070
So I just copy this.

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,570
I just copy this and I create a new folder inside SAAC folder.

22
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,070
So.

23
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,290
Let's create a new folder and name it as font and inside, I need to paste it so.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,340
So let me drag it here.

25
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,160
OK, so these are the two points.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,170
OK, let me close this now, I'm going to import this.

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,510
Fonts, so import.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,870
And the first one is Nuni to.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,980
Regular.

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,970
OK, so these are two fronts, one is the need to regulate, and one is Ninetto Black.

31
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,830
So you need two regular from.

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,420
Font's Shlash, New Nito.

33
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,850
I am regular.

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,430
OK, so new to hyphen regular.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,560
Make sure you spell it correctly, OK?

36
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,600
And the second one is enfold.

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,590
You need to.

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,270
Black.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,980
It's from Fonds.

40
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,410
You need to.

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,860
Nathan Black.

42
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,390
Let me check it out, OK, Minuto hyphen black.

43
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,900
OK, we need to get the extension to the.

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,260
The.

45
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:10,530
OK, let's save this, and now we will create JavaScript object with our colors, so we will export

46
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,960
that so that we can import it wherever we want in our application.

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,180
So export const.

48
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,340
And we need to give the name of the constant with just colors.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,510
OK.

50
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,400
And then we'll trade the object and you're going to give the properties Cyesis properties, OK, the

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:42,500
first one is white, so the color for white is ash for OK, then we need to give them OK.

52
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,100
So make sure to have karma because this is a JavaScript object.

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,310
So semicolon will not work or comma will work.

54
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,990
OK, so now the second property of the.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,590
Which is going to be harsh.

56
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,970
When a.

57
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,860
When see 20.

58
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,520
OK, now the third one is deep, dark green and.

59
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,010
The hash and the hash code is four zero.

60
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,690
Four zero zero zero.

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,050
OK.

62
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,060
Make sure to give karma.

63
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:31,000
OK, so now Blue Shade of Blue Shade one, which is going to be hash.

64
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,770
Two, one five.

65
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,900
Nine, seven, three.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,270
Blue Shade.

67
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:49,450
To find the color code will be six F eighty six, and the last one is Blue Shade.

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,870
Three and the color code will be as Daewon.

69
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,450
Even and know, OK, let's save this.

70
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,080
So these are the colors that we are going to use for our site.

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,280
Now let's move on to create the object for different teams.

72
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,480
OK, so you're right, exposed.

73
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,680
So we have two teams on our website.

74
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,430
One is like team, and the second one is the team.

75
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,690
So we will create two object for photos that we can use later when we switch teams.

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,060
OK, so this one.

77
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,810
So I first had a great team.

78
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,670
So team and your inside the object.

79
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,520
I like the colors, OK.

80
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,040
And these are the colors which we have created here.

81
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,340
So first one is background.

82
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:52,430
Colors start dark gray, OK, from the colors we will grab.

83
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,890
This is the one which we have created, OK?

84
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,420
And the second one is menu background.

85
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:12,240
So that will be colors, dark blue, shade one, OK, then we have text dark, which is going to be

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,720
colors, dark blue shade to.

87
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,150
Then we have text mean.

88
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,690
He is going to be colors start new.

89
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:32,100
Shade, too, to OK, this is shade tree and this is shade to let me save this.

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,380
And then we have the last one, we just secondary.

91
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,790
Which is going to be Beller's.

92
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,620
Not blue.

93
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,200
Sheild.

94
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,600
Three.

95
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:55,260
OK, so let's save this file and now let's copy this entire code and let's based it down below here

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,110
and I'll give like a team.

97
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,000
OK, so life team and the background will be white.

98
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,350
So white, OK, and main background will be shade three.

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,410
Then next talk will be one and text main will remain the same and secondary will be.

100
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,770
Deep, dark gray.

101
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,920
OK, let me save this, so that's it for our light team.

102
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,380
So we are going to use this object later when we switch the team and I'm going to show you how to use

103
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,640
them.

104
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,440
And in the next lecture, we are going to create the actual spaces for our global standing.

105
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,060
So this is it for this video.

106
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,250
And I'll see you in the next video.
