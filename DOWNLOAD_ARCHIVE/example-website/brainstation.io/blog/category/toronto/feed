								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/2019-the-toronto-tech-sector-makes-it-big"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Toronto has rapidly risen to become renowned as one of the world’s top tech hubs, with a deep talent pool, innovative entrepreneurs and business-friendly government. And now, the money seems to be pouring into the biggest city in Canada like never before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a new report from private market data collector Hockeystick and Toronto-based innovation hub OneEleven, the greater Toronto area generated a record $3.1 billion of early-stage and venture capital funding in 2019 – a massive 68 percent increase from the $1.9 billion invested in 2018. There were more rounds, too – 316, up 16 percent from 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authors of the study say that “unlike many reports, this is not an estimation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using a combination of public and private data, we provide a unique snapshot of what’s happening in the GTA,” the report reads. “Each dollar value represented is tied to an actual deal or transaction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toronto’s tech sector has been feeling the love,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnTory/status/1228395370633449473"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mayor John Tory in celebrating the news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s behind this banner year and its hugely lucrative final quarter? We took a closer look.</span></p>
<h2><b>Life Sciences Leading the Way</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth quarter of 2019 proved to be the healthiest time of year for Toronto’s life sciences startups. Hockeystick’s report found that the 225 companies in the sector generated $302 million in early-stage investment over 16 funding rounds in the fourth quarter – roughly equal to the rest of the year combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the way was $114 million Series D generated by Geneseeq, an industry leader in next-generation sequencing for precision medicine that was founded in Toronto in 2008 before being incorporated in China in 2013.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was one of many late-in-the-year victories for Toronto’s life sciences sector.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MindBeacon, creator of a digital mental health treatment platform, raised $18 million as part of a Series A follow-on investment round, EBT Medical announced $10 million in Series A investment to further develop its non-invasive neuromodulation technology for pelvic health disorders, and Winterlight Labs raised $5.6 million to further develop technology that helps healthcare professionals assess patients’ brain health from short clips of their speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sector hasn’t shown signs of slowing in 2020, either. Already, BenchSci has raised $29 million Series B and Aspect Biosystems announced $26 million Series A.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Bullish Local Investors</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto’s breakneck growth couldn’t have happened without robust support from local investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hockeystick’s report found that the most active investors of 2019 – out of a total of 341 investors – included the Toronto-based likes of MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund, Round13 and Espresso Capital, alongside the Business Development Bank of Canada, iNovia and Real Ventures. And previously, Hockeystick’s third-quarter report found that 70 percent of funds invested in Toronto came from domestic sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that front, the fourth quarter of 2019 also brought major news to Toronto’s VC scene: Portag3 Ventures closed a $427 million second fund, the largest Fintech-focused venture capital fund in Canada and one of the largest globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portag3 has already deployed $115 million to local startups including Wealthsimple, Borrowell, and Clearbanc, so the new investment round can only bode well for Toronto’s thriving startup scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Effectively, if you’re a B2B fintech company, especially serving the insurance, wealth management or banking sectors, (Portag3) should really be your first call,” </span><a href="https://betakit.com/portag3-sets-sights-on-global-fintech-market-as-it-closes-427-million-cad-fund-ii/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive chairman Paul Desmarais III. “Because not only are we the biggest in Canada and one of the biggest globally, but we also have an embedded set of potential partners and relationships that could drive your business.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Fintech on the Rise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the third quarter, it was Toronto’s Fintech companies that were the talk of the town. The $776 million raised by the city’s Fintech industry by the third quarter had already exceeded the $691 million generated in all of 2018, with Vena Solutions, Wealthsimple and TouchBistro leading the way with nine-figure funding rounds. Meanwhile, the $300 million in new funding announced by Clearbanc stood out as the biggest deal of the year in Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there was more good news in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Koho announced a $25 million Series B round just six months after the initial close of the round at $42 million, while also striking a notable new partnership with National Bank. Positioning itself as an alternative to traditional banks, Koho plans to be “really aggressive in Canada in terms of our capital position and our leadership position in the market,” </span><a href="https://betakit.com/koho-adds-national-bank-and-drive-as-investors-with-25-million-cad-series-b-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO Daniel Eberhard.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The goal is to build the next great bank in Canada, and we want to be around in 50 years,” he said. “Three years ago, it was hard for a lot of people to understand that you could do this, and do this in a market of Canada’s size and have a really good outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, I think people are seeing that the economics are there, the growth rate is there and you can really do this and build a true kind of functional banking experience and challenge even an oligarchy as entrenched as we have in Canada.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Delphia raised $10 million Series A while making headlines by publicly unveiling its first product, a service that allows users to use their personal data as a source of capital that can be invested into the stock market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the biggest-money deals in Toronto’s Fintech industry occurred earlier in the year, the last quarter of 2019 also saw some notable mergers and acquisitions. Pungle was acquired by fellow Toronto-based company Berkeley Payment Solutions for an undisclosed sum while financial planning startup Snap Projections was scooped up by Vancouver-based WealthBar Financial Services.</span></p>
<h2><b>Powerhouse Startups</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, massive funding rounds for top Toronto startups Clearbanc, TouchBistro, and Wealthsimple made news through the first nine months of the year – but the second-largest deal of the year was yet to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, 1Password – a previously bootstrapped password manager that grew over 14 years without a penny from venture capital – announced a $200 million Series A round from Accel, the largest single investment in the firm’s 35-year history. It was also one of the largest-ever Series A rounds raised by a Canadian tech company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to understand all the enthusiasm about 1Password, which grew its B2B by more than 300 percent over the years leading up to the investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“1Password has been profitable since day one, really, and we have been growing really fast for 14 years, all without investment,” Matt Davey, 1Password’s chief operations optimist, </span><a href="https://betakit.com/1password-closes-265-million-cad-in-first-round-of-institutional-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “But things have really changed recently with all the data breaches that have been happening, and password managers have gone from an early adopter, heavily technological thing to a major trend that (is) not going anywhere anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final quarter of the year brought other notable funding rounds for Toronto startups. Workplace management platform Eden announced the close of a $25 million Series B round led by Reshape in November, SocialChorus received a $10 million debt facility from Espresso Capital, and Second Closet raised $13.2 million in its latest round of funding with an eye on expanding its self-storage business within Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The self-storage space is a few billion-dollar sleepy industry where ‘you build it and they come’ – that’s the model,” </span><a href="https://betakit.com/second-closet-raises-13-2-million-to-disrupt-billion-dollar-self-storage-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO and co-founder Mark Ang. “Our model is more aligned with what consumers today expect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news kept coming for Toronto startups as the decade wound down. Ritual announced its first expansion into non-English speaking markets, FreshBooks unveiled plans for its first international office (in Amsterdam), and Toronto’s Trufan acquired the New York-based social media analytics platform SocialRank.</span></p>
<h2><b>Seeds Sewn</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting note about all of this funding activity in Toronto? According to Hockeystick’s numbers, 54 percent of funding rounds were seed – and that can only bode well for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those notable seed rounds occurred late in 2019. Proptech startup Naborly, which developed a platform for tenant screening, announced a $7.5 million seed round led by Susa Ventures and First Round Capital to be put toward its product NaborlyShield, a service that guarantees rental income and lease terms for landlords and tenants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see a world where Naborly is the glue for the rental industry, improving the lives of tenants while providing landlords better data and financial security,” </span><a href="https://betakit.com/yc-backed-proptech-startup-naborly-raises-9-9-million-cad-seed-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chad Byers, general partner at Susa.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, EcoPackers raised $4.3 million in pre-seed and seed financing for its biodegradable bioplastics business, biotech startup AmacaThera closed a $3.6 million seed financing round, and Convictional – a startup with a B2B eCommerce platform focused on managing inventory – raised a C$3 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A graduate of Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator, Convictional actually shifted operations back to Toronto in part because of the city’s deep talent pool.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided after Y Combinator to move back to Canada to build the company here because we felt that for the kind of business we wanted to build, the engineering talent is incredible and is on par with what we saw down in Silicon Valley,” </span><a href="https://betakit.com/convictional-closes-3-million-cad-as-it-looks-to-disrupt-b2b-trade/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founder Chris Grouchy.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about how </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-toronto-became-a-global-tech-leader-in-7-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto became a tech leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-reasons-why-torontos-tech-industry-continues-to-soar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the sector continues to soar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the city’s growth is not limited to jobs in tech. According to the Rider Levett Bucknall Crane Index, Toronto is home to the most construction cranes in North America, with 97 currently in use. This is the second year in a row the Ontario capital has led the crane count, and what’s more astonishing is that there are another 393 proposed skyscrapers, with 10.1 million square feet of new office space in the pipeline for Toronto’s core.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Toronto – already the biggest city in Canada – is changing and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six construction projects that will have a big impact on Toronto’s tech industry.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>The Well</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread over seven and a half acres, and just down the street from BrainStation’s Toronto campus, The Well is set to make a large impact on the already tech-focused King West neighborhood. The mixed-use project, which is already under construction, includes five residential towers and two office buildings.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well.jpeg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-1024x781.jpeg" alt="The Well - Toronto" class="wp-image-10474" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-1024x781.jpeg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-300x229.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-768x585.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-960x732.jpeg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, the development will provide:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1-million-square-feet of office space</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500,000-square-feet of retail space</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,700 condo and apartment units</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 35,000-square-foot glass canopy atop open-air walkways</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thermal energy storage facility</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40- to 60-feet wide pedestrian street corridors and walkways</span></li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-1024x688.jpg" alt="the well project in Toronto" class="wp-image-10475" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-960x645.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2.jpg 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set for completion in 2022, the project has already secured two big-name tenants: e-commerce platform Shopify, which has announced a $500 million investment to take over the project’s signature office tower at the corner of Front and Spadina; and Spaces, the Amsterdam-based co-working office company, will have over 127,158-sq-feet of office space in the project’s second office tower.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>Sidewalk Labs</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2017, Google’s sister company Sidewalk Labs announced it would develop Quayside, a 12-acre site just east of the Downtown Toronto core. Since then, the company has released a 1,524-page-long draft master plan that was both praised for its ambition and criticized for overstepping its initial boundaries (and helping to bring on a data-driven, dystopian future). In short, there is a lot that remains to be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we do know is that Sidewalk Labs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says it will spend $1.3 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the “neighborhood of the future in Toronto.” And this investment will help create 44,000 jobs, $4.3 billion in annual tax revenues, and at least $38 billion in private sector investment by 2040.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 new mixed-use buildings, including thousands of new residential units, retail and office spaces. These would be the largest collection of mass timber buildings in the world</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Canadian headquarters of Google&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to extend the city’s light-rail system&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redesigned streets that promote biking and walking</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to reduce greenhouse gases by up to 89 percent</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Wi-Fi and a number of “sensors” that will controversially collect “urban data”&nbsp;</span></li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sidewalk labs Toronto" class="wp-image-10479" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs.jpg 2667w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>East Harbour</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located on 60-acres of land east of Toronto’s downtown core (and just north of the future Sidewalk Labs site), East Harbour is a massive commercial project that aims to be both a new employment node and a secondary transportation hub for the city. The plan calls for regional transit links and a mix of office, retail, and institutional developments totaling 12-million-square-feet.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed project includes:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will be the largest commercial development ever undertaken in Canada,” said John Sullivan, CEO of Cadillac Fairview, the development company now overseeing the project.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of this like Canary Wharf in London.”&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>Union Park</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, real estate giant Oxford Properties Group – the developers behind New York’s Hudson Yards –&nbsp;recently unveiled plans for a new 4.3-million-square-foot retail, office, and residential complex just north of the CN Tower.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes:&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><strong>Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Toronto has started construction on the 14-story&nbsp;</span>Schwartz Reisman&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation Centre.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directly across the street from the MaRS Discovery District, the Centre will house the university’s office for Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Partnerships. It will also be the home of the Vector Institute, an independent, not-for-profit corporation dedicated to research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once completed at the end of 2020, the project’s first tower will stand 49 stories and include 1.5-million-square-feet of office space, all of which have already been pre-leased. Microsoft is among the building’s first tenants, and the tech giant will occupy 132,000 square feet over four floors.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019: Toronto Year in Review</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of unprecedented progress in Toronto’s tech scene, 2019 brought Canada’s biggest city yet another year of breakneck growth, big-money deals, and major-league startup success.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we get set to ring in 2020, we thought it was a good time to reflect on the year that was.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most important trends and stories from a busy 2019 in Toronto tech.</span></p>



<h2><strong>Big VC Funding and Big Exits</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in a record-setting year for Canadian tech deals, Toronto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stood tall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with $1.4 billion in venture capital funding across 119 deals in the first three quarters of the year. That means Toronto companies received 30 percent of total dollars disbursed in Canada, with Montreal and Vancouver both coming in at 17 percent each.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clearbanc.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clearbanc-300x240.jpg" alt="Michele Romanow and Andrew D'Souza of Clearbanc" class="wp-image-10271" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clearbanc-300x240.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/clearbanc-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption>Michele Romanow and Andrew D&#8217;Souza of Clearbanc</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest deal of the year in Toronto was $300 million in new funding for Clearbanc. Borne out of an idea co-founder Michele Romanow had while on the set of Canada’s reality TV series Dragons’ Den – which is similar to the American Shark Tank – Clearbanc is disrupting startup funding by funding from $5,000 to $10 million in exchange for a steady revenue share of their earnings until it&#8217;s paid back.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is a major local success story, with this recent round of funding – which breaks down into $50 million Series B and $250 million for Clearbanc’s third fund, which it uses to invest – following a $50 million funding round in December and another $70 million round in November 2018.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[This] clearly indicates that the model is working. We’re finding a ton of customers where [revenue share] is a good fit,” Romanow recently </span><a href="https://betakit.com/clearbanc-raises-300-million-usd-to-take-entrepreneur-funding-model-global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> BetaKit.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Toronto companies raising nine-digit funding rounds included Vena Solutions, a cloud-based financial planning and analysis provider that raised $115 million in equity financing in January, and local success story Wealthsimple, which raised C$100 million in May in one of Canada’s largest-ever investment rounds for a fintech company, one that CEO Michael Katchen teased could help the company get into mortgages.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a pretty meaningful milestone for Wealthsimple,” he </span><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/news-100-million-investment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It will go toward making our business better, our software better and simpler and more powerful, toward growing our team, and getting more clients.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we also have this vision about becoming a financial institution of choice for our clients that can help them over the course of their lifetimes. Ultimately, I&#8217;d love to replace banks as our clients&#8217; primary financial relationship. It&#8217;s going to take us a long time to get there, but that&#8217;s our vision. It&#8217;s the next-generation financial institution.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What stands out about VC activity in Toronto in 2019, beyond those major deals, was the diversity of companies earning funding. Here are some of the other noteworthy 2019 investments in Toronto tech:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile rewards startup Drop closed a $44 million Series B round that was earmarked for accelerating growth and entering new markets</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintenance and asset management software provider Fiix closed a $40 million Series C investment</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning itself as an alternative to traditional banks, fintech startup Koho announced an additional $25 million Series B funding round in November just six months after the initial close of the round at $42 million</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipset startup Peraso raised $42 million in February</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital media company TheScore announced the closing of a $40 million strategic investment that will be used to grow and develop the company’s media and sports betting businesses</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contextual data intelligence company Flybits raised $35 million in a Series C round, bringing its total to-date funding up to $50 million</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech lending and payments provider PayBright raised $34 million in growth equity, bringing its total equity raised since late 2018 to $60 million</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another fintech company, Sensibill, raised $31.5 million in Series B to advance its A.I.-assisted decisioning and to unlock the value of purchase data</span></li></ul>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even later into the year, funding remained robust.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, in November the Toronto-based startup 1Password – a previously bootstrapped password manager that grew over 14 years the old-fashioned way, without a penny from venture capital – announced a $200 million Series A round from Accel, the largest single investment in the firm’s 35-year history.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given all this activity, it’s not surprising that Startup Genome’s 2019 Global Startup Ecosystem Report ranked Toronto in the Top 3 worldwide among cities for global reach and for early-stage funding per startup. And a new report by relocation experts Movinga ranked Toronto as the eight-best city for entrepreneurs moving abroad to start a business (it was the only Canadian city to make the list).</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were major exits and acquisitions making news, too. In June, Toronto-based Intelex Technologies – an Environmental, Health, Safety and Quality SaaS company – was acquired for $570 million by Industrial Scientific. In the same month, Onex Corporation acquired Toronto-based wealth management firm Glusken Sheff + Associates for $445 million.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in June, Wave Financial – founded in 2009 in the Leslieville neighborhood – was acquired by H&amp;R Block for a reported $537 million, marking one of the largest-ever Canadian tech exits.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kirk-Simpson-Wave’s-Co-Founder-and-CEO.jpeg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kirk-Simpson-Wave’s-Co-Founder-and-CEO.jpeg" alt="Kirk Simpson, Wave’s Co-Founder and CEO" class="wp-image-10275" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kirk-Simpson-Wave%E2%80%99s-Co-Founder-and-CEO.jpeg 533w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kirk-Simpson-Wave%E2%80%99s-Co-Founder-and-CEO-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></a><figcaption>Kirk Simpson, Wave’s Co-Founder and CEO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just shows that you can scale business (in Canada), you can drive incredible customer value here, you can build big business here,” </span><a href="https://betakit.com/wave-to-be-acquired-by-hr-block-for-537-million-cad/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kirk Simpson, Wave’s Co-Founder and CEO. “Our hope is that obviously, this kind of exit and liquidity means that our early venture capital partners will be deploying capital into the next round of startups, and some of our early angels will take that liquidity and once again reinvest into tech startups, and some of our employees will do the same.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that’s really good for the ecosystem.”</span></p>



<h2><strong>New Partnerships</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the rapid growth of Toronto’s tech scene was again aided by new partnerships and collaborations between the public and private sectors. And again, it was a variety of industries that benefited from these initiatives.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, the federal government announced $40 million in funding for the Atmospheric Fund to support low-carbon solutions in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, doubling the program’s endowment contributions.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this significant and strategic investment from the Government of Canada, TAF can do much more to accelerate urban climate solutions in a way that also builds resilience, creates jobs, and improves public health,” TAF CEO Julia Langer </span><a href="https://taf.ca/40-million-for-gtha-climate-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto’s innovation hub MaRS Discovery District was also frequently in the news.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaRS announced, alongside Microsoft for Startups, plans to open a new space for startups to receive business and technical training in the Discovery District building. MaRS also unveiled a new partnership with Export Development Canada to help Canadian science and tech companies expand internationally, and also benefited from the federal government’s $52.4 million investment into a growth and innovation network to help businesses scale up in the Waterloo-Toronto-Ottawa area. Of that funding, $17.5 million was earmarked for MaRS. That news was especially important given some controversial funding cuts from the provincial government.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Canada is now a destination for the world’s best and the world’s brightest, due to many of the policies that we have seen from (the federal) government. Top international talent is finally flowing north,” </span><a href="https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/federal-government-announces-investments-into-innovation-and-growth-within-tech-industry/110083"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MaRS Discovery District CEO Yung Wu.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Top investors, international companies, new companies that could be this generation’s Google or Apple – they’re making their home here now. They’re all creating this unique ecosystem.”</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST-1024x538.jpg" alt="MaRS Discovery District " class="wp-image-10272" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST-960x504.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Our-Space-YOAST.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other news, FedDev Ontario announced a commitment of more than $1 billion to foster startup and not-for-profit growth in Southern Ontario, while North America’s fastest-growing technology conference, Collision, further cemented Toronto’s tech hub status by moving north of the border for the first time. The 2020 and 2021 iterations will be also be held in the Ontario capital.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now feels like a special moment for Canada, and for Toronto,” </span><a href="https://www.businesseventscanada.ca/blog/editors-pick/collision-conference-moves-toronto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paddy Cosgrave, Collision CEO. “There is such energy in the city, such an open, cosmopolitan and global atmosphere. Great companies are being started and incredible talent is coming out of the region.”</span></p>



<h2><strong>Major Real Estate Deals From Major Tech Companies</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto has the lowest office vacancy rate in North America, with a vacancy rate of just 2.6 percent. Over a third of downtown Toronto office demand is coming from tech companies, so it’s not surprising that some of the biggest names in tech have become quite competitive when it comes to putting down roots in Canada’s biggest city.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company enthusiastically snatching up real estate in Toronto is Shopify, which opened its second Toronto office in May. The sprawling 180,000 square-foot space </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a roomy cafeteria with bleacher seating, a games room, a yoga studio, a wellness room, themed meeting rooms (including a Picasso boardroom and a Banksy phone booth) and two terraces.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 700 employees in Toronto – and plans to double that number by 2022 – Shopify already has an office at Spadina and Wellington and plans to add a third location at The Well once that building is complete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What excites us about continuing to grow in Toronto is that as one of our centers of research and development, our employees have the opportunity to build and shape products from scratch; our local teams can make an impact on our entire product portfolio for 800,000-plus business owners and their millions of consumers,” the company </span><a href="https://news.shopify.com/shopify-opens-new-office-in-toronto-with-plans-to-double-local-workforce-by-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best part is that their global impact can originate from North America’s fastest-growing tech center and most multicultural city in the world, Toronto.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other news, Google snatched up 24,000 square feet more office space in Royal Bank Plaza – as sister company Sidewalk Labs released its controversial $1.3 billion master development plan for the Toronto waterfront – Amazon announced plans for a new fulfillment center in Scarborough that would bring 600 more full-time jobs to the city, and work continued on the brand-new Canadian headquarters for Microsoft Canada, which will occupy 132,000 square feet of a new CIBC Square tower when it opens in September 2020. That’s part of a $570 million investment from Microsoft in its Canadian operations that is expected to help grow its staff here by more than 500 full-time employees with an additional 500 co-ops/internships by 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies with new Toronto offices in development include Accenture, which is in the midst of creating an innovation hub in Scotia Plaza expected to add 800 new jobs; NVIDIA, which is investing in a new AI research lab; and Uber, which will vacate three spaces in the city to move most of its Toronto workforce to a five-floor office that will eventually house 400 employees and the company’s first engineering hub in Canada.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Toronto tech office is going to build software that is going to be used by Uber worldwide,” Engineering Hub Site Lead Kare Kjelstrom </span><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/05/21/uber-gears-up-for-expansion-of-toronto-operation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Toronto Star. “We are creating a synergy effect … and opportunity here, so I am pretty sure that as soon as it’s known that Uber has a strong tech presence in Toronto, it will attract Canadians abroad to come home.”</span></p>



<h2><strong>Growing Startups</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve covered the startups receiving major influxes of cash in 2019, but aside from the financial good news, there were other encouraging signs for Toronto startups this past year.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth again noting the diversity of the city’s startup ecosystem. Startup Genome’s report singled out Toronto’s Life Sciences and A.I., Big Data and Analytics industries as being particularly robust, but truthfully, Toronto startups are succeeding across all sectors.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of LinkedIn’s 25 Top Startups in Canada for 2019, 21 were based in the Toronto area – or 84 percent of the companies listed. Those startups included the aforementioned giants Wealthsimple, Clearbanc, and Drop as well as employee benefits platform League, customer intelligence platform Integrate.AI, and fine jewelry retailer Mejuri, which raised $23 million Series B in April.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto startups were also well-represented in the Canadian Business Growth 500 index of the country’s fastest-growing companies, led by mobile ad platform Cluep and its astonishing five-year growth rate of 11,433 percent. IT service management company Prodigy Ventures (8,372 percent growth), digital marketing platform Maropost (7,668 percent), and rate comparison platform LowestRates.ca (5,230 percent) were also represented in the Top 15 companies.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Toronto also had by far the most startups of any Canadian city make the cut of Deloitte’s 2019 Technology Fast 500 Ranking, including:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecopia Tech, an A.I. company that specializes in extracting insight from geospatial big data, which Deloitte said grew by 6,186 percent</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product roadmap software Roadmunk</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RFP software company Loopio</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail platform Tulip, a mobile app that helps retail employees look up products, manage customer information, and check out shoppers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumble, a digital media company that helps website owners and content creators with rights-cleared content</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And programmatic native advertising platform StackAdapt</span></li></ul>



<h2><strong>Opportunities Abound in Toronto</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.-.jpeg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.-.jpeg" alt="Paul Morassutti, CBRE Canada Vice Chairman" class="wp-image-10276" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.-.jpeg 400w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.--150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.--300x300.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.--109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/BRE-Canada-Vice-Chairman-Paul-Morassutti.--100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><figcaption>Paul Morassutti, CBRE Canada Vice Chairman</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto is North America’s third-best market for tech talent according to CBRE’s 2019 Scoring Tech Talent report. Even more impressive than that result is how quickly it happened; Toronto’s pool of tech talent grew faster than any of the 50 markets measured, adding an astounding 80,100 tech jobs in the past five years for a 54 percent increase. Toronto nearly equaled the number of jobs created in the Bay Area over that period.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth pointing out that those are good jobs being created, too; CBRE’s breakdown found that Toronto’s tech workforce brought home an average wage of $81,828, compared to $57,212 for the city’s non-tech occupations.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hear about tech more and more, but in a thriving city like Toronto, the impact of tech companies and the growing influence of tech talent cannot be overstated,” </span><a href="https://www.cbre.ca/en/about/media-center/torontos-tech-trajectory-sees-the-city-rise-to-no-3-in-cbres-north-american-talent-ranking"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CBRE Canada Vice Chairman Paul Morassutti. “Tech job growth has a multiplier effect in the economy and the influence of tech is re-shaping virtually every sector of real estate (in Toronto).”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, CBRE’s breakdown also found that Toronto provided the best value when it comes to cost and quality.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s certainly held true for Regan McGee, CEO and Co-Founder of Toronto startup Nobul – an online marketplace that helps link home buyers and sellers – who says that Toronto’s tech talent is simply second-to-none.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a good environment when you are trying to do something that requires engineering and tech,” McGee </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/why-canada-is-becoming-a-start-up-mecca-rivaling-silicon-valley.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The skillset of the people here is first-rate. You get the best from the best around the world.”</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-things-we-learned-about-torontos-tech-boom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Toronto has evolved into one of the world’s premier tech hubs with a growth rate unmatched by any other city in North America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, which innovative companies are powering that boom? Here are seven of Toronto’s top startups to watch.</span></p>
<h2><b>League</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to upending the health benefits market in a short time, this startup – founded by serial entrepreneur and Kobo Founder Michael Serbinis – is truly in a league of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">League promises to drastically improve the health benefits experience for companies and employees alike, providing flexible, customized plans that allow employees – and they’re specifically focused on millennials – to allot coverage to suit their needs. Since launching in 2014, they already have hundreds of corporate clients in North America, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Facebook, Shopify, and Unilever Canada. They’ve also won over investors – including a $62 million funding round in July 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employers experiencing the war for talent, skyrocketing healthcare costs, and the mental health epidemic are rapidly recognizing that a new approach to benefits will give them a competitive advantage,” </span><a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/league-inc-raises-c62m-to-transform-health-benefits-market-688970301.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Serbinis. “Health benefits represent a tremendous opportunity to improve the lives and health outcomes for employees, but they’re not currently driving the business value employers should expect from their investment.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Ritual</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in Toronto in 2014, Ritual has indeed become part of the daily routine for hungry office workers around the world.</span></p>
<div class="lead-grid-container">
<div class="lead__card">
<div class="lead__image"><img class="hide--mobile" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/OnlineLearning.jpg" alt="Icon"></div>
<div class="lead__content">
<p id="lead__heading" class="heading--4">Develop new digital skills to boost your career – from home!</p>
<p class="lead__description">BrainStation offers <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=blogPost&amp;utm_campaign=blogLead#,online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Online Live Certificate Courses</a> in data, design, development, marketing, and product management. Attend live classes and interact with Instructors and peers from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p id="lead__button--margin"><a id="lead__button--hover" class="lead__button" href="https://brainstation.io/book-call?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BlogPost&amp;utm_campaign=blogLead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speak to a Learning Advisor</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app allows coworkers to smoothly coordinate restaurant orders for pick-up while bypassing lines. Ritual expanded the business to Chicago and Boston in 2017 and by the end of 2019 will operate in 40 cities, including London and Sydney, and also plans to triple its restaurant count. It helps, perhaps, that the company’s fee structure (which it doesn’t disclose publicly) is said to be much more vendor-friendly than delivery apps. The startup raised </span><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-meal-ordering-app-ritual-raises-us70-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$70 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in funding in June 2018 – at a valuation of $300 million – that will be used toward continued expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud of the progress we have made in such a short period of time,” said co-founder and CEO Ray Reddy. “Because of our solid business fundamentals, we’re now positioned to rapidly scale our business and move into many more markets this year. We are excited to become a truly global brand.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Top Hat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It used to be that smartphones were the enemies of teachers and professors everywhere – until Top Hat turned that idea on its head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Hat is a platform that allows educators to take attendance, administer polls, and share lecture notes through students’ mobile devices, while also delivering online homework and interactive content. Founded in 2009 by Mike Silagadze and Mohsen Shahini in a small apartment near the University of Waterloo, Top Hat is now used at 75 percent of the leading 1,000 colleges and universities in North America, reaching millions of students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named the top Canadian startup at the 2017 TechVibes Canadian Startup Awards, Top Hat also takes care of its employees: perks and benefits include full medical, health and lifestyle benefits, free lunch, breakfast and snacks, employee stock options, and opportunities for career advancement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach 750 post-secondary institutions in only a decade would seem quite the accomplishment, but Silagadze isn’t satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve actually been bummed out it hasn’t happened faster,” he </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2017/09/15/vanguards-top-hat-ceo-mike-silagadze"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s so much better. It’s just so much better. Top Hat is cheaper and more interactive than anything else. Why isn’t everyone using this yet? We’re growing quickly but I feel like we should be in every classroom by this point.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Wealthsimple</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a mission to reach millennials by simplifying the world of finance – “investing on autopilot” is the company’s catchy promise – Wealthsimple has already made a lot of people a lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup brings clients investments without high fees or account minimums often associated with big banks, along with other services – automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvestment, and tax loss harvesting – that were largely reserved for the wealthy. Less than five years after being founded in Toronto by Michael Katchen, Wealthsimple now has 150,000 users and manages $4 billion in assets. The startup also won back-to-back Webby awards for the world’s best financial services website, and it was also included in the Globe and Mail’s roundup of the top 10 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best places to work in Canada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are believers in the company too; a $100 million funding round in May brought total funding to $266.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our vision is to build a crazy, successful, huge company, and really change the lives of millions of people,” Katchen </span><a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/news-100-million-investment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in announcing the funding. “I see it as an innovation fund – to make more and better products, to do what we do better and more efficiently, to bring powerful financial products to people who’ve never had them before.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Flipp</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The days of cutting coupons from flyers are over for most shoppers, but everyone still wants to save money – enter Flipp. Now the No. 1 provider of digital circulars in North America with 50 million-plus downloads, Flipp uses a proprietary platform to transform print circulars into an interactive experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, Flipp’s client roster is impressive – the startup says it works with 90 percent of the largest retailers in North America, including Walmart, Ikea, and Home Depot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another startup singled out by the Globe’s best places to work in Canada roundup, Flipp offers extensive perks – and in fact, the startup’s leadership views those benefits as a crucial part of its culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take a people-first approach to our benefits and perks, which means we look at what’s important to our specific teams based on their life-stage, priorities, and preferences,” </span><a href="https://hiring.workopolis.com/article/flipp-attracts-top-talent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Au-Yeung, Flipp’s Co-Founder and Chief People Officer. “We want our team members to enjoy all aspects of their life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s most important is the freedom and responsibility that we give our team members. That means unlimited vacation (minimum three weeks), the option to work from home, and flex hours. We also promote a healthy lifestyle with a complimentary Goodlife membership as an example. Our team members enjoy family-style Friday lunches, a leading benefits package, including a competitive parental leave top-up, complimentary transportation, whether it’s TTC passes or parking, and much more.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Flow</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Nicholas Reichenbach was leaving Burning Man a few years ago, he looked with dismay at the mountain of plastic water bottles being hauled out at the end of the festival and an idea came to him: Couldn’t something more sustainable be produced? From that observation came Flow, which packs its alkaline spring water in a 68 percent renewable and 100 percent recyclable paperboard pack (it also helps that Reichenbach’s family has owned an artesian spring in South Bruce County, Ont., for five generations).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, he was onto something. As of the end of 2018, Flow was sold in 15,000 locations across North America and the startup expected to sell 100 million packs by 2020. Flow also has powerful celebrity allies in Gwyneth Paltrow and Shawn Mendes and remains committed to its environmentally responsible roots – in fact, the startup’s goal is to produce a 100 percent sustainable pack by 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I asked my dad for permission, he told me that I could develop the spring on the basis of two things: one, you never take more than what is given to you and two, that you never build a factory on top of the spring,” Reichenbach </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/meggentaylor/2018/10/25/flow-alkaline-spring-water-say-bye-to-plastic-water-bottles-and-hello-to-mindful-hydration/#246cf9f234ea"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “His grandfather kept it that way. His father kept it that way, and I will keep it that way. We have to be sustainable.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Tulip</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile app that helps retail workers to look up products, manage customer information, and check out shoppers, Tulip is suddenly a fixture at stores around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app – which ultimately aims to elevate the shopping experience, boost sales, and improve customer service – is now used by six of the top 10 luxury brands in North America and counts clients including Chanel, De Beers Jewelers, Coach, Saks Fifth Avenue, Kate Spade, and Michael Kors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is special for another reason. Tulip’s CEO and founder, Ali Asaria, announced at a company Christmas party that he was going to donate, through a binding pledge, 80 percent of his shares in his firm to a charitable trust controlled by employees – so if the startup gets sold or goes public, 80 percent of those proceeds would go to charity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really passionate about using this as a story of why you should join Tulip,” Asaria </span><a href="https://tulip.com/articles/ali-asaria-the-tech-ceo-who-gave-away-his-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think it will be interesting for us to be able to tell new candidates, ‘Hey you can go and work for a traditional startup and make the Founder very wealthy. Or you can work at Tulip, and we can jointly try to build a multibillion-dollar charity that could transform the world, and we’ll all have a piece in that.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that means a lot, especially to a next-generation worker who is looking for more in their job than salary and perks.”</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a century-old boutique hotel stay ahead of industry trends and emerging technology? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of the <a href="https://www.gladstonehotel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gladstone Hotel</a> in Toronto, you focus on storytelling, community building, and digital skills training. We spoke to Tara McCallum, the hotel’s Director of Marketing and Communications, to find out more about how the Gladstone has stayed at the forefront of the hospitality industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><b>BrainStation: </b><b>What challenges is the Gladstone Hotel, and the hospitality industry as a whole, facing right now? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCallum: Hospitality is definitely a volatile industry &#8211; luckily we are located in one of the most booming tourist destinations in the world. The city had a record-breaking year for visitors in 2017 and the numbers are expected to continue growing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Gladstone, our two biggest challenges are our love/hate relationship with Online Travel Agents (OTAs) who take a substantial commission for every booking but are excellent for awareness, as well as vacation rental sites like Airbnb and VRBO who attract our target demographic. To add to this, there is increasing competition from boutique hotels popping up all over the city!</span></p>
<p><b>The Gladstone Hotel was built in 1889, how do you bridge the gap between maintaining the historical elements while trying to keep up with digital trends?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gladstone Hotel is a contemporary and forward-thinking brand housed within a meticulously restored Victorian building. We take our mantra from Jane Jacobs who famously said: “New ideas must use old buildings.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an artist-run hotel, we approach our digital presence a little differently. We’re always questioning “digital trends” and only employ tactics that fit the strategic objectives of our business.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9155" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CUTMR2018_FINAL-4-1024x684.jpg" alt="Art installation at Gladstone Hotel" width="1024" height="684" /></p>
<p><b>What would you say are the core elements of the Gladstone Hotel&#8217;s digital strategy?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re storytellers first. As a mixed-use space that functions as a hotel, art gallery, event venue, restaurant, and bar, we have no shortage of content. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an independent business, we can’t compete with the paid campaigns of hotel chains and OTAs, so we use our content to our advantage by concentrating on content marketing fueled by targeted SEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also included earned media into our digital strategy, and have had success with earned media, link-backs and of course online reviews. Our email newsletter and social media platforms are also key in engaging our audience and getting eyes on our content.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><b>You have a lively presence on social media, with a strong following. How did you go about building a community on these platforms?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the physical space, the Gladstone Hotel is a community meeting place – we’ve tried to replicate that on social media. We’ve maintained an accessible voice and have rejected the generic “stock photo” aesthetic of many of our competitors.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9154" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CUTMR2018_FINAL-229-1024x684.jpg" alt="Gladstone Hotel events" width="1024" height="684" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We try to keep our social media presence as authentic as possible so our community feels connected to the culture of our hotel. Just as we do on the ground, we partner with local businesses and fellow B-corporations on social with the goal of building a diverse, socially-minded and creative online community. </span></p>
<p><b>As a boutique hotel, your team must be relatively lean. How do you manage to implement your digital strategies across multiple channels?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve automated predictable campaigns – for example, we’re currently working on campaigns for 2020 that we’ll set and forget, giving us more time and flexibility to make adjustments and work on real-time campaigns. We schedule and plan as far in advance as possible and work with local photographers and artists to keep our content fresh and relevant. </span></p>
<p><b>You recently sent three team members to BrainStation for digital skills training in SEO, Web Development, and Social Media Marketing. What were some of the reasons why your team sought out this training?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, we’ve used external digital marketing agencies to assist with paid campaigns. We weren’t seeing the results we hoped for, so I wanted the team to educate themselves so we could ask the right questions of our third-party service provider(s). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/seo-sem-analytics">SEO/SEM</a> and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a> courses gave us the baseline knowledge we needed to restructure our existing campaigns and properly define expectations. The <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/intro-to-web-development">Web Development course</a> was excellent professional development for our graphic designer and will be helpful as we move into a complete website redesign with a local web design studio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t claim to be experts in any of these fields quite yet, but it’s given us the ability to have a better and realistic understanding of what we can accomplish in-house and where we need to seek help from third-party service providers.</span></p>
<p><b>What sort of impact has this training had on operations?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re able to work much more efficiently in-house and use our external vendors more effectively. It has also been great for team engagement and has motivated us to keep learning and sharing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><b>How do you see the Gladstone Hotel’s digital strategy changing in the future? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We plan to continue to lead with content and put a larger emphasis on more traditional digital tactics such as our email newsletters and blogs. We are also extremely excited to launch our new website this fall/winter which will be a game-changer as we’ll finally have the content hub of our dreams!</span></p>
<p><b>What roles/skills do you believe to be most important going forward for the digital strategy to continue to be effective? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many platforms we’ve relied heavily on in the past (e.g. Facebook) have become increasingly expensive and difficult to navigate as a marketer. In order to maintain our reach and engagement, we’ll have to continue to use an omnichannel approach which requires the skills of marketing generalists and content creators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing generalists are key in a small organization as they can see the larger picture and won’t beat a dead horse trying to make one tactic or platform work. Content creators bring the brand to life and build brand loyalty while inspiring action!</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With conference season upon us, it’s a good time to revisit our networking skills to make the most out of events. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Networking, after all, can be daunting, especially at a conference where you’re surrounded by hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of professionals who seem like they’ve trained for this their entire career. To help, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e spoke with Derek Plewes, Career Success Manager at <a href="https://brainstation.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainStation</a> and got his top tips for networking at conferences. </span></p>
<h2><b>Start by Making a Plan</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all too easy to attend a conference, hang in the background, and not get much out of it. The best way to avoid this is to be prepared ahead of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-8929 " src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/0N5A8438.jpg" alt="Derek Plewes" width="343" height="390" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/0N5A8438.jpg 2714w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/0N5A8438-264x300.jpg 264w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/0N5A8438-768x874.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/0N5A8438-900x1024.jpg 900w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/0N5A8438-960x1092.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px" />Do your research, know who the keynote speakers are, when they’re speaking, and what other talks or workshops you would like to attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Focus on research and self-awareness,” says Plewes. “Gaining a thorough understanding of what key companies, speakers, and topics will be featured will help you make the most of the experience. It also helps to generate conversation with new contacts if you&#8217;re aware of everything going on at the conference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a schedule in advance, being careful to include the dinners and extra activities that are happening each day. These social events are a great opportunity to meet people in a more natural environment.</span></p>
<h2><b>Set Measurable Goals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to ensure that you don’t take a backseat is to set measurable goals for yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Set goals. It’s easy to be passive and not get much out of an event if you don’t have a clear purpose heading into it,” explains Plewes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the goals don’t have to be lofty, in fact, the more attainable the better. You’re more likely to feel confident and inspired to meet a realistic goal like “collect 10 business cards from potential project collaborators” than one that’s too far fetched, for example, “find someone to invest in my business idea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conferences are all about planting the seed – making a connection with someone that can be built upon afterward.</span></p>
<h2><b>Brainstorm Conversation Starters</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds cheesy, but having questions and conversation starters ready will spark more interesting connections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d always suggest preparing a few unique questions before an event,” says Plewes. “Get people talking about what excites them. Because of the number of times people at conferences get asked ‘what do you do?’ that conversation turns into an automatic response rather than an engaging exchange.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of the standard ‘where are you from?’ question, branch out by diving right into interesting topics. Here are some of Plewes&#8217; go-to conversation starters:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exciting projects are you working on right now?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a more interesting way of finding out what they do, while inviting them to open up the conversation beyond simply stating their job title.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you think are the biggest challenges facing our industry?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get people’s opinions on macro-level issues facing your industry. They’re likely to offer insight that will start a meaningful conversation.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you always worked in this field?</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many people have a varied background,” explains Plewes. “Ask them about their career path and previous experience and you might find that you have more common ground.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Follow-up and Follow Through</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large part of having a successful conference experience depends on what steps you take once the event is over. A crucial step is to send follow-up emails to new contacts, including a specific detail from your conversation so that you stand out from the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Follow-ups are a simple tactic, and yet so many people forget about them,” says Plewes. “Some people take a few notes on the back of business cards, on their phone, or in a small notebook so that it’s easier to recall the details of the conversation. These small efforts go a really long way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, make sure that if you offered to help someone, you follow through on that promise. People often get caught up in networking for personal gain, but ensuring your connections get value out of your relationship is equally important.</span></p>
<h2><b>Put Yourself Out There</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, remember that one conference may not give you everything you need. It may take a few before you get comfortable and have mastered getting the most out of the experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Conferences are one of the most valuable ways to network because there is no other setting that concentrates like-minded people in the same field into one place,” says Plewes. “They also dramatically increase the number of face-to-face interactions you have. Strategically putting yourself in the position to have these conversations ultimately gives you the opportunity to develop stronger relationships.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada may be cold six months of the year — but it may end up being a hot place for international tech talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various factors are now driving global workers to head north for jobs, in everything from product design to e-commerce to artificial intelligence. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Vikram Rangnekar, founder of MOV North — a website helping tech all-stars head to Canada — it’s a trend that shows no sign of slowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Canada has a great brand,” he says. “What was missing was the tech brand: Is Canada a place to go to for cutting-edge work in tech? And I think that piece has kind of fallen into place now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at why international tech talent is coming to Canada in greater numbers. </span></p>
<h3>The Impact of Canada’s Global Talent Stream</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be impolite to discuss politics, but it is difficult to avoid when it comes to Canada’s tech industry. Following the Trump administration’s travel ban, </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90297446/how-trumps-travel-ban-has-altered-immigration-in-the-last-two-years"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immigration to the U.S. has dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from various blacklisted countries. The president’s proposal to crack down on the H-1B visa program, which allows 85,000 foreign workers in “specialty occupations,” has also created </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/silicon-valley-companies-craft-plans-to-move-foreign-born-workers-to-vancouver/2017/02/10/3f581b06-ee34-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.c82c80d1cfb9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a climate of uncertainty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t come across as positive to people who want to move there,&#8221; Rangnekar says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada is benefiting from this perception, and it is very much by design. The federal government has tweaked its immigration process, giving applicants for permanent residence extra points for tech skills. The spouses of temporary visa holders are now also allowed to work. In 2017, the government launched the Global Talent Stream, a 24-month pilot, which helps Canadian tech companies recruit and retain skilled talent from around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program fast-tracks the immigration and work visa processes, allowing companies to refer potential job candidates and hire foreign workers for occupations that do not have insufficient Canadian workers. Thus far, it looks like the program is working. </span><a href="https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canadian-tech-companies-are-attracting-more-overseas-talent-but-brain-drain-to-u-s-continues"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Financial Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, companies have used it to hire for 3,100 new positions, with more than 2,000 companies applying to hire Talent Stream workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also more regional organizations getting involved. The Vancouver-based </span><a href="http://www.vanhack.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanHack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, has </span><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/careers/career-advice/article-foreign-tech-workers-coming-to-canada-to-fill-talent-gap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped close to 300 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get hired in the last three years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These efforts have boosted recruitment from India, which is the source of the largest group of immigrant tech workers. </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/12/22/indian-technology-talent-is-flocking-to-canada"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Economist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Indians received almost half of the new temporary visas from the Golden Talent Stream. The number of Indians looking for permanent residency also dramatically increased between 2016 and 2017— by 83% for those in a government skills program, 122 percent for those chosen to fill specific vacancies, and by 538 percent for those entering solely on work experience.</span></p>
<h3><strong>International Companies are Investing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the “friendliness” of the US may be in question, Canada continues to lose thousands of highly educated, skilled people to its larger neighbor every year. In fact, the country’s emigration rate to the U.S. has averaged about 0.7 percent of the population since the mid-1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the major reasons behind this “brain drain” have been the higher salaries in the US, and the perceived opportunities for career advancement for those who land a job at an American tech giant. Curiously, these two factors may end up helping the growth of Canada’s tech industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been an explosive growth in Canada when it comes to outside tech giants setting up shop — or expanding their presence — in the northern market. For an example, consider one breathless month in Toronto this past year, when: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft announced they would </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/09/11/microsoft-announces-new-toronto-headquarters-and-570-million-in-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest $570 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into a new, 140,000-square feet headquarters on Bay Street. The company also intends to grow local staff by more than 500 full-time employees, with an additional 500 co-ops and internship positions by 2022.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days later, Uber announced a </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/09/13/uber-expands-canadian-presence-with-200-million-investment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment, which would expand self-driving lab in Toronto, build an engineering lab, and increase their headcount in the city to 500.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same day, Intel announced plans to </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/09/13/intel-to-open-graphics-chip-engineering-lab-in-toronto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open a graphics chip engineering lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week later, Pinterest announced it would be opening its first-ever Canadian office in downtown Toronto. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same week, Instacart revealed it would be expanding its Canadian presence with a new Toronto office and 200 additional employees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not a freak occurrence for Toronto. The city </span><a href="https://www.cbre.com/research-and-reports/Scoring-Tech-Talent-in-North-America-2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">added 82,100 tech jobs between 2012 and 2017 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">– an increase of 50 percent – which is more than any other city in North America. The city also made the top 10 on a ranking of global cities “that have the future-proofing capacity for longer-term success,” and was deemed one of the world’s leading technology innovation hubs by KPMG’s Global Innovation Report.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Toronto got the headlines, tech industry investment in Canada was widespread in 2018. In Vancouver, for example, </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/04/30/amazon-vancouver-tech-hub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon announced plans to expand its Tech Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating 3,000 jobs in e-commerce, cloud computing, and machine learning. Facebook, meanwhile, will be opening a new office in the city, taking over 36,000 square feet in the Waterfront Centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realistically, much of this was down to the cost of operations in Canada. According to the CBRE Group, a 500-employee firm renting a 75,000 square-foot space in Toronto would have estimated one-year operating costs of $30,224,259, with Vancouver and Montreal even cheaper.  The Bay Area, by comparison, had a total estimated cost of $59,124,612.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of why they’re investing in Canada, the presence of tech giants should increase the number of job opportunities, as well as the competition for such roles. This, we hope, will also help increase salaries over time, and the need for greater digital skills. </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Local Scene is Establishing Itself</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coupled with (and boosted by) outside investment, there is a sense that the Canadian tech sector is starting to flex its muscles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rangnekar, for example, cites the success of homegrown e-commerce platform Shopify, an Ottawa-based company with thousands of employees, more than $670 million in revenue, and plans for </span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4878427/ottawa-based-shopify-to-open-tv-film-production-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion into film and television</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People have heard of Shopify everywhere in the world,&#8221; he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify, of course, is not alone: Hootsuite, FreshBooks, Wealthsimple, Wattpad, and Montreal’s Element AI are just a few of the Canadian tech companies making waves on a global level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support these success stories, the Canadian government increased direct funding to industry for innovation, with $434 million in 2018-19, for a total increase of $2.5 billion over five years. The government also announced that the British Columbia-led </span><a href="http://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Technology Supercluster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would receive funding for its Innovation Supercluster Initiative. The Supercluster is expected to create 50,000 new jobs and pump $15 billion in GDP into B.C.’s economy over the next decade.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-toronto-became-a-global-tech-leader-in-7-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto’s rise as a global tech leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 2018 maintained that momentum, with the city’s digital sector continuing to grow at an unprecedented rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the holiday season upon us, we felt it was time to take stock of the year that was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most important Toronto tech industry stories from 2018.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto’s Growing Tech Market Gets Noticed</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CBRE Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a lot of eyebrows this year, releasing a report that underscored the growth of the Toronto tech sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto, the report stated, added 82,100 tech jobs between 2012 and 2017, an increase of 50 percent, which is more than any other city in North America. Toronto also came in fourth in CBRE‘s Tech Talent Scorecard, which looks at a number of metrics, including tech talent supply, completed tech degrees, industry outlook, and more. It was the first time a Canadian city has made the top five (which included the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.).</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7929" style="width: 1918px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7929" class="size-full wp-image-7929" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-9.34.06-AM.png" alt="CBRE Report" width="1908" height="526" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-9.34.06-AM.png 1908w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-9.34.06-AM-300x83.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-9.34.06-AM-768x212.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-9.34.06-AM-1024x282.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-9.34.06-AM-960x265.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1908px) 100vw, 1908px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7929" class="wp-caption-text">CBRE&#8217;s Tech Talent Scorecard | Source: CBRE</p></div></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7931" style="width: 297px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7931" class=" wp-image-7931" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Toby-Lennox-1.jpg" alt="CEO of Toronto Global" width="287" height="306" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Toby-Lennox-1.jpg 460w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Toby-Lennox-1-282x300.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7931" class="wp-caption-text">Toby Lennox | Source: Toronto Global</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Toronto Region has never seen momentum like it’s experiencing right now,” said Toby Lennox, CEO of Toronto Global. “In September alone, the city drew over $1.4 billion in investment from U.S. and Canadian companies, ranging from global tech giants to local startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This momentum shows no sign of slowing down. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the city made the top 10 on a ranking of global cities “that have the future-proofing capacity for longer-term success,” and was deemed one of the world’s leading technology innovation hubs according to KPMG’s latest Global Innovation Report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason for this might have to do with Toronto’s reputation in the AI and blockchain sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the early fundamental technology for AI and blockchain was built by local scientists, developers, and teams, which has given us credibility and attention,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander Norman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Executive Director at Tech Toronto. “There has been a build up for at least 20 years. There have been many small changes over the last decade, which has now made us an emerging hub.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2017 has also played a key role. According to Lennox, it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“put a spotlight on the outstanding quality of globally recognized AI talent that lives right here in the Toronto region. Major international companies are establishing R&amp;D labs in the Toronto region to take advantage of this deep pool of knowledge to develop new commercial applications.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto, believe it or not, is also cheap.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we know. The cost of housing is increasing at an alarming rate. Still, Toronto is one of the cheapest cities for tech firms to operate. CBRE’s study found that a 500-employee firm renting a 75,000 square-foot space in Toronto would have estimated one-year operating costs of $30,224,259. Only Vancouver and Montreal were cheaper. The Bay Area was the most expensive market for tech companies to operate, with a total estimated cost of $59,124,612.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us to…</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tech Giants Move In</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything underscored the growth of the tech market in 2018, it was the number of tech organizations expanding in the 6ix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started in April when The Wing — a New York-based co-working and social space for women — announced that the city would be its first expansion into Canada. Less than two weeks later, Collision Conference, one of North America’s largest startup conferences, announced it would be held in Toronto next year, making it the first time it had left the United States.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7914" style="width: 651px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7914" class="size-full wp-image-7914" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SF-space.jpg" alt="The Wing" width="641" height="653" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SF-space.jpg 641w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/SF-space-294x300.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7914" class="wp-caption-text">Source: The Wing</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following month, Etsy announced plans to open an AI/Machine Learning center, their third “Machine Learning Center of Excellence,” and first in Canada. In a statement, the Brooklyn-based company said it had been &#8220;attracted by Toronto&#8217;s deep pool of world-class machine learning talent, leading universities feeding a robust tech pipeline and vibrant maker culture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an investment point of view, however, Microsoft was probably the most significant development this year. The tech giant announced they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest $570 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into their Canadian operations, with the main focus a new, 140,000-square feet headquarters on Bay Street. The company also intends to grow local staff by more than 500 full-time employees, with an additional 500 co-ops and internship positions by 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two days after this announcement, Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi visited the MaRS Discovery District to announce their own massive investment in Toronto, this time to the tune of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this investment, Uber intends to expand the company’s self-driving lab in Toronto, build an engineering lab, and increase its headcount in the city to 500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Uber, we recognize Canada’s commitment to innovation and the vibrancy of Toronto’s tech ecosystem,” said Khosrowshahi. “We want to support the innovation coming out of this great, diverse region.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Intel announced plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open a graphics chip engineering lab</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the city on the very same day. The new facility will be the main operation center used to design the company’s newest GPUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Toronto] was always on our radar. So when we were going to expand our dreams, we really wanted to tap into this great talent that exists there, ”Ari Rauch, Intel’s VP of Visual Technologies told </span><a href="https://outline.com/NUZ3XC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Globe and Mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a week later, Pinterest announced it would be opening its first-ever Canadian office in downtown Toronto. The social media company also revealed that it had hired former Facebook Canada executive Erin Elofson to lead the operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same week, Instacart revealed it would be expanding its Canadian presence with a new Toronto office and 200 additional employees (who will work across engineering, product, design, research, and development.)</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7916" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7916" class=" wp-image-7916" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/104457258-Apoorva_Mehta_Instacart.600x400.jpg" alt="Apoorva Mehta" width="506" height="337" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/104457258-Apoorva_Mehta_Instacart.600x400.jpg 600w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/104457258-Apoorva_Mehta_Instacart.600x400-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7916" class="wp-caption-text">Apoorva Mehta, Founder, and CEO of Instacart | Source: Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a Canadian and alumni of the University of Waterloo engineering school, I’m proud to see Canada, and Toronto in particular, grow to become one of the most influential tech hubs in North America,” </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/09/26/instacart-announces-new-toronto-tech-hub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apoorva Mehta, CEO of Instacart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was a student at Waterloo, the perception was that you had to leave Toronto and head to Silicon Valley to make an impact in tech. Today, that’s no longer the case, as Toronto has quickly become one of the hottest tech markets in the world. The innovation and talent coming out of Canada are world-class and Instacart is excited to invest in this growing community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart had a busy 2018, as it turns out, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">having also acquired Toronto’s Unata</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of Canada’s fastest-growing companies, in January. They also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a grocery-delivery partnership</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Loblaw, the country’s largest grocer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day after Instacart’s announcement, WeWork launched WeWork Labs in Toronto, its first Lab in Canada. WeWork Labs provides early-stage startups with space and resources, including ‘Startup 101’ workshops. WeWork currently has Labs in 12 cities, including New York, Washington, DC, Shanghai, and São Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two days later, Shopify announced a $500 million expansion of its Toronto presence. The Ottawa-based company currently has 700 employees in the city, across three offices, and the new plan involves occupying 254,000 square feet at The Well development on Front Street, one of the largest construction projects in Canada.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7918" style="width: 1110px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7918" class="size-full wp-image-7918" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arial1100x360.jpg" alt="The Well Development" width="1100" height="360" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arial1100x360.jpg 1100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arial1100x360-300x98.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arial1100x360-768x251.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arial1100x360-1024x335.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Arial1100x360-960x314.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7918" class="wp-caption-text">The Well Development | Source: The Well Toronto</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this was capped off in November when professional services firm Accenture opened an innovation hub in the city, with plans to add 300 jobs within the Toronto hub, and another 100 elsewhere in the city. Accenture also plans to add 100 apprenticeship jobs, dedicated to underrepresented groups including Indigenous youth and people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the then still-undecided Amazon decision as a backdrop, this stream of announcements signaled that something in Toronto had changed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a one-off. It’s a pattern where large companies are increasingly seeing the need to invest in technology as a means of staying competitive [and] coming to Toronto,” said Sean Mullin, Executive Director of the Brookfield Institute for innovation and entrepreneurship at Ryerson University, explaining that Toronto’s presence on Amazon’s shortlist really drove home </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the city’s new status.</span></p>
<p>According to <span style="font-weight: 400;">Krista Jones, Managing Director of Enterprise at MaRS Discovery District, it&#8217;s a been a bit of a perfect storm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re starting to see a pull from the global world in, where we used to have to push out,” she said.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Money Keeps Coming In</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was also a big year on the funding and acquisitions front. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail AI company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubikloud Technologies Inc., for example,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $37 million in a Series B financing round. The round was led by Intel Capital with iNovia Capital, OTEAF, Horizons Ventures, and Access Industries also participating. Rubikloud plans to expand into Europe and Asia to meet the demand for retail AI solutions in the global market.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7920" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7920" class="size-full wp-image-7920" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mainnav_ecobee4_us.png" alt="ecobee smart thermostat" width="220" height="160" /><p id="caption-attachment-7920" class="wp-caption-text">Ecobee smart thermostat | Source: Ecobee</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, smart thermostat company Ecobee raised $36 million in 2018, bringing its total Series C funding to just over $94 million (USD). The latest round included participation from the Amazon Alexa Fund, and for good reason: the funding will allow the company to keep up with its rival Nest, the smart home company purchased by Google in 2014. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.touchbistro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TouchBistro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an iPad POS built to streamline restaurant operations, announced it had raised $72 million in Series D financing. The round was led by OMERS Ventures and JPMorgan Chase, with participation from Napier Park Financial Partners, Recruit Holdings Co, Ltd, BDC IT Venture Fund, and Relay Ventures. This round brought TouchBistro’s total funding to date $117 million (CAD).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ritual Technologies Inc., an online ordering service, raised $70-million in financing led by Canadian venture capital firm Georgian Partners. Georgian’s investment is first Canadian funding for the company, which has raised $57.5-million in previous financing rounds from U.S. VC funds Greylock and Insight Ventures.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7928" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7928" class=" wp-image-7928" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ritual-Cofounders5_336455.jpg" alt="Ritual Cofounders" width="470" height="218" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ritual-Cofounders5_336455.jpg 970w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ritual-Cofounders5_336455-300x139.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ritual-Cofounders5_336455-768x356.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ritual-Cofounders5_336455-960x445.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7928" class="wp-caption-text">Ritual co-founders | Source: Inc.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the financing, Ritual is aiming to expand into Europe and Asia, and increase its North American presence. The company’s goals are ambitious: it wants to be in the top 25 cities in all three continents within five years. To get there, it plans to double its 150-person staff by next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the acquisitions front, the year began with news that Visual China Group had acquired 500px, one of the leading online visual creative communities in the world. Since its founding in 2009, 500px has grown to include more than 13 million professionals and amateur photographers from over 195 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few months later, McAfee announced that it had acquired VPN provider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TunnelBear</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The security giant intends to integrate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TunnelBear’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technologies into the company’s own VPN product, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safe Connect</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time, L’Oreal announced it had acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modiface</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an augmented reality beauty company that has helped create apps for companies like Sephora, Estée Lauder, and L&#8217;Oreal itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just a week ago, Nasdaq completed the acquisition of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quandl</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of alternative and core financial data. Quandl’s platform will be combined with Nasdaq’s existing Analytics Hub business within Global Information Services. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Organizations Build Stronger Foundations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this activity on the financial side was matched by a number of initiatives that should encourage local innovation. First, the much-maligned Bombardier agreed to set up an aerospace hub in Downsview Park with the Downsview Aerospace Innovation and Research Consortium (DAIR).</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7927" style="width: 1009px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7927" class="wp-image-7927 " src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DAIR-1280x701.jpg" alt="" width="999" height="547" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DAIR-1280x701.jpg 1280w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DAIR-1280x701-300x164.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DAIR-1280x701-768x421.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DAIR-1280x701-1024x561.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DAIR-1280x701-960x526.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7927" class="wp-caption-text">Rendering of DAIR | Source: Techvibes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bombardier has committed to invest $4.5 million, which will go towards academic opportunities and operational costs, including the preservation of aerospace heritage at the site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through this partnership with Bombardier, DAIR will be uniquely positioned to play a leading role in the development of tomorrow’s aviation solutions,” said Andrew Petrou, Executive Director for DAIR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two months later, the University of Toronto revealed plans for a new, 14-story tower, 250,000-square-foot innovation center. Located across the street from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MaRS Discovery District</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new space will eventually house the aforementioned Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_7913" style="width: 1088px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7913" class="wp-image-7913 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U-of-T-plans-to-build-new-innovation-centre-to-house-the-Vector-Institute-Source-University-of-Toronto-.png" alt="U of T Innovation Centre" width="1078" height="566" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U-of-T-plans-to-build-new-innovation-centre-to-house-the-Vector-Institute-Source-University-of-Toronto-.png 1078w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U-of-T-plans-to-build-new-innovation-centre-to-house-the-Vector-Institute-Source-University-of-Toronto--300x158.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U-of-T-plans-to-build-new-innovation-centre-to-house-the-Vector-Institute-Source-University-of-Toronto--768x403.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U-of-T-plans-to-build-new-innovation-centre-to-house-the-Vector-Institute-Source-University-of-Toronto--1024x538.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/U-of-T-plans-to-build-new-innovation-centre-to-house-the-Vector-Institute-Source-University-of-Toronto--960x504.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1078px) 100vw, 1078px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7913" class="wp-caption-text">U of T Innovation Centre | Source: University of Toronto</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Toronto also announced a five-year, multimillion-dollar research partnership with LG. The partnership includes the development of a research center in the city, which will aim to solve fundamental problems surrounding deep learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, Artscape Daniels Launchpad, a hub for creative entrepreneurship, opened in November on the waterfront. The non-profit organization aims to provide makers, visual artists, media creators, and designers with a creative space that supports experimentation, connection, and collaboration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help these local professionals and creatives, BrainStation offered a number of new </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/courses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">certificate courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, including Design Thinking, Digital Marketing, Agile, and Google Analytics, among many others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also launched the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science Diploma Program,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first full-time data science diploma program of its kind in Canada, and hosted a range of </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/events/toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keynotes and panel discussions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with industry leaders from across the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the last few years, our campus has become a unique community gathering point, and much like Toronto’s burgeoning tech scene, we feel the best is yet to come.</span></p>
