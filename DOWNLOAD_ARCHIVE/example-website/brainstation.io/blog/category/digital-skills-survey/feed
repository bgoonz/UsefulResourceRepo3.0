								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second annual </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2020-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polled thousands of tech professionals on their lives at work, their most-used tools, their professional development efforts, and their predictions for the future – and across all disciplines, one thing was made extremely clear: ongoing digital skills training is the new secret to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aiming to provide critical insights into the mindset of tech workers while also ensuring organizations are properly allocating learning, development and upskilling resources, BrainStation’s survey found that respondents in all six disciplines surveyed – data, development, design, marketing, product management, and executive – overwhelmingly felt their organizations would achieve more success with a more digitally savvy workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s encouraging, then, that BrainStation’s survey found employers were anticipating this need, with 42 percent of executives reporting that their organizations had already implemented digital skills training initiatives, and another 19 percent pledging plans to offer that training in the future. That commitment to continuing education is certainly a positive thing, considering the World Economic Forum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than half (54 percent) of all employees will require significant reskilling by 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That couldn’t happen soon enough, particularly since BrainStation’s survey found that organizations are increasingly bolstering their digital strategy. Among corporate executives polled, 92 percent reported that digital transformation was a top strategic business priority, with 74 percent having already taken steps in that direction and another 18 percent planning to do so over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, it seems skills training will be a crucial element in that process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 2020 Digital Skills Survey findings really make clear that professionals now understand that, in order to keep pace with the rapid rate of change in technology, continuously upgrading their skills is a necessity,” said Jason Field, Founder and CEO, BrainStation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our survey also highlights an increasing focus on cross-discipline learning as tech professionals and employers alike are placing a priority on more broad, well-rounded skill sets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to take a closer look at each of the six disciplines surveyed to see which digital skills were in high demand and low supply.</span></p>
<h2><b>Data</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an exaggeration to say that the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence has irrevocably transformed pretty much every industry there is, from </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-changing-the-future-of-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-big-data-has-transformed-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional sports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-data-is-being-used-in-restaurants-and-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-being-used-to-make-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">art</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/4-major-industries-are-being-revolutionized-by-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beyond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Demand for Data Scientists is forecast to rise by 28 percent by next year, creating an additional 2.7 million jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not surprising, then, that there’s a rapidly growing appetite for data skill training in pretty much every discipline and industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a look at the big picture, 83 percent of respondents to BrainStation’s survey ranked the data literacy in their organizations as lagging, while 89 percent said that dearth of data literacy was having an effect on the success of their organization’s projects, and 59 percent said their organizations would be more successful if employees had better data skills. If that last number seems low, it might indicate that even more progress will need to be made transitioning more organizations into a data-first mindset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of their own data teams, 48.2 percent of data professionals ranked the overall level of data literacy within their companies as “basic,” while only 17.3 percent reported a data literacy level of advanced or expert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 74.8 percent of data professionals felt that digital skills training would make them more effective in their roles – and 55.6 percent of those professionals specifically wanted more data training (meanwhile, 15.7 percent felt they would benefit from learning about development, 12 percent wanted to learn more about design, and 9.3 percent wanted more digital marketing training).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digging deeper, it makes sense that data professionals want to upgrade their data skills. Looking to the next five to 10 years, 78 percent of data respondents predicted that artificial intelligence would have the most impact followed by machine learning (70 percent), but a majority of data respondents – 63 percent – said they don’t currently work with AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, data professionals are typically now expected to be comfortable using a wide variety of statistical and machine learning techniques – linear regression being the most popular, with 55 percent familiarity among respondents – and yet 35 percent of those surveyed had never used any of those techniques at all, showing a clear need for further upskilling in that area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With demand for data skills soaring, BrainStation’s survey also made it clear that many are changing careers to take advantage. According to the survey, 76 percent of data scientists who responded did not begin their career in data, and 68 percent have been working in the field for five years or less.</span><b> </b></p>
<h2><b>Web Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area poised for rapid growth – the U.S. Bureau of Labor is forecasting this job market will grow by 15 percent by 2026 – the fields of mobile and web development are changing so rapidly that, again, Developers must continue to educate themselves to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 80 percent of Web Developers reported that digital skills training would make them more successful, with 52 percent looking for additional development skills, 20 percent focused on data and 12 percent focused on design. Interestingly, 30 percent of Developers reported that additional development skills would boost their organizations, while 21 percent chose data. Also relating to data, 86 and 84 percent of Developers felt that AI and machine learning respectively would have the most impact on their field in the coming years, yet only 17 percent have worked with any AI platforms or blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, we have recently looked at how Developers can benefit from acquiring </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/3-reasons-why-developers-make-great-data-scientists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and design skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is by far the most popular programming language among the Developers polled – 75 percent reported using it regularly – while SQL continues to climb in popularity to 47 percent, highlighting another potential upskilling opportunity for much of the Development workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development is another field where transplants are driving in droves – 54 percent reported beginning their careers in a different field. Still, executives reported a difficult time finding Developers with all the necessary skills in their toolkit; although they reported that they would be doing the most hiring in development (41 percent), 39 percent said that it was the most difficult area to hire for.</span></p>
<h2><b>Design</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often said that user experience (UX) design is a field that requires several different </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-skills-does-a-ux-designer-need" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">types of skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at once – including technical tools, business know-how, and transferable personal skills such as empathy and communication – so it’s not surprising how many UX Designers are committed to continuous learning; 79 percent of Designers surveyed reported that they would be more successful with additional digital skills training (such as <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design?utm_source=BNSTNBlog&amp;utm_medium=BlostPost&amp;utm_campaign=course_SkillsSecretToSuccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX design courses</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Designers want to polish their skills in design (34 percent) and product management (23 percent). They’d like to see a little more overall design literacy within their organizations, pointing to a need for those in other disciplines to understand more about user-centric design; nearly 77 percent reported their company’s design literacy was either basic or intermediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the results, it’s clear to see which competencies specifically are lacking. Although 74.4 percent of UX Designers polled design for web, only 37.2 percent report working on native mobile. Even more problematic? Only 5.6 percent have designed for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, while only 14 percent have worked with voice-based interfaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That suggests a workforce-wide need to modernize and upgrade skills.</span></p>
<h2><b>Marketing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent sea change in marketing – as the spend on digital has finally surpassed traditional advertising channels – this is a field where digital skills are becoming a major differentiator for tech talent, and perhaps even a game-changer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-marketers-need-to-focus-on-digital-skills-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, research from Burning Glass Technologies shows that four in 10 marketing job openings now call for digital marketing skills, with the number of postings calling for digital skills almost doubling between 2011 and 2016. Digital marketing roles grew 30 percent faster over that period than overall marketing postings (while also taking 16 percent longer to fill), and digital marketing skills carried nearly a $7,000 salary premium over other marketing postings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, another study carried out by Target Internet with the Chartered Institute of Marketing painted a portentous picture of the digital skills gap in marketing, as a group of marketers tested on skill areas including data, content marketing, digital strategy, SEO, social media marketing, and usability produced dismal scores (the marketers couldn’t surpass a 36 percent score in any one topic).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hardly surprising, then, that 89 percent of marketers polled by BrainStation said digital skills training would make them perform better in their role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly – and unlike most of the other fields explored here – marketers want more than anything to build out their multi-disciplinary skillset, with 33.6 percent said their company should focus on data skill training, and 31.5 percent saying that further marketing training was a top priority. And 78 percent reported that there was room for improvement in their organization’s marketing literacy.</span></p>
<p>Feel the same way? Find out more about BrainStation&#8217;s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/digital-marketing?utm_source=BNSTNBlog&amp;utm_medium=BlostPost&amp;utm_campaign=course_SkillsSecretToSuccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing courses</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Product Management</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “mini-CEOs” of a product, Product Managers are often expected to be jack-of-all-trade types with broad skill sets that incorporate any number of specializations. They’re handsomely rewarded for that – Hired’s 2017 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global State of Tech Salaries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survey found that Product Managers’ average salary of $138,000 was the very highest of any tech role, while LinkedIn lists the role as one of its </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/product-manager-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most promising jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – but clearly, Product Managers can’t afford to be complacent where skill training is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 78 percent of product management respondents felt that digital skills training would make them more effective. Reflecting on the multi-disciplinary demands of their position, those surveyed were split on what kind of training would be most beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it seems like Product Managers want to learn more about everything related to tech: 31.7 percent want more data training, 24.6 percent want to invest further in product skills, 19 percent are interested in boosting their development toolkit, while 13.4 percent have an interest in boosting their marketing skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, AR and VR represent significant skill deficits within the product sphere – a massive 88 percent have never been involved with either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s encouraging news for anyone eyeing a career in Product Management; 86 percent of those surveyed started their careers in a different field. Clearly, they already know a thing or two about upskilling. </span></p>
<h2><b>Executive</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, Executives are overwhelmingly committed to bringing digital transformation to their organizations; in fact, 82 percent said that their digital investments were growing or stable (and only 4.9 percent said they were shrinking), while 92 percent plan to increase their digital transformation activities in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, digital transformations often fail; a McKinsey report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that only 16 percent of respondents said their digital transformations successfully improved performance and equipped them to sustain changes in the long term. McKinsey’s report also found that organizations that offered skill and leadership development opportunities were nearly twice as likely to succeed in those digital transformations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s heartening, then, that beyond efforts to educate their employees, 72 percent of executives also feel that they too would benefit from digital skills training. Particularly, they’re focused on data (35 percent) and marketing (26 percent). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, by looking at the areas in which executives expect to invest the most money and resources, we can get further clues about the optimal areas of skill-building and development for the tech workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, digital marketing skills certainly appear to be in high demand. Executives reported investing in SEO (57 percent), email marketing (56 percent), content marketing (55 percent) and organic social media (52 percent). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, again, it seems tech professionals of all stripes would be well-served by learning more about AI and machine learning – executives expect to invest in both in 2020, at a rate of 45 percent and 38.9 percent respectively.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation recently surveyed thousands of professionals and industry leaders to better understand their day-to-day experience and to spot trends and shifts in the digital sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re happy to announce that the results of the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2020-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Digital Skills Survey are now live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Skills Survey covered six professional disciplines and functions:</span><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7421" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-1024x289.gif" alt="Digital Skills Survey disciplines" width="1024" height="289" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-1024x289.gif 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-300x85.gif 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-768x217.gif 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-960x271.gif 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were then broken down further into four areas:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills and tools</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future trends</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some highlights of the overall findings.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Transformation is Happening </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written quite a bit about digital transformation as an urgent need for organizations around the world, and the survey results confirmed that this is a top strategic business priority. 74 percent of executives, in fact, claimed that their company was already undertaking digital transformation initiatives, and a further 18 percent claimed that they would also be increasing their digital investments and initiatives in the year ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To emphasize this even further,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">80 percent of respondents said that there were new elements of their products and services today that did not exist a mere five years ago. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Skills Training is Now Required </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey results proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that professionals now view digital skills training as a professional necessity across all functions and levels. Respondents in every field felt that additional skills training would make them more successful in their current roles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 percent of Web Developers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent of Designers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent of Marketers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78 percent of Product Managers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75 percent of Data professionals </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting is that</span><b> 72 percent of Executives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also said that additional training would improve their performance, which indicates that a desire and a need for digital skills and experience is being felt across organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents wanted to continue learning within their field, but there was also a strong demand for cross-discipline learning, which illustrates the need and importance of much broader skill sets. Respondents in all fields, for example, said that data skills would be the skill that would most help them be more successful in their role. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations Are Upskilling</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a surprise that executives we surveyed said that development was the area where they planned to do the most hiring this year (with marketing not far behind). 43 percent said they planned plan to look externally to meet these hiring needs. However, upskilling and reskilling is clearly on the rise. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10529" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-1024x429.png" alt="Where will you do the most hiring?" width="1024" height="429" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-1024x429.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-300x126.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-768x322.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-960x403.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM.png 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey results, 42 percent said of Executives said their organizations have already implemented digital skills training initiatives and 19 percent said they’d be implementing it in the future. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reskilling is now cheaper than hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we expect this to increase in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionals Have to Keep Up With New Digital Tools</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, of course, many programming languages out there, but for the second year in a row, JavaScript is by far the most widely used language. 75 percent of respondents said that they used it regularly. The next most popular was SQL at 47 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the data front, Excel is the most widely used analysis tool, although only 66 percent of respondents are using it the most (compared with 81 percent in 2019). What the results show, however, is that Data Scientists (as opposed to data or business analysts) use a broader range of tools than the other data roles, including Python. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics is the most widely used campaign measurement tool, with a massive 82 percent of marketing respondents saying they use it to track performance. However, what’s even more interesting here is that more than 80 percent have also used Excel or custom-built solutions, which would suggest that the off-the-shelf software solutions are maybe not getting the job done. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And when it comes to the tools of the design trade, InVision and Sketch are the most popular tools currently being used by Designers for the second year in a row. Illustrator, Photoshop, and Adobe XD were also cited for wireframing, which highlights the varied skillsets and technical capabilities required in the field. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other important thing to consider here: InVision was only launched nine years. Marvel, Framer, Principle, are also all relatively new companies and software platforms – the design field, clearly, is changing very rapidly, and professionals need to stay on top of changing tools.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Landscape is Changing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram was cited as the most effective platform for social media marketing, with 67 percent of respondents preferring it. Facebook came out on top last year, which would suggest that Instagram is growing in importance for marketers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of LinkedIn is also worth keeping an eye on. The professional network came in third this year, behind Facebook and Instagram, but it leapfrogged Twitter and grew the most out of any platform cited in the survey. This may indicate that LinkedIn may soon be playing a much bigger role in marketing initiatives in 2020 and beyond. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities Abound in Emerging Roles</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 Digital Skills Survey results make it clear that the majority of professionals taking advantage of the demand in emerging roles did not start their careers in those fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">86 percent of Product Managers, for example, did not start their careers in product management or product development. Data is another great example, as a remarkable 76 percent of data respondents did not begin their career in data, and in fact, 68 percent have only been working in the discipline for five years or less. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10528" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM-1024x331.png" alt="Career progression in tech" width="1024" height="331" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM-1024x331.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM-300x97.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM-768x249.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM-960x311.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-4.12.22-PM.png 2342w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers prove that re-skilling is happening on a grand scale. It also shows that opportunities really do exist for those looking to transition into an emerging field.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s it like to be a Designer in 2019? While the answer will be different for everyone, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/brainstation-releases-results-from-2019-digital-skills-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstation’s Digital Skills Survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">reveals some surprisingly strong trends—and sheds some light on the day-in, day-out of a typical Designer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you’re wondering if you’d be a good fit for the role. With roughly 75 percent of Managers indicating plans to double the number of <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Designers</a> on their teams over the next five years, there’s never been a better time to brush up your skills and make the leap.</span></p>

</div>
<h3><b>How to Start in UX Design</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what does a Designer do, exactly? The lion’s share of their work ends up online, with an overwhelming 84 percent of our respondents saying they designed primarily for the web. We asked Kyle Deming, a web strategist at </span><a href="https://wojodesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wojo Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Chicago, what drives this focality. “We view web design as different and distinct enough that it’s more important for us to concentrate on being great web Designers, rather than to branch out and try to do everything.” In other words, designing a great website is a field unto itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the surprises in BrainStation’s survey data was just how attached Designers get to their role: design was the only field in which a majority of respondents (63 percent) began their careers. Maybe it’s because Designers love their work too much to ever leave it, or maybe it’s because the work is so challenging, only someone who truly loves it would stick with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deming, who has been working in web design since co-founding his firm as a high school senior 15 years ago, suggests another possibility. “It’s an industry that you can break into very early and very young, doing things on your own—building your own websites and so on—and experiment even before you get into the workforce.” Perhaps it’s this ability to test the waters that lets people know if design is their calling right from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps it’s the camaraderie. More than three-quarters of Designers work in small teams of 10 people or less—and almost half work in teams of five or less. Whatever the reason, it seems that Designers are especially attached to their work.</span></p>
<h3><b>Research is Fundamental to the Design Process</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our survey asked Designers which phases of the design process they personally had a hand in, including research, ideation, wireframing, prototyping, design building and, finally, user testing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, design </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">per se</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the area most respondents—92 percent—said they routinely work on. “Design is the meat of what we do,” Deming says, “where the actual project gets done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first comes research—a phase 57 percent of respondents said they participate in. “A lot of the time, research is done at the proposal preparation phase,” says Deming. “Research is about 10 percent of the work we do, and probably half of that is done before we officially begin working on a project. It takes a good research foundation to do a good proposal.”</span></p>
<h3><b>What Designers Use for Ideation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After design, ideation is the phase Designers participate in most frequently (75 percent). “Ideation is where we think at a very broad level,” Deming says, “so things continue to evolve pretty substantially as we go through the process. The thing you get at the end might not look anything like what you started with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because ideation is such an open, freewheeling process, Designers are quite split on how they like to do it; ultimately, it comes down to finding the methods they’re most comfortable with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all Designers rely on old-school tools at some point—88 percent still use pen and paper, and 58 percent hold whiteboarding sessions—but a large majority (72 percent) incorporate digital tools as well, and fully one-third use a more structured methodology, such as design sprints.</span></p>
<h3><b>Wireframing and Prototyping</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If ideation is throwing everything at the wall, wireframing and prototyping are how Designers see what sticks. A small majority of respondents are routinely involved at this stage, where the ideation phase’s outcomes are refined: 58 percent in wireframing and 57 percent in prototyping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wireframing is very critical to our design process,” Deming says, “because it helps provide a structure for the website. Once you have a really solid outline or framework, applying great design to it becomes fairly straightforward.” Using wireframes, as opposed to a fully prototyped site design, “allows us to iterate pretty quickly,” he says, “and to make sure everybody on the project is happy with the direction we’re headed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some clear favorites when it comes to wireframing tools: Sketch (66 percent) and Illustrator (44 percent) are the pack leaders, with Invision Studio (25 percent), Adobe XD (19 percent), Axure (9 percent), Figma (8 percent), and Marvel (5 percent) rounding out the list.</span></p>
<h3><b>What Design Tools do Designers Use Most?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the design phase, respondents’ tool preferences followed a similar pattern, with Sketch (64 percent) and Photoshop (43 percent) on top. Adobe XD (21 percent), Invision Studio (17 percent), Figma (9 percent), Framer (5 percent), and Marvel (3 percent) also held steady.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Advance Your Design Career</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While anyone can begin playing around with web design, Deming advises aspiring pros to develop a wide base of software and design knowledge before entering the workforce. “You need to have a basic knowledge of Photoshop; hopefully you also have knowledge of Sketch, and some other tools as well,” he says. “A number of different tools are used over the course of a project, and if you’re trying to learn that all on the job, that can be tricky. We really love it when potential employees come to us with experience across multiple different toolsets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as important are the softer design skills. “There can be a bit too much focus on just making things that look pretty, without thinking about how things function,” he says. “Designers should have an understanding of color theory, but also of how the sizing of elements matters to focus and comprehension, and so forth. At the end of the day, the site also needs to be high-functioning.”</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While getting into design can be easy, climbing the ranks from beginner to intermediate to senior Designer can be more difficult. Deming points to the pattern identified above—where almost all Designers work on the design phase, but fewer are involved in ideation, and fewer still in the crucial steps of wireframing and prototyping. “I mentioned how pivotal the early stages of a project are,” he says. “Improving your ability to use your research and ideation skills is important to moving ahead.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond exerting more influence over the crucial early stages of the process, intermediate Designers can set themselves apart by honing the kinds of specialized skills that take a perfectly decent design and turn it into something truly eye-catching. “Having those extra elements—animation, interactivity—can really bring things to the next level,” Deming says. “That’s becoming increasingly important.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toward the end of 2018, BrainStation surveyed a wide range of professionals and industry leaders to better understand their day-to-day experience, and to spot trends and shifts in the digital sector. Mission accomplished on both fronts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll look at some key findings from each discipline below, but you can </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click here to see the full report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Skills Survey covered six professional disciplines and functions:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7421 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5.gif" alt="Digital Skills Survey" width="1200" height="339" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were then broken down further into four areas:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills and tools</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future trends</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were some general findings that were consistent across all disciplines: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of digital professionals are working in small teams (fewer than 10). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jira and Trello were the most popular project management platforms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack and email remain the most popular forms of workplace communication.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hootsuite is the most commonly used tool for social media management.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s take a closer look at some of the key findings within each discipline: </span></p>
