								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We&#8217;ve written about the ways data is impacting the world, including its effect on <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-big-data-has-transformed-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sports&nbsp;</a>(including the&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-data-played-a-role-in-the-toronto-raptors-nba-championship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raptor’s first NBA championship win</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/using-data-to-drive-community-at-lululemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community building</a>, and greater&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-organizations-are-using-data-for-social-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">societal change.</a></p>



<p>There&#8217;s evidence that this is only the beginning.&nbsp;According to Dresner Advisory Services, data science adoption in enterprises has increased from 17 percent to 59 percent.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s not enough to convince you data skills are important, here are a few more reasons<span style="font-weight: 400;"> why a Data Analytics certification is worth taking.</span></p>



<h2><strong>Demand for Data Analytics Skills is High</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, there has never been a better time to be a data professional.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created daily and that pace is only quickening. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Data Corporation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s 2017 forecast predicted that revenues for big data and business analytics would reach $150.8 billion worldwide, a 12.4 percent increase over 2016. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its 2017 report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quant Crunch: How the Demand for Data Science Skills is Disrupting the Job Market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, IBM predicted that the number of jobs for U.S. data professionals would grow from 364,000 to 2,720,000 by 2020.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the study found that jobs in data analytics and data science remain open five days longer than average, that demand for data professionals is projected to grow 39 percent, and that the fastest-growing roles in this sphere are data scientists and advanced analysts.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently took a closer look at some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/4-top-data-science-jobs-explained">most in-demand data science jobs,&nbsp;</a></span>which can help provide a better understanding of the opportunities available.</p>



<h2>Employers Want Up-to-date Data Training</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of big data has changed at such a breakneck pace, most employers are not just prioritizing the quality of a candidate’s training, but also how recently it was attained.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IT research firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foote Partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, d</span>ata&nbsp;skills and certifications have increased in value every quarter for the past two years.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">That aligns with what hiring experts are hearing from companies looking to hire data professionals.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any time would be a good time to get a data analytics certification. It shows a potential employer a bona fide level of interest in the industry and the skill set, and as well, continued education demonstrates work ethic and commitment,”&nbsp;said Shaun Lemmer, Partner and Consultant at Benchmark Tech Recruitment.</span></p>



<h2><strong>Technical Competency Determines Compensation</strong></h2>



<p>Salaries for data roles already compare favorably to other careers in tech, with average annual compensation averaging around $99,558. There is evidence that even if you&#8217;re in this field already, boosting your skillset could bump your salary further.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IBM’s report, professionals with experience using Hadoop, for example, are in the market for jobs that average over $110,000 per year.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If someone is retooling and considering a career change, getting a certification would be paramount to opening up doors,” Lemmer said.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to IBM, it could be a lot of doors. Their report noted that if its forecast supply of 2.8 million “analytically savvy” workers turns out to be correct, nearly every one of those workers would have to change jobs annually to fill the required data analytics and data science positions.</span></p>



<p>BrainStation&#8217;s data certificate courses were created to help professionals take advantage of these opportunities, allowing them to gain hands-on experience uncovering new insights from data sets, making data-driven predictions, and generating striking data visualization.</p>

Popularity aside, Python is also relatively easy to learn, making it a great option if you’re interested in breaking into the data field but don’t have much experience with object-oriented programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BlogPost&amp;utm_campaign=datacertificates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python Programming</a> training will give you a fundamental understanding of Python, which in turn enables you to learn more complex machine learning and data science concepts moving forward.</span></p>

<p><b>What You’ll Learn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: How to effectively analyze data using industry tools including Tableau, Excel, and SQL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s organizations, there is a need for increased data skills across all departments. In fact, The Digital Skills Survey found that&nbsp;<span class="highlight-number">83 percent</span>&nbsp;of respondents ranked the data literacy in their organization as intermediate or low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-analytics?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BlogPost&amp;utm_campaign=datacertificates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Analytics certificate</a> will teach you how to work with data more efficiently, using tools like Tableau, Excel, MAMP, and more.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgina Gow takes professional development seriously – tuning into BrainStation’s Tuesday evening <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Live UX Design</a> class on what is her Wednesday morning in Australia. This is the second certificate course Georgina has taken at BrainStation after discovering the digital skills training while in Toronto on holiday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke with Georgina to hear about her experience taking an Online Live course, how she manages the time difference, and how the courses have helped her in her multiple professional roles. </span></p>

<h3><b>Can you tell us a bit about your education and career background?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I graduated in 2015 from the University of Tasmania with a Bachelor of Business and a double major in Marketing and Management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My career kick-started prior to graduating when I was fortunate enough to obtain a role at a local council as the marketing and events coordinator for the now-iconic Blue Derby Mountain Bike Trails. It was this job that led me to my next adventure at a design school (Foundry) working in their marketing department and as a social media course writer and teacher for two years.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to today where I work full-time as a Digital Specialist at St.LukesHealth, a Health Insurance company that offers insurance Australia-wide, manage the online presence for the Blue Derby Mountain Bike Trails, and teach Social Media at Foundry – I’m not too good at letting go of my jobs!</span></p>
<h3><b>You have taken both Online Live Data Analytics and User Experience Design with BrainStation, what motivated you to take these courses?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always had a keen interest in UX and Data, which came about in two ways:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) The motivation to be better at my job and have the ability to go one step further in marketing, by ensuring the online journey is as pleasant as possible and having the ability to communicate better with designers and web developers to achieve the best outcome for the user.</span></p>
<p>2) At Foundry, we had a lot of iconic Australian speakers who are prolific in design, data and so much more. In particular, one conference focused on data-driven design, and I was fascinated with the topic and how it influenced so many different things in the workplace.</p>
<h3><b>You live in Australia, what influenced your decision to take the BrainStation Online Live courses in a different time zone?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was actually in Toronto taking a mini working holiday and wanted to upskill while I had the downtime. I then went back to Australia a little earlier than I’d planned, but I was determined to still study with BrainStation as they were the first courses I had found that were directly relevant to the outcomes I wanted to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the time zone is only an issue if you aren’t committed or passionate enough about the topics and don’t have a flexible workplace. I was fortunate enough that St.LukesHealth is so passionate about the development of employees that I’m able to study during work hours and take time where necessary. </span></p>
<h3><b>Can you describe your Online Live learning experience? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoy the Online Live learning experience because it’s being taught live. It’s also fascinating to me hearing my fellow students talk about their experiences in their different professional working lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highlight is definitely the Instructors, who all have relevant industry experience at well-known companies that directly relate to the content. </span></p>
<h3><b>Did the Online Live experience at BrainStation differ from what you had previously associated with online learning? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 percent. Previously, my online courses at university consisted of lecture slides and an online recorded lecture. The online live classes are extremely beneficial as they’re in real-time, there’s an engaging Instructor, and other students are all there because they want to be. </span></p>
<h3><b>What were some of the most valuable skills you gained during the DA and UX courses? Have these courses aided your professional development?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have found these courses so valuable in different ways, Data Analytics has taught me the importance of breaking down a question to solve the problem and also how to segment audiences in a more efficient way, developing tailored content that is relevant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UX course has allowed me to build on the knowledge I already had and expand my thought process in relation to user testing and best practices for marketing experiences. </span></p>

<h3><b>As a Digital Specialist at St.LukesHealth, what does a typical day look like for you?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to describe a typical day as it varies depending on the week, but a typical day could include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planning</strong> – campaign planning for the month, web updates, content planning for online channels, and reevaluating the online user journeys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Producing</strong> – the creation of digital media for our online channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Training</strong> – ensuring I am up to date in all areas of digital and working to best practices and standards.</span></p>
<h3><b>How have you incorporated the skills you learned in Data Analytics and UX Design into your role?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Analytics</a> has allowed me to see the bigger picture when it comes to our member base and the ability to break down different areas of target audiences and find out the best approach with targeting and tailoring content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m currently in the User Experience Design course, but the most exciting thing for me has been the development of online personas and taking the next step with regards to understanding the needs of our members and potential members.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Ali Mahmood, Senior Analyst, Data Insights &amp; Analytics for Loblaw Companies Limited and a graduate of BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science Diploma Program</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We chatted with Ali about his experience in the diploma program and how it led him to his current role in data.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-2.jpg" alt="Data Science student" class="wp-image-9779" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-2.jpg 200w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-2-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0-2-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></figure></div>



<p><b>BrainStation: Can you tell us a bit about your education and career background before BrainStation?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ali: My background is quite unique. I studied a double major in Chemistry and Biology at the University of Toronto before pursuing a postgraduate Bioinformatics program. In the months between completing that program and starting my career in data I worked on a full stack development project as well.</span></p>



<p><b>What was your motivation to take the Data Science Program? What factors influenced your decision?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a continuous learner and strongly believe in constant upskilling. Technology is advancing at such an incredible rate that falling behind on this education will leave you fighting to get back on the ladder. Being someone who likes to learn across various subject areas, pursuing a career in data science came rather naturally to me since it&#8217;s a profession that can be applied to everything.</span></p>



<p><b>Tell us about your learning experience at BrainStation.</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The learning environment was very warming and encouraging. It was a pleasure coming to class and learning from instructors who had valuable and relevant experience. I went home every day having learned something new and beneficial. The work around, and including, Demo Day was definitely a top highlight for me since I could display work done on a project I felt passionate about – while learning about other projects that my fellow students had worked hard on as well.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What were some of the most valuable skills you gained during the program?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most valuable skills were definitely the specific technical skills you would expect to learn coming into this program. The project experiences really cemented my understanding of key concepts and served as great additions to my data portfolio. I was able to showcase my skills using various machine learning models, including more advanced Deep Learning algorithms.</span></p>



<p><b>How did you find the Career Support experience at BrainStation throughout the program and once you graduated?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The support is always there when needed. They have even reached out to me to check on my job search, directed me to potential leads, and offered to provide feedback on my resume and portfolio.</span></p>



<p><b>You had previously worked in a Data Analyst role, how did the Data Science program further your skill set and data capabilities?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned various tools, techniques, and strategies that I didn&#8217;t have before, and the program has completely changed the way I view data. I can now understand and even recommend data science solutions while having the confidence to build them myself, which is something I find extremely rewarding.</span></p>



<p><b>You now work as a Senior Analyst for Loblaw Companies Limited, can you tell us more about this role and what a typical day looks like?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I can’t share the specifics of what I’m working on, currently, my role involves a lot of meetings and strategy discussion around data. As my current project moves forward, there will be work with cloud-based databases and model building and testing.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that the knowledge I acquired from the BrainStation program has been critical to the value I provide for my new employer.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What advice would you give to someone looking to pursue a role in data?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would say that it&#8217;s important to remember that understanding data is more than just knowing what the numbers mean. You need to be able to see its meaning and effect in real world applications. Having an open-mind that&#8217;s never done learning is the best way to gain these perspectives.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve written about in the past, demand for data-related professionals <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science">is expected to rise by 28 percent</a> in the next two years, with a projected 2.7 million new jobs. Now is the best time to gain data skills. BrainStation&#8217;s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-analytics?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenDSandAnalysts">Data Analytics course</a> and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-science?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenDSandAnalysts">Data Science course</a> will give you the skills needed to thrive in a data driven world.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrainStation 2019 Digital Skills Survey</a>, 79 percent of data respondents did not begin their career in data, and 65 percent have been working in it for five years or less. This&nbsp;suggests that while the data field is growing fast, it is still in the early stages of its development, with multiple career paths available. In fact,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he survey found that while the aforementioned demand is typically associated with &#8220;Data Scientists,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a majority of data professionals currently work under different titles, most notably&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“Data Analyst” and “Business Analyst.”</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.56-PM.png" alt="Data professionals are new to the industry" class="wp-image-8544" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.56-PM.png 703w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.56-PM-300x122.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what&#8217;s the difference between a&nbsp;Data Scientist&nbsp;and a&nbsp;Data Analyst?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally speaking, the difference has been rooted in professional and educational backgrounds, with Data Scientists typically earning graduate-level, or higher, degrees. Of course, given the rate at which the world of work is changing – 74 percent of executives claimed that their organizations were actively investing in digital transformation initiatives, with 89 percent claiming there are elements of their products and services that did not exist five years earlier – this too may be changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the things we found:</span></p>



<h1><b>Data Scientists Use Python (and More)</b></h1>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to what technology data professionals were using, Excel emerged as the most widely used tool in the Digital Skills Survey, at close to 81 percent. This was followed by SQL, Python, and Tableau.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.42-PM.png" alt="Excel most widely used tool for data professionals" class="wp-image-8545" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.42-PM.png 692w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.42-PM-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excel&#8217;s presence at the top of the list was somewhat surprising, so we dug a bit deeper to see&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how these responses were broken down by job title. We looked at the five major categories of respondent roles (Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist, Researcher, Data Analytics Manager) to see the distribution of tools they used. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found that Data Scientists relied much less on Excel. In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respondents with this job title were the only ones to cite the programming language </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenDSandAnalysts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as their most frequently used tool. Data Scientists also reported the usage of a much wider range of secondary tools, including SQL and Tableau. You can learn how to use tools like these as part of BrainStation&#8217;s comprehensive Data Science curriculum.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, the Data Scientist job title traditionally implied a more senior level of experience and training, and these survey findings would seem to back this up; additional knowledge and skills would provide more exposure to a programming language like Python, as well as any additional relevant technology.</span></p>



<h1><b>Data Analysts Optimize; Data Scientists Develop </b></h1>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most data respondents in the digital skills survey said they spent the bulk of their time wrangling data and cleaning it up. The primary use of data, meanwhile, was devoted mostly to the optimization of existing platforms and products, as well as the development of new ideas, products, and services.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we broke this down by the major job titles, another difference emerged between Data Analysts and Scientists: The majority of Business Analyst and Data Analyst respondents tend to focus more on optimizing existing platforms and products. Data Scientists, on the other hand, work primarily on developing new ideas, products, and services. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference here may again be explained by experience and knowledge levels, as more skilled and experienced Data Scientists would likely be more involved in high-level, strategic planning and development. </span></p>



<h1><b>Neither are Working With AI (Yet)</b></h1>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where these two job titles unite, is in their expectations for the future. 77 percent of data respondents say they don&#8217;t work with <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/skills-youll-need-to-lead-the-ai-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, which may be surprising, given the attention AI has received. It may be, though, that since data respondents are more familiar with AI, they are more hesitant to use the term than say, Marketers.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.29-PM.png" alt="Data professionals expect machine learning to have an impact" class="wp-image-8546" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.29-PM.png 727w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-Shot-2019-03-27-at-3.52.29-PM-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, data respondents did feel that <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-machine-learning-is-and-what-it-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning</a><em> and</em> AI would have the most impact on the next five to 10 years, with blockchain, and internet-of-things technology coming in third and fourth. If this turns out to be true, it looks like this fast-evolving field will continue to change.<br></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BCG’s 2018 digital maturity survey of top restaurant brands found that 80 percent had access to a wealth of data. There’s a big opportunity there – BCG’s numbers found that <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#data,on-campus#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_datausedinrestaurants">data and analytics programs</a> yield five to 10 percent increases in revenue, 10 to 15 percent reductions in store-level operating costs, and 10 to 20 percent improvements in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization). Further, digital restaurant leaders’ total shareholder return has almost doubled the S&amp;P 500. And the National Restaurant Association’s 2019 State of the Industry report found that eight in 10 restaurant operators agree that the use of technology provides a competitive advantage and many planned to ramp up their efforts in that area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, data could be critical to the ongoing health of the restaurant business. An August 2018 report from The NPD Group found that the total restaurant count in the U.S. saw a one percent year-over-year decrease. Unlocking the insights of the reams of numbers available to restaurants could be crucial to their survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the ways big data has already transformed the food industry, and what further changes might be on the horizon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it seems like every fast-casual restaurant and coffee chain has a mobile app these days, there’s a good reason – it’s a crucial way to help you order faster while also learning more about you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And restaurant and delivery mobile apps are indeed more popular than ever. BCG’s study found that the installed user base for three top apps – Starbucks, McDonald’s, and Dominos – has grown from 45 million users to 76 million from June 2016 to 2018, while the number of users with Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub leaped from 9 million to 42 million over that same period. A survey </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/483857/restaurant-apps-usage-reasons-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that most diners use restaurant mobile apps to view menus and prices (55 percent), scour deals (38.2 percent), order food (30 percent), and reserve a table (23.8 percent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BCG’s numbers, U.S. restaurant loyalty programs now also have a combined 130 million members, more than double their 2015 level – which means dining is the fastest-growing industry for loyalty programs. More than two-thirds of diners are members of at least one such program, and 25 percent say they’re members of three or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps generally have the effect of bringing customers back more often. In fact, 40 percent of app users </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-ca/publications/2018/feeding-algorithm-restaurants-use-data-capture-competitive-advantage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they increased their visit frequency after downloading. Research from BCG shows that restaurant companies with “well-defined, strategically executed” loyalty programs can boost incremental revenues by 10 to 15 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does your data play into that? Starbucks’ app is a good example. The company’s loyalty program is a gold standard for personalization, with tailored messages and offers being sent to people based on their ordering history. Starbucks often uses the program to get you in the door, whether you’re a regular – for instance, if you ordered a Venti Americano three days in a row, you might receive an email with incentives to extend your coffee streak another few days – or a lapsed customer who might be tempted back with a too-good-to-be-true deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made massive investments and made progress on personalization, ahead of what I would say other restaurant brands to date have been able to accomplish,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/personalized-fast-food-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Martin, a Partner at BCG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? Their app just keeps getting more popular – according to Starbucks’ 2019 third-quarter results, active Starbucks Rewards Membership in the U.S. increased 14 percent year-over-year to 17.2 million users.</span></p>
<h3><b>Improve Operating Efficiency</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data isn’t just being used to bring more hungry patrons into the restaurant – it’s also having a major back-of-house impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from Toast found that 78 percent of restaurant managers look at their metrics and finances daily, compared to 46 percent two years prior. And 95 percent of restaurateurs think technology improves efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of that is the fast-casual chain Panera Bread, which unveiled its Panera 2.0 plan to drive digital orders in 2014. Panera collects information about orders on all its digital channels to prepare for in-store labor and product needs, and that data has informed real changes at the chain, including redesigned kitchens and a reworked assembly line. As a result of those changes, the chain – which now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> half of all sales could soon be digital – </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-panera-solved-its-mosh-pit-problem-1496395801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut its wait time to order food from eight minutes to one minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not alone in leveraging data to smooth their operating process. Domino’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built an algorithm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to predict how long it would take to make and deliver a pizza – with factors including number and tenure of staff in the restaurant – while UberEats and DoorDash are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop the best model to predict delivery time, taking into account weather data, sports schedules, and seasonal irregularities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is also helping restaurateurs recognize their star employees – and who might be underperforming. It’s especially helpful for people managing multiple restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Charlee Williamson of the New Orleans-based Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group oversaw six managers and 78 servers on the other side of the country, at California’s Jazz Kitchen. She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Server Scorecard, offered by the restaurant management software company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avero</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ranks servers on multiple criteria and helps match the right waiter to the right table. For instance, a server who ranks higher in sales might be the right fit for a high-rolling party, while another who excels at tip percentage could be best-suited to handle a difficult table full of rowdy children.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nailing the Menu (and Finding Flavor Trends)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Applebee’s made the rather radical shift in 2016 to what was thought to be a millennial-friendly menu, it didn’t work out – to put it mildly. The chain announced in 2017 plans to close over 100 locations, and executives pointed to the fact that the youth-focused offerings had alienated what they believed to be their core guests: boomers and gen-Xers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company went back to the drawing board, they did so armed with data. Adrian Butler, the SVP and Chief Information Officer of Dine Brands (the parent company of Applebee’s), outlined a 4D technology strategy to help the restaurant regain its momentum: Data, Discovery, Dining, Delivery. The focus was on “leveraging data and analytics of our guests and operations to craft personalized experiences,” beginning with the menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applebee’s began to poll its customers via tabletop device surveys, and by the end of 2017, the chain had noticed a 7 percent uptick in overall guest satisfaction. As they dug deeper into data, they also realized why their millennial-focused menu had been such a misfire – their clientele was already evenly </span><a href="https://www.michiganstateuniversityonline.com/resources/business-analytics/dining-on-big-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">split</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among generations, with 26.4 percent boomers, 28.3 percent gen-Xers, and 29.9 percent millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data isn’t just useful for restaurants looking to make their menus shine. It also helps us understand what foods are whetting American appetites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pork lovers among us might have noticed that bacon is suddenly everywhere – in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sundaes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cocktails, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And thanks to Wired, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Food Network to analyze 49,733 recipes and 906,539 comments from their website, we learned that everything really is better with bacon. Together, they searched all the recipes that fit a certain description – pizza, for instance – and calculated the average rating for those foods that did not include bacon. They found that the recipes with bacon did score higher – and the only exceptions were among pasta and desserts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They drilled deeper and looked at other food fads and how they’ve waxed and waned over time, with ingredients like Portobello mushrooms and sriracha seemingly being past their moment in the sun. Lada Adamic, a Computer Scientist at the University of Michigan and Facebook, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wired’s research even further and found that feta, cream cheese, cranberries, strawberries, and avocado were also reliable recipe hits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate project, Adamic wanted to see if it was possible to create a predictive algorithm to see how a recipe would turn out. She and her team took nearly 50,000 recipes and 2 million reviews from allrecipes.com and created an algorithm to extract out all the ingredients, cooking methods, and nutritional profiles, then looked at how often two ingredients were paired together in the same recipe. She </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/11/19/165294248/could-nate-silver-predict-how-good-your-pumpkin-pie-will-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that her algorithm predicted with nearly 80 percent accuracy how many stars a recipe would get on the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Adamic was inspired by her own kitchen frustrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was having trouble moving beyond literally reading the recipe and then following it exactly,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, I just believe in data,” she added. “Now I feel more comfortable using spices more freely.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Improve Customer Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since few are forecasting a big leap in restaurant patronage, many restaurateurs have shifted from focusing on the number of customers to the quality of experience each visitor has – and data has been a big help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total restaurant traffic is not growing, so anything restaurants can do to offer a better customer experience differentiates them from the competition,” </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-restaurants-are-using-big-data-as-a-competitive-tool-1538515392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Portalatin, a food-industry adviser at market-research firm NPD Group Inc. and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating Patterns in America.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the primary way most restaurants are capitalizing on data to form a better bond with diners is through personalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TGI Fridays, for instance, began gathering data from point-of-sale systems, social media, credit-card transactions, and mobile devices to create personalized campaigns for the four million-plus guests who have given the company permission to contact them directly. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">result</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was stark: the chain doubled its to-go business in the 12 months leading up to August 2018 and increased social media engagement by more than 500 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gone are the days of trying to figure out what millennials want versus boomers,” </span><a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/10/10/17957350/restaurants-data-mining-personal-information-privacy-loyalty-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TGI Fridays Chief Experience Officer Sherif Mityas. “We want to know what Mary wants versus Susan, and we need an unprecedented amount of data, analytics, and machine-learning to utilize this data in the best possible way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based reservation systems allow restaurants to create detailed profiles on patrons with notes on everything from dietary restrictions to beer preferences. That information could be shared across an entire restaurant group, allowing servers to offer a customer their favorite IPA or a not-too-spicy appetizer they might love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants have numerous ways to collect that data. McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A dangle free food in exchange for diners filling out surveys rating their experience. Starbucks has always offered free wi-fi, but as of April 2018, the coffee chain </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Starbucks-wifi-policy-change-481089611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users to submit their full name, email address, and zip code before surfing the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California-based chain Tender Greens, meanwhile, uses the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Punchh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile app to log each customer’s name, email address, and purchase history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives us ways to recognize people who’ve been in regularly or haven’t been in for a while or have specific preferences,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founder Erik Oberholtzer.  “We want to accommodate everyone’s needs, sometimes before they even mention them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just fast-food or fast-casual restaurants that are using data to boost customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s Michelin-starred </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oriole</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses data from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upserve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system to determine who are their top 100 guests (in terms of the number of visits and amount spent) and creates a profile with every first-time reservation. Upserve also tracks the top 100’s dining companions when they divide up the bill, sending a list of credit-card numbers, dates of visits and what was bought. The restaurant matches the numbers to a name, then uses social media to put a face to that name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t know that someone’s going to become a regular, so you don’t necessarily keep track of those people. But the system does,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Co-Owner Cara Sandoval, adding that they’re sure to recognize regulars when they come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn’t make the reservation themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the simple fact that ordering via a mobile device – whether for pickup or delivery – is just faster and more convenient than standing in line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, restaurant digital orders have grown at an average annual rate of 23 percent since 2013 – now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">representing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3.1 billion visits and $26.8 billion – and will triple in volume by the end of 2020, according to the NDP Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Digital orders will remain an outsized source of growth for the restaurant industry over the next few years and operators who desire to grow need to embrace a digital strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2019/mobile-apps-now-represent-the-bulk-of-restaurant-digital-orders-and-restaurant-branded-apps-dominate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Portalatin.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2009, Google’s Chief Economist, Hal Varian, told the</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey Quarterly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians.” As crazy as it might seem to use the words “sexy” and “statisticians” in the same sentence, he was right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly ten years later, we&#8217;re inundated by data. In fact, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-a-data-analytics-certificate-is-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">every day, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this avalanche of numbers has accomplished anything, it’s in making the benefits of data analysis abundantly clear. According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers from MIT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “companies in the top third of their industry in the use of data-driven decision making were, on average, 5 percent more productive and 6 percent more profitable than their competitors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no surprise, then, that data science jobs are some of the fastest-growing, most in-demand in technology. Since 2012, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientist roles have increased by 650 percent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and this rise shows no sign of stopping. In the next two years alone, the number of available data jobs in the US will increase by 364,000 to 2.7 million. In response to this influx, data courses such as BrainStation&#8217;s full-time <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BSTNblog&amp;utm_campaign=WhatisDataScience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science Diploma program</a> are on the rise to help fill the rise in job openings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the question remains&#8230;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Data Science? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science makes use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics, and <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-machine-learning-is-and-what-it-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> to help us make predictions, and more importantly, decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s put it in simpler terms: data science uses math and technology to find hidden patterns (and ways to be more productive and profitable) in raw data. To find those patterns, a Data Scientist spends a lot of time collecting, cleaning, modeling, and examining data, from numerous angles (some of which have not been looked at before). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
This exhaustive approach is one of the reasons why, as Biostatistics Professor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Leek once wrote</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “the key word in data science is not data; it is science.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find hidden patterns, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-scientist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Scientist</a> uses a combination of techniques and concepts, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predictive causal analytics: predicts the possibilities of an event in the future. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prescriptive analytics: suggests a range of actions and their associated outcomes. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning: algorithms used on data to discover patterns and make predictions. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t to say that a Data Scientist spends all his or her time with numbers and algorithms. They can, in fact, be heavily involved in the decision-making process across departments — and to do so they will have to communicate their findings to other human beings. This is how the authors of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing Data Science</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> described it: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’ll find patterns, build models, and algorithms — some with the intention of understanding product usage and the overall health of the product, and others to serve as prototypes that ultimately get baked back into the product. She may design experiments, and she is a critical part of data-driven decision making. She’ll communicate with team members, engineers, and leadership in clear language and with data visualizations so that even if her colleagues are not immersed in the data themselves, they will understand the implications.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you Become a Data Scientist?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Data Scientist requires a number of technical skills to excel in their field, but if we were to boil it down, they must be able to: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Collect and store data, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">particularly</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the use of databases, spreadsheets, and querying languages, such SQL.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Analyze and model data sets </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Python, R, Hadoop, and Spark, among other analytical tools. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Visualize and present findings, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">using tools like Tableau, PowerBI, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plotly, Bokeh, and Matplotlib, among others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, of course, quite a bit of non-technical skills required as well. Communication skills are fundamental — if you can’t communicate your findings to someone that does not possess your understanding of data, you’re not going to succeed. Similarly, a Data Scientist should have a strong business acumen and domain specific knowledge. What are the challenges facing the industry? What about the company? Being able to answer these types of questions will help guide the data analysis process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does a Data Scientist do?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Data Scientist’s specific tasks can vary depending on the industry they’re in, and the company they work for. Generally speaking, though, he or she can expect some or all of the following daily tasks and responsibilities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching your industry and company to identify pain points, opportunities for growth, and improvements in efficiency and productivity, among other things. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining relevant data sets, and then extracting data from various sources. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning data to remove anything unusable and checking that the rest is accurate and uniform. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating and applying algorithms to implement automation tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modeling and analyzing data to identify patterns and trends. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating visualizations or dashboards for other members of the organization to consult.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting findings to other members of the organization. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what Jeremy, the Lead Educator for BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BSTNblog&amp;utm_campaign=WhatIsDataScience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science Diploma Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had to say: “Data science work ranges from digging deep into the math of specific techniques, developing and implementing models to describe the data, working to automate processes and explaining results to clients. You might be coding an algorithm in the morning, and in a board meeting in the afternoon.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the Roles of a Data Scientist? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientists can work across many different industries, and can often play an interdisciplinary role in a company. Because of this, common job titles for Data Scientists tend to be quite varied.</span></p>
<p>Here, however, are some of the most common data science job titles:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientist&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Analyst</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Architect</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Engineer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistician</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database Administrator</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Analyst</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data and Analytics Manager</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researcher </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many other variations out there, and these will continue to evolve as data analysis becomes more prevalent. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that almost all of these positions are in great demand. As we mentioned above, job listings for data-related roles are projected to skyrocket over the next two years, to the point where demand may outstrip supply. American consulting firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mckinsey &amp; Company claims that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand may be 50 to 60 percent greater than the projected supply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of data professionals. This is backed up by the fact that employers are already struggling to fill data roles: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on average, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data science/analytics jobs remain open for 45 days </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— five days longer than the market average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that to say, if you have data science skills and experience, you are already in a great position when it comes to career development and progression. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Average Salary of a Data Scientist?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, salary ranges can vary greatly depending on the region you’re in and your level of experience. That said, Data Scientist salaries tend to be on the high end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Glassdoor reported that the average salary for a Data Scientist is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$118,709</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Payscale, meanwhile, claims that the median pay for Data Scientists in the United States is in the area of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$94K per year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div>

</div>
<h2><b>Data Engineer </b><b></b></h2>
<p><b>What they do:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Data Engineers collect, store, and organize data. Job ads for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Engineers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will typically list a range of responsibilities, including the ability to source external data, build data warehouses, and design data models </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– three </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tasks that build a foundation for data analytics and machine learning (we’ll cover those roles next). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><b>Skills needed:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Data Engineers will benefit from a background in computer science, math, or engineering, knowledge of coding languages like </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-programming-languages-should-you-be-learning"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structured Query Language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SQL, a programming language used in database management) Python, Java or Ruby, and the ability to manage and design databases.</span></p>
<h2><b>Data Analyst</b></h2>
<p><b>What they do: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once information is organized and accessible thanks to the work of a Data Engineer, Data Analysts transform data into insights that can solve problems, optimize products, and help make evidence-based decisions. Data Analysts can take complex information and turn it into stats that business execs can use to inform strategy and planning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts also create easy-to-understand data visualizations like charts and graphs. Similar jobs include Operations Research Analysts and Business Intelligence Analysts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Skills needed:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Knowledge of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL is the foundation for a career in data analytics. Also essential is knowledge of other coding languages, including Python or R and the ability to create data visualizations using software like Tableau.</span></p>
<h2><b>Data Scientist&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><b>What they do: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the company, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Data Scientist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be expected to do the work of a Data Engineer and Data Analyst (collect, organize, and analyze data) in addition to more strategic data work. Where the Data Scientist role differs from the Data Analyst and Engineer’s role is in the Data Scientist’s ability to lead a company’s big data strategy by asking the right questions and developing new ideas, products, and services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about the difference between a Data Analyst and Data Scientist in this BrainStation </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-data-scientist-and-a-data-analyst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Skills needed: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientists cited Python as the most frequently used tool in BrainStation’s 2019 </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other skills needed include most of the tools and skills listed above (SQL, Tableau, other programming languages, and an understanding of how databases are built and maintained), as well as strong communication skills and business acumen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Machine Learning Engineer&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><b>What they do: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably won’t be surprised to learn that there are also similarities between Data Scientists and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/machine-learning-supervised-unsupervised-reinforcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning Engineers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both work with data to produce insights. The difference is that Data Scientists uncover insights to present to people (for example, CEOs and other business leaders), while Machine Learning Engineers design the software that can uncover insights and learn from results as more and more data is gathered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Skills needed: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Half</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Machine Learning Engineers need advanced math skills, programming skills (Python, R, Java), knowledge of Hadoop, data modeling experience, and experience working in an Agile environment.&nbsp;</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Marie-France Cardin, the Founder of The Winning Partnership and a BrainStation professional development student. After 35 years of experience working for global organizations like PwC and KPMG, Marie-France is taking on her first major entrepreneurial endeavor. Looking to advance her skillset and better prepare for a competitive digital landscape, Marie-France decided to pursue digital skills training, and has recently completed her fourth Certificate Course at BrainStation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-9364 alignleft" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MF_photo-1.jpg" alt="Entrepreneur" width="221" height="332" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MF_photo-1.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MF_photo-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" />We chatted with Marie-France about her experience at BrainStation, why she decided to invest in her education, and how she’s using her newly developed skills.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a bit about your career and education background prior to BrainStation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many years ago I studied Public Relations at McGill University in Montréal, and then went on to do a certificate in Broadcast Journalism. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with some large organizations – Molson Breweries of Canada, the Montréal Chamber of Commerce, Steinberg/Ivanhoe Cambridge, PwC, the Montréal Exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 18 years my career has been dedicated to partnering with professionals at KPMG as the National Director, Pursuits and Proposals, to win new business as part of a targeted pursuit effort. After my first five years in Montréal as a bid manager, I moved to Toronto to deploy sales enablement support. I led a team of 35 people operating from Canada and India. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with the practitioners and sales and marketing resources, we submitted proposals to both private and publicly-held organizations and government. I had to focus on ensuring that the end-to-end pursuit process was scalable and agile in order to meet the needs of clients, procurement, and technology. </span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><b>You’re in the midst of starting your own business, can you tell us about it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My new venture is called The Winning Partnership, and with it I’m embracing the opportunity to join forces with emerging industries, professional services, and not-for-profits to frame and deliver solutions that speak to the needs of their clients. Using agile, iterative principles we will work to co-design imaginative and original approaches to help compete, grow and succeed in fierce environments through sales enablement expertise.</span></p>
<p><b>In your opinion, what is the value of developing your technical skills before diving into an entrepreneurial endeavour?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients are very sophisticated and well informed, and as an entrepreneur in client services you have to solve for a problem. So if you want to be in a true partnership with your clients and collaborate efficiently with your associates, you need to have the technical skills to back up your claims. No one can excel at everything or work solo, but I think it’s crucial to surround yourself with the right people and skill sets to be able to handle diverse challenges. </span></p>
<p><b>You recently completed your fourth course at BrainStation, what has been your motivation behind taking each of these courses?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been speaking the same lingo for the past 18 years, and I needed to look at things from a different – and fresh – perspective. I enjoy taking courses, but I am not an academic and prefer instructor-led training to learning something on my own. So the idea of frequenting a technology school in my neighborhood that has campuses across North America was quite appealing. Also, being surrounded by intelligent, technologically capable individuals is quite fun and really helps push your boundaries.</span></p>
<p><b>Do you feel like the courses have complemented each other? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve taken Design Thinking, Agile, Digital Marketing, and Data Analytics. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/agile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were definitely complementary as they both deal with the process of building digital products and developing processes for solving business problems. I have no doubt that these two courses will be very helpful as I partner with clients in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Analytics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that I could develop a better understanding of the two subjects. In today’s world, I need to be in a position to discuss and integrate with my clients when necessary, and want to make sure that my skills and knowledge are up to speed. </span></p>
<p><b>What are the most valuable lessons you have learned in your BrainStation courses?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for the problem to solve, keep on being curious, don’t be afraid to ask questions, and collaboration is the key to success. Be sure to push your boundaries outside of your comfort zone. </span></p>
<p><b>How are you using the skills you’ve learned to further your business?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to completing four BrainStation courses this year, I’ve invested my time learning more about the Cannabis Industry. For our final project in the Data Analytics class, my workgroup volunteered to look at data on recreational consumption. The outcome of our analysis was to determine the number of cannabis retail outlets required to satisfy demand in Toronto and eliminate the black market. Now, my plan isn’t to open a retail cannabis store, but the analysis we completed shows that there is definitely room for the Ontario government to grant more licences – over 100 of them in Toronto alone – to meet the demand.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you describe the learning experience at BrainStation? What has been your favourite part?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first time I walked into BrainStation to enquire about Design Thinking, I&#8217;ve loved every minute. The ambiance is conducive to learning in an agile, collaborative manner and I cannot praise the experience, expertise and knowledge of the instructors enough. I appreciated that the instructors bring a consultant approach to the curriculum and aren&#8217;t tied to one specific organization. Their wide industry experience and network are a big plus in the learning environment, and I’ve been very impressed with their ability to adjust to the students in class and tailor their instruction when needed to meet the needs of the broader group.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in professional development, BrainStation offers <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#part-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">courses</a> in Data, Design, Product, Marketing, and Development.
