<p><strong>Women in Digital Leadership | Shaping Stronger Pathways</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 25th, and featured a stellar lineup of women in digital leadership representing Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics and Instacart.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/529460562" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>



<p>As the tech industry grows, women are making up a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before – but much work remains to be done. While equitable participation across the industry as a whole is a laudable benchmark, it’s not enough. Representation in every job category and at all levels of seniority remains a challenge. Many of the obstacles to better representation in digital leadership are structural, and will require structural changes to fix. Fortunately, there are programs in place, and as their success in helping women achieve positions of leadership grows, so too does the opportunity to kick off a virtuous cycle. </p>



<p>The event lineup included six women in positions of leadership at prominent global companies: Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics, and Instacart. Together, our panelists weighed in on the importance of the initiatives already in place, issues that still need to be confronted, and what can women do as individuals to advance themselves and others in their careers. These are just a few of the many great points that arose during our discussion.</p>



<h2><strong>Mentorship Is the Key to Bridging the First Step</strong></h2>



<p>The transition into management can be an especially difficult one for women – an early inequality that can impact women’s careers over the long term. Shelli Brunswick, Chief Operating Officer at The Space Foundation, explains, “As you’re looking to make that first step on the ladder to being a leader, finding a mentor, a champion, and a coach can be critical..”. She also emphasizes the importance of paying it forward, saying that “once you have a mentor, always remember that you can be a mentor to and help the next generation behind you.”</p>



<p>Often, finding a mentor begins with networking. As Vice President of Product Innovation at Verizon Sanyogita Shamsunder says, “Be open, be collaborative, communicate, go talk to others about their projects and show genuine interest in their work. And get help. The first person that you approach may not may not be open or receptive, but don’t give up. Keep talking to people, both men and women, junior to you, senior to you – it doesn’t matter. We need to communicate. There’s no substitute for that.”</p>



<p>But besides being open to all networking opportunities, what can we do to find mentors – especially the right ones? To start with, it can’t hurt to ask. “You should always be looking for people that you have an affinity with, who really believe in you, and who are willing to go to bat for you when times are tough,” says Frida Polli, CEO &amp; Co-founder of A.I.-powered recruitment platform Pymetrics. “You definitely need to be reaching out to those folks…Just continually be looking for folks that appreciate and believe in what you’re doing.”</p>



<p>Still, approaching a possible mentor can be intimidating. As Tehmina Haider, Vice President and Head of Harry’s Labs at Harry’s Inc., says, “When you ask someone to be a mentor, you’re asking them for their time. The more senior they are, the more precious their time is. So it is a big ask, [but] most leaders actually enjoy seeing other people grow; that’s why they became leaders.” And overcoming your reluctance to approach mentors will pay off: “You need folks who can supplement you in different ways, to have that diversity. Women, because they tend to identify with other women, do often reach out to a female mentor, but you want your mentors to have different points of view than you do. And that’s where pushing for those male mentors is really, really important. So take that leap.</p>



<p>Vice President of Digital &amp; Cybersecurity Solutions at Mastercard Sukhmani Dev concurs, and emphasizes that finding a mentor is sometimes a question of timing. “Things happen organically as you grow forward. I find that [potential mentors] need to have a sense of who you are and what you’re capable of, and have seen you in action…If I really enjoyed working with a boss of mine, and then I’m changing roles or they’re changing roles, I may ask them, ‘Let’s continue the dialogue.’ It was more of a formal ask when I was more junior…but [where I am now], you just call them up when you have a question.”</p>



<p>Darrah Joy-Clay, Account Director of CPG Brands at Instacart, encourages women to ask for what they need. “As I’ve grown in my role, I find that the negotiations become a lot more complex. And when I’m going through a negotiation, of course I consult my female mentors. But it’s my male mentors who really give me that extra level of confidence, and re-emphasize not to be shy or fearful of making an ask of what I’m deserving of, or what I need to be happy and fulfill my role.”</p>



<h2><strong>Support Isn’t Just a Relationship – It’s Also a Culture</strong></h2>



<p>Advocating for yourself is important – but so is advocating for each other. How can companies help to support their female employees and foster a culture that supports women? Several panelists mentioned how important it is to carve out space for women to speak, to encourage them to speak, and to draw attention to their contributions and successes, which can get overlooked in environments structured around male authority. As always, mentorship is important. But even the way we provide day-to-day feedback can help, though criticism can be hard to receive – and to give.</p>



<p>As Haider explains, delivering criticism is about “making sure that the women on your team understand that the feedback that you’re giving them, even if it’s sometimes not that great to hear, is coming from a place of really caring about them. And that’s really hard, as a leader. Giving difficult feedback is not the easiest thing to do, but you’ve got to invest in it, and you’ve got to make sure that folks understand why it’s actually an indication of how much you care.”</p>



<p>For Joy-Clay, that’s aided by an environment where leadership is able to be transparent and talk about their own successes and failures without fear of judgment. “When I share my journey to leadership and I’m transparent with my teams, they can identify and relate with some of the experiences that I’ve had,” she says. “Several mentors of mine who have, one, shared their personal journey with me. But secondly, they’ve exposed me to communities and to rooms and to opportunities that I may not have been in before…and that exposure, I think, is a huge opportunity for leaders and mentees.”</p>



<h2><strong>Policies Need to Acknowledge There Are Many Paths</strong></h2>



<p>While cultivating a supportive environment may seem like an enigmatic exercise, it ultimately comes down to the policies a company puts in place. As Shamsunder says, “One of the first things that we have to do to create programs [to support women] is to recognize that there is an inequality.” This often starts with highlighting the different ways that people contribute to the company – including people with different levels of educational attainment, people in different locations.</p>



<p>There are many paths to STEM, and overlooking some in favor of others is detrimental to employees following unorthodox paths, which often includes women. At Mastercard, Dev explains, “We have a particular program that [assists] women who want to change their careers midway through – nurturing that and helping them explore different areas, explore technological areas.”</p>



<p>Spreading opportunity around isn’t as simple as promoting women up the corporate ladder. And it doesn’t happen by accident. At The Space Foundation, Brunswick says, they take a multi-pronged approach specifically designed to tackle the problem from different angles: raising awareness of careers in STEM, providing more people with access and training, helping to connect potential STEM workers to opportunity, and finally, mentoring to encourage equity in leadership. “Our goal at the Space Foundation is to highlight all those career paths. And we would say it’s about diversity and inclusion, but those underrepresented groups could be rural communities or inner cities, as well as regions of the world.” Matching protégés to mentors is an important step, but it’s just one of many; promoting more women into digital leadership roles in STEM means nurturing an entire talent pipeline that begins with reaching out to girls early in their education and letting them know that they can find a place in STEM.</p>



<p>And more women in STEM is good not only for women: “What we’ve learned is when women around the world are empowered to be entrepreneurs, they elevate not only themselves but their families and their communities as well,” Polli says. “It’s valuable to our entire world and ecosystem to empower women, to provide them the financing and support them in becoming entrepreneurs.”</p>



<h2><strong>Confidence Can Be a Greater Obstacle Than Competence</strong></h2>



<p>Confidence looks different in different people, and in situations with a gender imbalance, women may be at a disadvantage. Here, leadership can help to rebalance the scales, for example, by specifically calling on younger talent to speak up. “Leaders have a key role to play. If you’re on a table where you have young talent and they’re not speaking up, it’s your responsibility to pause and ask them for their point of view, create a space that they feel comfortable in…We can just take two minutes out of our time as leaders to convey that to younger talent. You’ll make them that much more comfortable and confident going forward and feel like their voice is appreciated,” Dev says.</p>



<p>For that younger talent, learning to overcome fear&nbsp; takes practice. “One [strategy] is to give more time and attention to your emotional skills, in terms of developing yourself and your emotional responses to rejection, to negative consequences,” Joy-Clay advises. “If we develop that muscle, that emotional response will be less fearful of what the consequences are on the other end.” This becomes ever easier the more willing leadership is to make space for failure and drop the expectation of perfection. “We have to start speaking more about our failures,” Joy-Clay continues. “If we talk more broadly about the mistakes we’ve made, the failures we’ve had, that would empower more young female leaders to not be afraid to fail, and not be afraid to be their authentic selves in the workplace.”</p>



<p>To Polli, it’s less a question of having confidence and more about how men and women project their confidence differently. “What it means to look confident is actually a very male image,” she says, explaining that what may seem like a lack of confidence is actually a decision not to project overconfidence. The solution is “more about having enough women in positions of leadership that can present an alternative image of what confidence looks like, rather than everyone feeling like, ‘I need to fit the mold of male confidence.’”</p>



<p>On one hand, Haider says, “It’s about pushing women to be confident, be bold, and really demonstrate that confidence externally. But it’s also about changing the metrics that we have around what confidence is, so that the way women show up also feels resonant.”</p>

<p><strong>Designing Inclusive Digital Experiences</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 11, and featured four inclusive design and user experience experts from Headspace, Capital One, and Google.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/522939888" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Inclusivity is fundamental to making digital experiences and products accessible to the largest possible group of users. It plays out in all the ways users interact with digital products – which means technology is a key factor in making a user journey successful.</p>



<p>Today, as technology improves and the interface between user and product becomes ever more seamless, the definition of inclusivity is growing to encompass not just a product’s functionality for all users, but also its ability to satisfy all users at an emotional level – an ambition that comprises an even wider range of considerations.</p>



<p>Our panel lineup included four people working at the forefront of designing inclusive digital experiences – from Google and Google Assistant, meditation app Headspace, and banking company Capital One. Together, they shared their insights on how the umbrella of inclusivity is expanding, the centrality of the user and their journey to the design process, and how to successfully build more inclusivity into digital experiences. <br></p>



<h2><strong>Inclusivity Is More Than Accessibility</strong></h2>



<p>Ensuring that digital products are physically accessible to nearly all users is increasingly seen as the bare minimum. Features like closed captioning for the hearing impaired, descriptive text for the visually impaired, and multiple ways of navigating for people with impaired motor skills not only mean that more users can access the product – they also send a powerful message about the importance of inclusivity to all users. While not feasible in every circumstance, universal accessibility can now be considered a baseline, at least in terms of ambition.</p>



<p>As <strong>Eunjoo Kim</strong>, UX Design Lead at Google Assistant, explains, “If you don’t apply inclusive design in your products, or in emerging technologies which have physical interactions, your design is not just bad, but is unusable.” </p>



<p>Inclusivity, in other words, is not an add-on; it’s a core design principle.</p>



<p>But inclusivity doesn’t end with a user’s ability to physically use the technology; it also speaks to multiple social dimensions, including language and nationality, race and ethnicity, sexuality, age, and socioeconomic status, as well as more fine-grained distinctions like one’s level of educational, financial situation or geographical location – even the way ideas like “family” means different things to different people.</p>



<p>As <strong>J.R. Miller</strong>, UX Writer and Product Designer at Google, says, “They need not all be lumped together like that. And indeed, it’s impossible to lump them all together.” There’s no one-size-fits-all template for making a product inclusive to everyone; each of these considerations must be weighed individually.</p>



<p>For <strong>Klaus Heesch</strong>, Director of Experience Design at banking group Capital One, inclusivity takes on a financial dimension, and includes topics like “the democratization of trading, for example, and access to the trading markets, which used to be just for wealthy white Wall Streeters,” he notes.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Input Determines Output</strong></h2>



<p>Heesch, summarizing a lesson from Antionette Carroll of Creative Reaction Lab, advises “Design <em>with</em> your customers, not <em>for</em> your customers.” But while letting your users shape your inclusivity design process can yield crucial insights, this advice comes with a caveat. To combat bias, input must be as inclusive as possible at every stage, from hiring to research and user testing to, finally, the data generated by end users.</p>



<p>When it comes to hiring, explains <strong>Frank Bach</strong>, Lead Product Designer at Headspace, inclusivity leads to better products. “If you can make [your design teams] as inclusive as possible – hearing from as many different people as you can, from different backgrounds, different life journeys, different languages, making sure that there’s not a lot of sameness in the types of people that you’re inviting to these groups – then you should have better outcomes. Not just business outcomes, but [also along] the more human metrics of, are people enjoying this product? Do they feel like it understands them? Do they feel some type of connection and community to the service or product that you’re building?” Today’s work-from-home climate has made achieving diversity in hiring much easier, Bach says, especially when it comes to hiring people whose experience includes a different set of circumstances than are found in Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Diversity is just as crucial to inclusivity at the research and testing stage, Kim says. “When we say ‘machine learning,’ sometimes you’d think it’s a magic box – it will magically happen. Well, it’s not true. The machine starts based on data that’s input from humans. Then the machine builds a solution – an output which inherits human bias….If you don’t have inclusive input, you won’t have inclusive output.” </p>



<p>“For user research and testing,” Kim says, “recruiting a diverse set of participants is important. We try to include people with different accents and different family types.</p>



<p>Miller agrees. “The most important tool we’ve been using, especially on my team, is listening: listening to users, listening to each other, and listening deeply before we even make a design decision that will impact inclusivity.”</p>



<p>“Users are the designers,” Kim explains. “They are content creators, they are content reviewers, and they are product sellers,” she says. “So users are a part of this ecosystem.”<br></p>



<h2><strong>Fight For The User</strong></h2>



<p>This emphasis on being responsive to all users is at the heart of designing inclusivity; the UX Designer’s mandate is, in a sense, to fight for the user. In any product design, there are always competing interests, but as Bach explains, championing the user is a priority from both a user case and a business case.</p>



<p>“We’re not singling out that this is a product experience for this type of person or that type of person,” Bach says. “And on the product side or the user experience side, we’re making sure that when we’re setting things up – for example, our design system components – we’re working on buttons, states, or typography to make sure that we’re covering our bases for things like proper color contrasts, or using haptic feedback in a way that is meaningful for people….And as a designer, I think I’m getting smarter at building the business case for getting these things done. You know what is the right thing to do, but in a company of a few hundred people, it can sometimes be a challenge to fight for the user and only the user.”</p>



<p>Miller agrees, emphasizing that keeping the user foremost in mind isn’t just about design – it’s also about content. “You have to think about the user, and speak like the user, and write in ways so that as many users as possible will understand you, as well as your product.” In fact, Miller emphasizes, voice is one of the most meaningful ways to build inclusivity; the wrong language can leave people feeling excluded.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Inclusivity Is About a Sense of Belonging</strong></h2>



<p>In fact, building that sense of belonging is the overarching goal of inclusivity measures. Usability and accessibility both signal to a user that a product was made for them, but inclusivity goes beyond user interface; language and content are also important. “When a user feels ‘It’s made for me, made for my family, made for my gender, made for my country,’ it just creates emotional satisfaction,” Kim says. “To me, design is not just a matter of usability or utility, but of feeling and happiness.”</p>



<p>For Miller, this begins with the word. “[It’s] important to think about language and voice and tone as a part of the design system of the product.” Miller warns against the use of idioms, which not only don’t translate well, but are also interpreted differently even between cultures that speak the same language: “Especially when you’re building a global product, you need to make sure that you’re writing language that can be understood by a global audience….And you want to make sure you’re writing at no more than an eighth grade reading level. I know it’s a hard thing to measure, but there are tools online that can help you figure that out….You don’t get any brownie points for sounding smart.”</p>



<p>Like all UX design, inclusive design ultimately comes down to empathy – taking care to speak like the user. </p>



<p>While personas have long been used to develop empathy, Heesch sees the way they define and limit understanding of the user as detrimental to building belonging, and predicts personas are on their way out. “[Our understanding of audience is] moving away from simplistic or generic personas,” Heesch says. “That idea that everyone’s going to fit into some sort of average is not appropriate, and it’s not inclusive, and it leaves a lot of people, in fact, excluded. Historically, a lot of designers have worked around the idea of a persona….The problem with that is, every individual isn’t locked into one mode, and doesn’t fit into one standard.”</p>



<p>In place of personas, Heesch looks to archetypes, which emphasize not the supposedly universal characteristics of a certain type of person, but rather where a given person is on their own personal path. “We have to understand that anyone, in any group, travels through their own journey, and our hurdles and the challenges that we face are many and different. Our experiences, socio-economic backgrounds, education, and many more factors shape our attitudes and our views,” he says. “We as designers have to take that into consideration….Our obligation as designers is to realize that we’re designing for the long haul, and these experiences that we’re making should evolve and adapt to our users’ place in life, meeting them where they are.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Great Acceleration</strong> – the latest instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series &#8211; took place on February 25 and featured leaders from <strong>Peloton</strong>, <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>KraftHeinz</strong>, <strong>Snyk</strong>, and<strong> Betterment</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the recap here:</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/516922129" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p></p>



<h2>Forming Digital-First Teams</h2>



<p>Following the unprecedented challenges 2020 presented to the world, BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Skills Survey looked to explore the state of digital transformations and what companies could be doing to build upon existing efforts to embrace a digital-first culture.</p>



<p>The survey found that digital acceleration shows no signs of slowing down, as 77 percent of organizations said they plan to increase their digital transformation activities and 80 percent said there are digital elements of their business that did not exist even two years ago.</p>



<p>Dipti Salopek, VP of People at Snyk said, “All companies are software companies now. Anything you consider standard retail is now e-commerce. It was going to be the way of the world and COVID just accelerated it.”</p>



<p>Global stay-at-home orders also saw the acceleration of remote work and the growth of international teams.</p>



<p>Brittany Forsyth, Chief Talent Officer at Shopify, spoke to Shopify’s policy for their employees of working “Digital by Default” early in 2020 to allow all team members to work remotely indefinitely moving forward.</p>



<p>“Working remotely had some challenges but it democratized interactions,” said Salopek. “Every participant and speaker and the same amount of voice and space, which made their all-hands meetings more engaging and collaborative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel, however, stressed the importance of gathering the right data –&nbsp;only this way can you identify and leverage the advantages presented by a digital-first work culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You need to have access to the right data in order to analyze it and make informed decisions,” said Serena Huang, Head of Global People Analytics at Kraft Heinz. “That is the starting point to know where you’re starting from and then you can understand what skills you need.”<br></p>



<h2>Know the Skills Already On Your Team</h2>



<p>More than ever, companies are now required to innovate to meet changing customer needs at the right time, and to deliver the right solutions.</p>



<p>Tim Brown, VP of Talent at Peloton, learned the importance of pressure-testing their own infrastructure after Peloton saw such hyper-growth in 2020 that it strained their existing supply chain. They now are able to find where their limitations are within the existing structure, and how to then overcome those limitations.</p>



<p>“You need to be able to get the right data as [your organization] continues to grow,” said Brown. “You could have 10 great Engineers, but if you don’t have a good Designer, all the work the Engineers did won’t translate to your customer.”</p>



<p>BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey shows that a key trend among respondents was that they felt their organization would be more successful with more data skills. What many companies fail to recognize, however, is that they often already have the skill sets they’re hiring for within their organization in unsuspecting positions.</p>



<p>Most companies can’t answer simple questions like how many people know Python really well. They may know how many Data Scientists they have; but your best Python knowledge-holder may work in finance,” Huang noted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know the scale of abilities already within your teams, you can create meaningful employee engagement opportunities by pairing a person’s skill set with their unique professional development goals. You can also look past technical competencies to find other ways that employees can add value to their team, including what Huang called ‘leadership skills,’ or soft skills, that are often developed in previous experiences.</p>



<p>“Learning agility seems to be an indicator of success compared to most other skills,” said Salopek. “The ability to step out of your comfort zone to try something new, and having the confidence to fail is a sought after skill to support digital transformation, especially for existing and emerging leaders.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Learn Today to Lead Tomorrow</h2>



<p>75 percent of executives who responded to the survey said they believe digital skills training would make them more successful.</p>



<p>Susan Justus, Senior Director and Head of Talent Development at Betterment, has been piloting a number of initiatives using design thinking that are geared towards emerging leaders and managers to keep learning.</p>



<p>“We believe in knowledge sharing,” said Justus.“We had the data analytics team present to other teams on how to better work with data analytics as not everyone thinks from an analytics mindset.”</p>



<p>Looking inward to create these learning opportunities provides insight for the hiring process when needing to source skills from outside your organization.</p>



<p>“When hiring teams, you have to look at the skills but also the competency,” said Brown. “How long would it take someone to learn the skills versus to bring someone on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huang agreed: “You need to find the right skills before you find the right talent. Be clear on the skills you need for your company to succeed.”</p>



<p>The Digital Skills Survey found that there are a number of emerging roles that can have a big impact on organizational growth, which employees can land by upskilling in key areas. These include: Artificial Intelligence Specialist, Experience Designer, Product Owner, Site Reliability Engineer, Cybersecurity Specialist, and Big Data Developer.</p>



<p>“Anything related and obliquely related to software development, including UX and product design, is going to be in demand for the foreseeable future,” Salopek added.</p>



<p>Marketing and Development are also the two disciplines that organizations are planning to hire the most in 2021, leaving lots of opportunities for those looking to enter the tech sector.</p>



<p>Huang noted that while creating opportunities is good, creating the culture and space for employees to take advantage of the initiatives is imperative. “A lot of people are also struggling to find time to learn because they feel very busy,” she said. “How can learning be part of the workday and to create a culture that motivates learning, and having X percentage of time devoted to failing and learning from it if it doesn&#8217;t succeed.”</p>



<p>Justus added, “A lot of people are experiencing a different challenge with their home or work situation and are looking to find ways to meet people where they are to keep a growth mindset at the forefront.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The one constant the panelists know for sure is to continue expecting the unexpected. </p>



<p>People that develop digital agility and continue future-proofing their skills will be well-positioned for long term success throughout their professional journeys.</p>

<p>After 12 weeks of accelerated learning, collaborating, and creating, BrainStation Diploma students are able to showcase everything they’ve accomplished at our Virtual Demo Day.</p>



<p>Here are some of our favorite projects from Winter 2020. Don’t forget to take a look at all of the latest graduate’s work on our <a href="https://brainstation.io/hiring-brainstation-graduates">Hiring BrainStation Graduates</a> page.</p>



<h2>A Yard Sale, For Those Without a Lawn</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IIEytz80KUySJrM4pAGT6kW3_gs_MgUJcgvHKeOolSkJZErdjiihXbd7E0j8AnJMCyz-PMPNPbdch8XNw-UdF1OzTz3ZYDBWhboKfTMKK7APnSmyzltHOSBpIimniKBhk9dZ45um" alt="Screenshot of the Rummage interface."/></figure>



<p>With the increased interest in supporting local businesses and sustainability, second-hand shopping is becoming a popular option for consumers and sellers.<br><br>Matt Lemche, Web Development, designed an app that allows people to sell their unwanted items in a virtual space that emulates the idea of a community yard sale.</p>



<p>Users of Rummage can either set up an online pop-up shop to make extra income off their unwanted items; or, they can search to find that hidden gem they’ve been thrifting for every weekend. Rummage is a new way to engage in e-commerce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2-1024x599.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12510" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2-1024x599.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2-300x175.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2-768x449.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2-1536x898.png 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2-960x561.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27121933/image2.png 1666w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2>IBD Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ek7lyOhiMBc0m-5laETYb-11CskCf0iI83p1hGG6bYa8-jCayVmBTOXurC9nCvqAzZ5p0pYmYxbjJjuNtfuvJD6G2Ad-BY6FXVAWLVgzTq539HRZ_4em9m3ZlFMLR9UNqSX-8oQb" alt="Collection of screen grabs about IBD Prediction."/></figure>



<p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects 1.6 million people in North America, with an average healthcare cost of 31 billion dollars annually.</p>



<p>Two known risk factors are a person’s diet and smoking habits. But genetics are the most influential indicators to help determine a person’s likelihood of having IBD. Samit crafted an algorithm that predicts the probability of developing IBD using a person&#8217;s DNA.</p>



<p>Samit Watve, Data Science, created a system capable of identifying risk to enable clinicians and researchers to collect genomic information from newborn babies, apply machine learning to the data, to generate a predictive risk model before any symptoms appear.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14-1024x557.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12511" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14-1024x557.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14-300x163.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14-768x417.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14-1536x835.png 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14-960x522.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122000/image14.png 1851w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2>Make Skincare a Breeze</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KndbSWFyAHxkF4tlk3RLelD3i5o5hiYvEsl4PL_wvU3ofhzw-xIO_APv_szXWtUL1AoU5obze6sd01VvBZucNrXC6dN-Oj2YMWfqePMr9hX1o9z45KDqAnh6BV_zjj9i9mVSg8tB" alt="Logo for Breeze Skincare"/></figure>



<p>There is an overwhelming amount of choices in the skincare industry as self-care continues to be a part of our daily conversations. Many brands market exclusively to women and focus on beauty rather than health, leaving many customers feeling confused about their complexions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alyssa Fan, Digital Marketing, created Breeze to focus on health before beauty, and to market to all genders who are looking to create or innovate their skin care routines.</p>



<p>Combining email marketing, social media and customer reviews, Breeze’s campaign looks to provide a holistic approach to build trust and help its customers win at healthy skin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11-1024x534.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12512" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11-1024x534.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11-300x156.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11-768x400.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11-1536x801.png 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11-960x500.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122220/image11.png 1913w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2>Put Students in the Lab, From Their Own Homes</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o2GQO7POkUfhmJ9_cGPx4565SkL3QY__IQbCs7_r6rC-1rJcVHLFxTg5YeukU6UUCwl1Smvx6S8eRuev23nOqrCxKIIEEDDdFdqqq3JkrTnf7fCn6Q0RZ-KTodsaIk7F5soW7Ti9" alt="Screenshot of the Volta app design"/></figure>



<p>Education continues to innovate at a rapid pace as the needs of our world continue to evolve. For science students, having limited time in a lab to learn and practice proper methods can prevent them from meeting course objectives. Kea Legard, User Experience Design, saw a digital solution.</p>



<p>Volta uses mobile VR and voice user interface (VUI) to allow students to master lab skills by manipulating lab equipment in a virtual environment when a lab is not accessible.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4-1024x593.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12513" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4-1024x593.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4-300x174.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4-768x445.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4-1536x890.png 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4-960x556.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122334/image4.png 1719w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2>Cleanse Your Palette-Making Process</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WE9eZmmjriOmYCIJGJ8GoAnNzIYsaf8JJs1obmTs2wuV2YMB8YcKeBfHFcRfwSfN1jU_VRd7HJbdkn4uysRBo9rwUmr6Xjy3gUFVYnB9fh2oPKqrkl7OhmGzpPOPXSG3j81E6Jfm" alt="Two examples of colour palettes created with the Palette app."/></figure>



<p>Whether creating a website, a presentation, or your artistic masterpiece, selecting the right colors to convey your message is essential. Ryan Vu, Web Development, wanted a simple space to get creative.</p>



<p>Palette is an interactive palette generator that allows creatives to generate and save custom color palettes in one accessible place. Drawing pads allow users to test how the colors work together and easily make adjustments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a web application and a desktop application, Palette wants to bring the play into your day to help you finish your projects.</p>

<h2>No More Fear from Food Allergies</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AZQXjBYjy9G2oa4Ilq6xn1X5XSkgoir0jTRrRV_A9ZJ3leFdHd8ZBHecwGxH_kXC3Sq4AQo5QwgUbcxzCBvXQ_cTTXjPPtKC_ANo0nOqCGrXQdvuTsNyvRUbOyFDWGtTYftkIubu" alt="Screenshot of REveal's Instagram post."/></figure>



<p>Between Canada and the U.S., over 35 million people are affected by at least one food allergy. Enjoying an evening dining out is often met with limitations and fear of having an allergic reaction. Stavroula Liovas, Digital Marketing, wanted a fun way to share information.</p>



<p>REveal looks to empower users to trust what they eat, no matter where they’re eating. Emphasizing a strong SEO campaign to drive awareness to frantic foodies looking for information, REveal’s campaign is focused on momentum and education to become top of mind to potential users.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1-1024x554.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12516" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1-1024x554.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1-300x162.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1-768x416.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1-1536x832.png 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1-960x520.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122556/image5-1.png 1910w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h2>Crowdsourced, Custom Gift-Giving</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VGVvDt9dHAbBLwP9cu9WEM_CAjKSkMTRmFXRm8uIPyEO4noe7F6e5p6JcJV0V4VKiVWjax4jC9qDriKJbe8Df482KnfieRAaXZGXF3Q_aup3XxJ2eO7ve0I7ThfGpQxOMxDsCgfI" alt="Screenshot of the interface for luxbux.com"/></figure>



<p>Buying a present for someone can be a stressful task, especially when the perfect gift is out of your price range. Receiving the wrong present can create an awkward situation if you’re uncomfortable asking for something else. Omar Said, Web Development, coded a custom wish list for this situation.</p>



<p>Luxbux is a website that allows for users to give money towards a specific present their loved one requested for their birthday or holiday. Focusing on higher-end goods, users have transparency about what gifts their loved ones want, and how they plan to spend the money given.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122621/image6-1024x602.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12517" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122621/image6-1024x602.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122621/image6-300x176.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122621/image6-768x451.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122621/image6-960x564.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/27122621/image6.png 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p><strong>How Digital Marketing Built These Brands</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on November 19 and featured leaders from <strong>Wave</strong>,<strong> Updater</strong>, and<strong> Better.com</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="How Digital Marketing Built These Brands" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/481468222?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re working on a new business or an established brand, digital marketing is now more essential than ever for continued growth. If you’re able to harness its powers and capabilities, you’ll be able to have long term gain over short term glamour.</p>



<p>We spoke with marketing experts from <strong>Wave</strong>, <strong>Updater</strong>, and <strong>Better.com</strong> to share their tips for identifying customers and growing your business, using the power of digital marketing and the plethora of digital strategies now available.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Leverage Free or Low Cost Tools</h2>



<p>Knowing where to invest your resources is a crucial step in your company’s growth, especially for new brands and entrepreneurs. One unanimous piece of advice for entrepreneurs from our panelists is to explore your options when it comes to identifying and defining your marketing and competitors.</p>



<p>Melanie Dodge, Director of Marketing at Better.com, recommends using low-cost tools to understand the search behaviors of your customers and the interests and needs of your leads.</p>



<p>“Your customers are your best tools. They will tell you what they&#8217;re thinking and that can also inform strategy,” says Dodge, adding that conducting surveys and tracking the search patterns of your customers and competitors are great places to start.</p>



<p>Being aware of your competitors is essential, particularly when it comes to something like developing bidding strategies –&nbsp;they may have access to significantly larger budgets. Jenna Weinerman, VP of Marketing at Updater offers a cost-effective tip.</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re marketing, you don&#8217;t have to bid or advertise. You can create content to answer the questions of what they&#8217;re searching for,” Weinerman says. “Say something relevant and powerful,” as a creative solution for smart search spending on a small budget.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Invest In SEO (and be Patient)</h2>



<p>The ability to put the right content in front of the right eyes at the right time is what makes Search Engine Optimization (SEO) a go-to tool for digital marketers.</p>



<p>“SEO is something that we&#8217;ve really doubled down on and I&#8217;m a really big believer in not just ranking for the traffic, but actually adding something of value,” says Dodge.</p>



<p>Sarah Bugeja, Director of Demand Generation at Wave, agrees, explaining that SEO needs to complement your content strategy. “It is incredibly important from an organic point of view to build meaningful content that serves the needs of what people are looking for and anchoring it also with brand friendly content.”</p>



<p>Bugeja also notes that in order to see success with SEO, get comfortable with playing the long game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not something you do today and you&#8217;re going to see amazing results tomorrow. There is some patience to be had, especially depending on the vertical that you&#8217;re playing in&#8230;and it may take you longer to index, meaning to show up higher [in organic search results],” says Bugeja.</p>

<h2>Use Content to Build Your Brand</h2>



<p>In our previous Digital Leadership Event Series panel, <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/the-new-rules-of-marketing-creating-stand-out-content">The New Rules of Marketing: Creating Stand-Out Content</a>, maximizing your content was a key takeaway. When you have limited access to tools or tricks for new content creation, investing in larger pieces with dynamic content that can be divided and delivered across several platforms is a smart use of resources, rather than speeding through several, smaller, specific pieces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Spend the extra time to actually add value and go past getting the traffic there. So whether it&#8217;s putting a visual in an animation and video, recycle and make your content work for you. Don&#8217;t do double the job,” says Dodge, recommending&nbsp; a more scientific approach to measurement, not only for top of funnel metrics, but when looking at the trickle down effect of your marketing initiatives.</p>



<p>“Maybe a [Call to Action] or an ad is driving a lot of clicks and orders, but is it ultimately driving to that conversion goal?”</p>



<p>Informed consumers look for quality content to build their long term brand loyalty, but advocating for it while balancing quarterly targets can be a challenge when speaking with different stakeholders and connecting content strategy to the overall organizational goals.</p>



<p>“You need proof points,” says Weinerman. Qualitative measurements such as surveys, customer comments, public relations, and articles are strong points to build an arsenal that can pay off in the long run in building brand credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re in it for the quick win in B2B, it&#8217;s really easy to be forgotten. So I tend to put more emphasis on the brand because I want to build a really memorable brand experience for our clients rather than one conversion at a time, because they&#8217;re not going to be with us for that one conversion. That&#8217;s the beginning of their journey with us,” says Weinerman.</p>



<p>Long-term relationship building requires showing your customers consistent value and adding features that can make their lives easier throughout their life cycle with your organization. In order to maximize your efforts, collaborating with people from different teams can align company goals, and generate multi-platform solutions.</p>



<h2>Leverage Cross-Functional Teams </h2>



<p>Working with other departments allows for more actionable, informed insights. Cohesive, cross-functional teams with key players is one way marketers are leveraging internal skill sets to turn key learnings into meaningful performance.</p>



<p>Dodge says that a critical investment Better.com made was hiring a director of Product of Growth and establishing a growth committee made up of their product, marketing, design, and data teams. “Through that we have really established a test-and-learn approach to everything we do when it comes to digital marketing.”</p>



<p>Bugeja credits working with her data team as a key asset to Wave’s marketing strategy. “Working with our data science team to understand campaign performance has really improved our ability to execute on paid search super efficiently when we understand what is actually driving the best kinds of acquisition,” she says, adding that one final piece of advice for new businesses and entrepreneurs, “don’t be afraid of the word pivot.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, our experts strive to blend strategies, tools, and teams that will work together to convert outstanding, long-lasting customers. By integrating the measurable and meaningful content, businesses will often see cost-effective, sustained performance growth.<br></p>

<p><strong>Building Digital Loyalty Programs That Work </strong>– the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on November 5th, and featured three experts from McDonald’s Canada, Brooklinen, and Ritual Vitamins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476406905" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>The humble loyalty programs of yesteryear – the era of “buy nine subs, get your tenth sub free” – have come a long way in the digital age. Today, consumers have many more ways to interact with brands, including in bricks-and-mortar stores and pop-up locations, curbside and delivery, on websites and social media, and through newsletters and SMS. Each of these touchpoints represents an opportunity to implement a loyalty program with the goal of gleaning valuable data and, ultimately, driving consumer habits.</p>



<p>We spoke with three executives overseeing ambitious and highly diverse loyalty programs – for McDonald’s Canada, Brooklinen, and Ritual Vitamins – about how loyalty programs are changing, how they can be a key driver of customer experience and customer insights, and their best advice for making a loyalty program work.</p>



<h2><strong>Every Loyalty Program Is Unique</strong></h2>



<p>Unsurprisingly, different brands need different things from their loyalty programs. One of the key determiners here is the timescale at which purchases are made.</p>



<p>At McDonald’s Canada, for instance, Digital Director Adam Cooper oversees a loyalty program to drive daily purchases, which grew from an offline rewards card where every coffee purchased earned a sticker. “A few years ago, we replicated the paper program within our mobile app,” Cooper says. “Results are strong. And when you couple it with something like a reorder feature, which increases the habitual nature and the ease of coming to McDonald’s, the value proposition is pretty strong.”</p>



<p>Allie Donovan is Director of Email and Retention at Brooklinen, a D2C provider of bed linens and other homewares; unlike at McDonald’s, her customers may go months or even years between purchases, meaning “loyalty” needs to be measured differently. For&nbsp; Donovan, loyalty is less about habitual behaviors and more about building a strong relationship. “We think that relationships have to be the very center of the marketing that we do,” she says. “We have to acknowledge that our customers are helping us – we’re very grateful for their business and we have to give them something in return.”</p>



<p>Loyalty also looks completely different at Ritual Vitamins, where everything is retailed through a subscription model. As Director of Customer Lifecycle and Growth Laura Brodie explains, repeat sales are built into the subscription plan, so the goals of the loyalty program are very different: “We look at our customer lifecycle on a monthly basis, based on how long they’ve been subscribed, and we do lots of research as to what questions our customers have at what point in their tenure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because loyalty programs are bespoke, they always begin with research – ROI being a prime consideration – and clear objectives. How do you define “loyalty”? What is your priority – retention, higher average order value (AOV), more customers? And are you sure you know what your customer hopes to get out of it?</p>



<p>Depending on the market, “there could be years between purchases,” says Donovan. “We had to think about the signals that tell us you’re a loyal customer. Frequency and AOV can be very interconnected. But there are also signals like, are you coming to our site? Are you looking at the information we give you? We really think about retention and loyalty as one.”</p>



<p>Your definition of loyalty will shape your program in many ways. Some programs, like the typical points system, are highly visible to the customer. But some programs operate in the background. “As you’re there longer, you’re getting rewarded,” Donovan explains. “Even though you may not know it, you’re seeing surprise and delight offers come through, not knowing that you’ve earned them because you’ve ordered a certain number of times. Some people really want that challenge of points and rewards, and others want to be much more passive – but they still want to be acknowledged.”</p>



<p>Especially in long-timescale programs, there may be a temptation to reward bad behaviors in an attempt to entice customers to reactivate – but this should be approached carefully. “We want to keep the relationship between what we pay for a customer and their lifetime value in check,” Brodie says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The solution is to find incentives that work for your specific customer base – which could be as simple as a customized product recommendation, demonstrating that you understand their needs. There are many ways to appeal to your customers besides discounts: exclusive offers, content or events open to members only, including programming or a house publication, or pre-sale access to high-demand products; convenience, like the ability to pay through an app rather than waiting in line; bonus offers like free embroidery or engraving on a purchased item; free samples or gifts; and personalized or tailored content.</p>



<p>In fact, one way to boost loyalty is to incorporate customer feedback into your product development cycle – showing them their input is valued while also making your products more appealing to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>UX at The Core of Loyalty Programs</strong></h2>



<p>All the touchpoints mentions above – physical stores, curbside and delivery, online and social channels, email newsletters and SMS – correspond to a different stage of the customer journey, and as such, are part of the same UX.</p>



<p>“The power is in the consumer’s hands,” Donovan says, “whereas 10 or 20 years ago, they just didn’t have the choices that are available now, everybody really is your competitor. A bank is something very different from the homeware sheet business – but you might go to a bank’s website, and they have smooth transitions from all their pages and you can get exactly what you want done. When you have a great experience like that, you suddenly expect it from everybody. If anyone is clunky and old-fashioned, it jars with you.”</p>



<p>Experience is key not only to attracting repeat customers, but also to building trust – whose importance to growing a business can’t be overstated. As Brodie explains, “We equate trust with loyalty. And trust is based on so many things, especially with a product in the health space. Once you earn that trust, you unlock the ability to do a lot of different things in your customer experience. When we get customers to trust us, it means that, one, they’ll stay with their habit. But two, they’ll look for more and more from our brand. That’s what loyalty really is.”</p>



<p>In other words, loyalty programs are not just a carrot to entice customers to spend. They’re about building relationships by showing customers that you value both their business and their feedback, and being responsive to what customers want from your business. This also relates back to incentives: some customers are looking for a monetary reward, but community-building and showing customers they’re being heard can be equally powerful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A loyalty program can reward far more than just making purchases, too. Donovan explains, “We designed our program in a way where you earn points for everything that you buy, as well as for some of the other activities that we want you to take, maybe liking us on Instagram or giving us your birthday – things that are very good indicators of your loyalty.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, there are several ways loyalty programs can teach you more about its members.</p>



<h2><strong>Loyalty Programs Provide Customer Insights</strong></h2>



<p>Besides incentivizing specific behaviors – both habitual ones as well as one-time actions like completing a survey or writing a review – there are at least three ways a loyalty program can yield insights about customer behavior: once when the points are earned, again when the points are redeemed, and finally, when customer behaviors are analyzed in aggregate.</p>



<p>The first phase, when the customer is racking up points by completing different rewarded behaviors, reveals what actions a customer is taking (or not taking), giving you a window into where there’s room for growth. “We get some really interesting trend lines on transactions, retention and habitual use,” Cooper explains. “If we see you buying coffee every day, but we see that you never use the reorder function on the app, maybe we can start sending emails to say, ‘Hey, have you seen this feature? Have you seen the value? You can now get your coffee in four clicks.’ Similar to if we see you buy Happy Meals but you never use curbside service for mobile ordering.”</p>



<p>The way points are redeemed can also be a window into customers’ values. Once you’ve earned points with Brooklinen, Donovan says, “you can spend them in three ways: you can redeem them for a coupon, you can exchange them for a free item –different levels, different amounts, and you can have lots of different items – or you can donate your points to Habitat for Humanity New York, which is a really nice way to give back and have the customer feel that they’re being part of the charity effort.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these touchpoints are opportunities to peer into the mindset of individual customers. But taken in aggregate, these behaviors can also reveal new patterns in statistical data. “We get top-line, high-level data on just how many people are engaging with our digital experience and our loyalty programs,” Cooper says. “Where we go from there is retention and turning profitability on for every offer, and the programs at large. When you can do the math on that, it really is a huge opportunity. Especially during the pandemic, when we’ve had to close the inside of some restaurants, there’s been an opportunity in how loyalty can help – knowing the customer can actually help us to get them into a curbside spot or open up mobile ordering to them. Having that relationship with our guests, knowing a little bit about them, has allowed us to see where we can convert to help drive the business.”</p>



<p>Brodie confirms the value of this data. “We recently went through and audited our survey process to make sure that we really were learning about the customer at every stage, and not having it really loaded toward onboarding, for example. We look at tons of different touchpoints, and then we can also look at engagement within their account. Are they snoozing their order, are they changing their delivery date? Are they taking an active role in managing their subscription?” This can feed directly into top-level business strategy: “We work super collaboratively with our product and data teams, as well as our customer insights team. The main starting point is, what are we learning about our customers at each stage? Then we’ll take survey data and match it with the behavioral data we’re seeing in terms of product usage and metrics like retention. Only once we bring all of those pieces together do we try to formulate recommendations, and that will go into the development of more formal features and things that the product team would work on.”</p>



<p>“I always think of a retention and customer relationship management team like a central hub of the company,” Donovan adds, emphasizing the importance of these insights to all levels of a business. “Everyone either wants something from you or you need something from them. It’s at the center of what everyone’s doing.”</p>

<p>The<strong> Women in Leadership: Shaping Stronger Pathways </strong>panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on June 11th, and professionals around the world tuned in to discuss the challenges women face in the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/428532819" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>While career opportunities for women have increased over the years, women are underrepresented at every level in the corporate pipeline, but especially in senior leadership; Only 21 percent of C-suite positions are filled by women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A study by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org found that for every 100 men promoted or hired at the manager level, only 72 women were hired or promoted to manager. The gender difference is so great that researchers claim this first step up to manager –&nbsp;often referred to as the “broken rung” –&nbsp;is the biggest obstacle women face on the path to senior leadership positions, with women in marginalized communities facing multiple broken rungs.</p>



<p>There are, however, a number of initiatives organizations can take to strengthen and diversify their talent pipeline and shape stronger pathways for women into leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Help Close the Confidence Gap</h2>



<p>A survey of British Managers found that half the female respondents reported self-doubt in their job, compared with fewer than a third of male respondents. Another study found that men overestimate their abilities and performance, while women underestimate both. This has a direct correlation with career advancement, as women are 26 percent less likely to ask for a job referral than men, even when they are qualified. As per the oft-quoted stat: Men apply for a job if they meet 60 percent of the qualifications, while women will only apply if they meet 100 percent of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Women are often taught that we need to be humble and silent about our accomplishments. We have a lot of fear when it comes to speaking up and asking for the things that we deserve, but rather than having that fear, we need to have the audacity to put our hands up, ask for referrals, apply for roles we might not have all the qualifications for,” Danica S. Nelson, a Senior Marketing Communications Manager at Telus said, adding that it’s important to acknowledge and share the effects of <em>imposter syndrome</em>.</p>



<p>“I face imposter syndrome on a weekly basis, and we need to make it very clear to people who see us on panels or in leadership positions that hey, I’m afraid a lot of the time too, I’m not 100 percent confident,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Catherine Hunter, the Advisory Partner and Technology Transformation Leader at EY, believes there are a number of things organizations can do to help women close the “confidence gap” that may be fueling imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve probably all felt imposter syndrome at some point in our career, but there are lots of little things organizations can do to help. This concept of exec presence, and helping people feel more confident when they’re in a room with others in terms of how you present, how you speak, the content of the material, those sorts of things can help people if they feel they may need more support,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hunter also suggests senior leaders provide opportunities to boost the confidence of their more junior colleagues. </p>



<p>“Offering people opportunities where they feel they can succeed in turn helps build confidence,” she said explaining that confidence can help employees turn their ideas into action.</p>



<h2>Let Go of Perfect</h2>



<p>Numerous studies have shown that women in the workplace often ruminate over their own mistakes, leading to stress levels that are up to 67 percent higher than men.&nbsp;“These are the pressures you place on yourself,” Clinical Psychologist Dr. Jessamy Hibberd, Co-Author of <em>This Book Will Make You Calm</em>, told the Guardian. “For example, checking and rechecking work, spending too long on each task, taking work home, and setting excessively high standards.”</p>



<p>An organization’s culture, and paradoxically, a focus on finding the optimal work-life balance may be increasing the pressure women impose on themselves. When asked about balancing work and life and setting the tone for her team, Tonia O’Connor, CEO of Chopra Global said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t believe in balance. Balance suggests perfection and perfection is not achievable. I don’t want anyone to think it is because you’ll continue to strive for that and feel inadequate. I always say I’m perfectly out of balance.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That imperfection, in fact, might be an advantage. Monika Saksena, the Director, Global Partnerships and Tools at Google, argues that women should continue to tap into their more reflective nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think one asset we have as women is vulnerability. We can bring our whole selves more easily, so I think being open and being transparent and bringing our whole selves to work sets the tone,” she said.</p>



<h2>Encourage Mentorship and Sponsorship </h2>



<p>Saksena believes that providing mentorship opportunities can help strengthen pathways for women in leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Peer mentorship is essential. The value of talking to someone in the same boat and figuring those stories out is huge,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is, however, important to remember that mentorship is a two-way street.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just because you might be a junior exec in an organization, don’t think that you don’t have mentorship or something to offer to executives who might be above you, especially living in the digital times,” said O’Connor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everyone has a role to play as a teacher and as a student.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>O’Connor argues that sponsorship – where a senior colleague advocates for junior or women employees and supports their growth – may be just as important as mentorship.</p>



<p>“Men are often promoted on their potential when women are promoted on their track record and demonstrated success. So it’s important to sponsor women, even if they don’t check all the boxes for desired roles,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encouraging a culture of sponsorship, however, can be challenging. Many employees look to company leaders to set the tone, but what steps can they take?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A big part of my leadership role is to challenge male counterparts on active sponsorship of underrepresented individuals in our organizations,” said Serena Nguyen, the Director, Talent&nbsp;Experience and Strategy at MaRS Discovery District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re putting yourself out there and challenging the status quo. It’s a difficult and uncomfortable conversation sometimes, but if you anchor it in respect and the facts of what you&#8217;re seeing, it goes a long way to bring others into this journey of sponsorship,” she said.</p>



<p>Danica Nelson of Telus agrees but also encourages women to continue self-advocating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve just learned that we have to be our own cheerleader and our own PR team because we won&#8217;t always have people to speak up for us. We really have to take on that role and pick up the mic ourselves sometimes,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hunter echoed the sentiment, reflecting on what she might have done differently in her first Manager role. “I could have asked more questions and sought out mentors,” she said, adding that if there is a bright side, it’s that women now have more resources available to them – and it’s only increasing with time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m seeing more supportive networks and groups where women can come together, speak openly and candidly, seek out mentors, and also seek out sponsors.”</p>



<p>The future, after all, is female.  </p>

<p>While career opportunities for women have increased dramatically over the years, representation in the C-suite is far from parity, with only 21 percent of positions filled by women. At what point does this gap occur and why? And how do we work together, across generations and leadership levels, to create stronger pathways for women in the workplace?</p>



<p>Join BrainStation for a cross-generational conversation with industry leaders to explore these questions and discuss the ways we can continue on the road to equality. <a href="https://brainstation.io/event/online-women-in-leadership-june2020">Sign Up</a>&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Scrapping the Roadmap: Navigating Products Through Change</strong>, a BrainStation Digital Leadership event, attracted thousands of professionals around the world eager to understand how brands were managing products and product development in a crisis. </p>



<p>You can watch the panel event here: </p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/421629191" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>Here are some tips on how to navigate product development and management through periods of change. &nbsp;</p>



<h2>Be Able (and Willing) to Change Mindset</h2>



<p>Over the last few months, brands across industries have had to adjust product roadmaps, and they’ve often had to do that at light speed. Maria Potoroczyn, from Citi, explained how COVID-19 forced the company to completely redefine its product roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s May 21st and we’re basically done with what we initially had on our roadmap for 2020. So, we&#8217;ve had to define the path forward from scratch,” she said. </p>



<p>Daryl Porter, from Walmart, described how the company quickly shifted focus to boost its delivery service. </p>



<p>“We rallied the entire organization around building capacity very fast – adding pickers, ramping up delivery infrastructure – there was a lot of operational focus there, and on the digital side we had to make sure we could enable that. We gathered Product Managers and Engineers and brought them all together in a “tiger team” to allow for decisions to be made quickly,” Porter said.</p>



<h2>Focus on Prioritization</h2>



<p>Given the pace of change, prioritization of initiatives has been fundamental to organizations across industries. Michael Ayoola, from The New York Times, explained how the media organization has delayed more experimental initiatives (involving AI and machine learning) to focus on projects that would provide more immediate value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Advertising has taken a hit, so growth and engagement have been the focus,” he said, explaining that The Times has allowed free access to content related to COVID-19, and provided removed paywalls for high school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel agreed on the need for planning flexibility, but Porter added that Walmart has been careful to maintain a long-term lens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We tried not to build functionality that would have no place in a post-COVID world,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Data is King (But Trust Your Instincts)</h2>



<p>Over the last few months, key metrics have shifted and they continue to change. This has increased the importance of remote user testing.</p>



<p>“Drivers of satisfaction have dramatically changed. What was important before isn’t necessarily important now,” Porter said, adding that while data remains essential, not having all the information is okay too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of our decisions are based on 70 percent data and 30 percent instinct – and that&#8217;s okay, Usually we’d be a lot higher on the data side, but by being a little less risk-averse, we were able to do it.”</p>



<p>Potoroczyn explained that despite occasional gaps in data, the last few months have reminded organizations how products and product roadmaps <em>should</em> be managed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been such a tangible example and reaffirmation of some of the great principles of product management: stay close to the customer and in sync with their needs, understand your technical limitations, and make sure you understand the tradeoffs of all the other things you choose not to do,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BrainStation’s most recent online panel discussion – <strong>Future of Retail: Succeeding in an Online-Only World</strong>&nbsp; – was another rousing success, with thousands of professionals tuning in from around the globe.</p>



<p>As always, Ian Bester, BrainStation’s Vice-President and GM, hosted the panel of retail executives, which included:</p>



<ul><li>Nicole West, VP Digital Strategy and Product at Chipotle Mexican Grill</li><li>Shimona Mehta, Head of EMEA, Shopify Plus</li><li>Deborah Honig, the Head of Nike Direct EMEA West</li></ul>



<p>The panel agreed that the COVID-19 outbreak has increased the speed of digitization, with many of the retailers succeeding now only doubling down on existing digital strategies. </p>



<p>Nicole West, of Chipotle, discussed how the company has in the past worked hard to fuse the digital and in-store experience, asking themselves, “How we can bring the digital experience into our brick and mortar restaurants? Engagement, payments, and rewards –&nbsp;those are the three areas where we can really bring digital to life,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shimona Mehta, of Shopify Plus, added that given the increased demand for online retail, brands have to work hard to create great digital experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;My advice to growing businesses is to be remarkable: think about your brand story and why customers would purchase from you over someone else. You must also create frictionless checkout experience, which includes offering the appropriate payment options, to increase conversion,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel also agreed that a data-driven approach is now fundamental to product roadmaps and marketing decisions, and a greater focus on digital channels will only increase data&#8217;s importance.</p>



<p>&#8220;What most excites me about the future is our chance to serve consumers even better. By getting people engaged in digital platforms, we get to know them better and are able to serve up more personalized content,&#8221; said Deborah Honig of Nike. </p>
