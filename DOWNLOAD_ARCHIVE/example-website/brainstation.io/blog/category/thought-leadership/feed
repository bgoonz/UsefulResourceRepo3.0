<p>Miami&#8217;s Digital Future: Success in 2021 and Beyond – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 24, and featured four of Miami&#8217;s tech titans from <strong>Softbank Group International</strong>, <strong>Cisneros</strong>, and <strong>aïre ventures</strong>, and special guest Francis Suarez, <strong>Mayor of Miami</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/528967739" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Miami’s digital landscape has exploded over the past few years, especially in 2020 as global companies continue to tap into Miami’s unique ecosystem of highly-qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>Our Vice President and General Manager of BrainStation Miami, Johanna Mikkola, connected with Leigh-Ann Buchanan from <strong>aïres ventures</strong>, Adriana Cisneros, Chief Executive Officer at <strong>Cisneros</strong>, Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at <strong>SoftBank Group International</strong>, and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, to discuss how Miami can capitalize on this unique moment to ensure prosperity for businesses and tech talent.</p>



<h2>Turning Miami Into a Tech Hub</h2>



<p>During an active moment on social media, where people were discussing the possible future for tech in Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez typed four words that would shift the conversation for good: How can I help?</p>



<p>“I had no expectation that it would be the kind of viral sensation that it was,” said Suarez about his offer to help promote technological growth in the city. “We have been trying to systematically create a tech ecosystem in Miami for the past 10 years. Changing the reputation of a city is like moving a cruise ship&#8230;. I felt like I went out there and got a bunch of tugboats and just dropped them onto the cruise ship and just turned it as fast as I could.”</p>



<p>Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at Softbank International Group, recently moved to Miami himself, and is excited about what the city has to offer. “We kind of understand that when you have a confluence of technological shifts and geography that&#8217;s ready, you get really explosive outcomes.”</p>



<p>“It’s been fun to see when you have a lot of smart people living in the same area,” said Adriana Cisneros, CEO of Cisneros. “The local initiatives, universities, and professors who are in touch and very smart people wanting to help up [Miami’s] game.”<br></p>



<h2>Be Intentional With Inclusivity</h2>



<p>With the increased buzz around South Florida’s budding entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is then the issue of accessibility for those wanting to participate. Leigh-Ann Buchanan emphasized that diversity, equity, and inclusion opportunities don’t happen by accident. They require intentional and frequent communications in order to design the right solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is so much that we can do,” Cisneros added. “There is the notion of inspiring by example. We shouldn’t do things to tick boxes, we should do them because they’re good for business and are the right thing to do.”</p>



<p>“We have a blank canvas as we grow the ecosystem at a feverish pace,” said Suarez. “But to create an equal playing field is to empower particularly children&#8230;and adults who are supposed to have the same set of tools. We need to support organizations that are working and creating opportunities in an equitable fashion and Miami has the opportunity to get it right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the needs and the current technical abilities, there are, however, a few gaps that need to be addressed to support the growth Miami has the potential to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no talent gap, but there is a skills gap,” said Nyatta. “[Softbank is] focused on bridging that digital skills gap in Miami. But there is also a permission gap, as ecosystems that are centred around entrepreneurship often don’t give permission for young people to take risks. This has been the secret sauce of Silicon Valley, giving people permission to screw up and unlocking that permission is the most powerful thing a person can do for growth.”</p>



<p>With post-graduate programs focused on providing digital skills training and Miami becoming a study destination for students, Cisneros is excited to see what is in store for the next wave of workers.</p>



<p>“Miami is still a new city. I’ve heard people say it’s like a silly putty in that you can shape it into what you want it to be. People want to hear about what you&#8217;re working on. Compared to other cities, it&#8217;s genuinely welcoming and you don’t need to have money or power to be accepted into a group you&#8217;re interested in.”<br></p>



<h2>Embrace the Global Yet Local Opportunities</h2>



<p>Buchanan described Miami as a visionary city in what it can support and what people can bring into the community. As it relates to digital talent, Mayor Francis acknowledged there is more than training alone that needs to be done to further Miami’s digital future.</p>



<p>“Our infrastructure [needs to] keep pace with the growth that we’re innovating,” he said. “We obviously want to focus on continuing to make Miami affordable, not just through public private partnerships on affordable housing, but making sure that we have continued supply of housing and which thankfully we do.”</p>



<p>Physical infrastructure plans have also included having direct flights to Asia, which would make Miami one of the most accessible American cities.</p>



<p>Nyatta noted, “A lot of the Miami talk has been about Miami and the U.S: Miami versus Silicon Valley, Miami versus Austin. The discussion I haven&#8217;t heard as much, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s happening is Miami is a global metropolis&#8230;Miami is Hong Kong. Miami is Singapore. Miami is Dubai. It is a culturally situated city with very powerful cultural dynamics that are super interesting and unique and specific and authentic with global potential, with a global airport, with global access.”</p>



<p>With his sights on international connections, Mayor Francis is already thinking ahead on how Miami can get involved with the next generation of verticals such as deep machine learning, Cryptocurrencies, and HealthTech.</p>



<p>“We want to be positioned to be the city that is most forward thinking,” he said. “What that means is as our children grow, they have permission to dream, succeed, and fail and have the ecosystem to support that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think this focus on talent is important,” said Cisneros. “Of course good companies always attract talent, but it&#8217;s also very cool to be able to grow the talent from the 305. It’s good for them and it’s good for the city.”</p>



<p>Nyatta noted that while the energy and excitement is excellent fuel, there needs to be continued strategy year over year to solidify the success Miami is poised to achieve.</p>



<p>“This is not even a marathon, it&#8217;s like an ultra marathon. Maintaining intention and strategic clarity over decades is actually the trick, not just a couple of quarters of buzz. Finding ways to build that intentionality into institutions that outlast political cycles, that outlast fund lives is the trick. I think trying to embed these ideas as much as we can into things that will outlive us is the task at hand rather than let&#8217;s just create a lot of attention right now.”</p>



<p>Mayor Suarez agreed, adding that an effective long-term plan starts with preparing Miamians for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The truth that we all understand is tech is here to stay. If we want to create an equitable economy, we need to provide the right tools and opportunities for people to access those tools.”<br></p>

<p><strong>Stepping Up: Canada’s Next Digital Chapter </strong>– the final installment in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s 2020 Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on December 3 and featured leaders from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Hootsuite</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>EY,</strong> and <strong>Rogers Communications</strong>.</p>

<p>Canada’s digital landscape has exploded over the past two decades, with home-grown companies claiming their rightful place on the world stage. Meanwhile, global companies continue to tap into Canada’s unique ecosystem of highly qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>We spoke with technology experts from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Hootsuite</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>EY,</strong> and <strong>Rogers Communications</strong> to share insights about what makes Canada a place for thriving business, and what Canada can do to continue fostering homegrown talent.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Pivot From Resources to Resourcefulness&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Elana Chan, Head of B2B Marketing at Google agrees with the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, that Canada is shifting from a resource-based economy, to a resourcefulness based economy.</p>



<p>More than 97 percent of the Canadian economy is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB), making them the backbone of the economy today. The ability for SMBs to become more digitally savvy with search engine optimization and social media will become essential to reach an international audience and continue growing.</p>



<p>“Fewer than 10 percent of our SMB export. Yet we know that those that do grow two times faster than others,” said Chan.</p>



<p>Chan continued, “We&#8217;re one of the only G7 countries with trade agreements with all the other G7 countries. So we have all the conditions to export more Canadian goods.”</p>



<p>Adapting to the given circumstances and pursuing new opportunities is a resilience woven deep into the Canadian identity. This is continuously tested as large firms pivot to stay connected and relevant in the minds of consumers.</p>



<p>“Competition is coming from everywhere, even from non-traditional competitors with the big tech firms entering into non-traditional sectors that they weren&#8217;t originally playing in, like financial services. Legacy brands are now finding ways to go direct-to-consumer rather than playing the B2B game,” said Stephen Megitt, Executive Strategy Director at EY.</p>



<p>Despite the evolving strategies from the heavily resourced firms, Megitt sees Canada’s big opportunity to stave off competition coming from entrepreneurial pursuits. “There&#8217;s a lot of small tech startups that are now competing against larger ones. This is primarily fuelled by a strong entrepreneurial environment within Canada.”</p>



<p>Jon de la Mothe, Vice President, Ad Product and Operations for Rogers Communications, has seen the technological transformations Canada has undergone over the past decades. When assessing Canada’s current position against international competitors, “We&#8217;re not playing catch up anymore,” he said.</p>



<p>Tom Keiser, CEO at Hootsuite embraces the disruption that is on the horizon. “We&#8217;re the dominant players. Some of [the panelist companies] are in dominant positions, and have been now for over a decade and we are going to get disrupted. Just like we&#8217;ve been disrupting those before us. The acceleration of disruption with the acceleration of technologies is going to be the norm.”</p>



<p>“We should probably all stop calling it digital transformation and just call it transformation or business transformation,” said Megitt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations are making investments into technology and bringing experiences to life in a matter of weeks that previously would have taken months or years to complete. This requires a workforce and culture with significant agility to tackle the challenge of a compressed innovation cycle, and the opportunity that it can offer.</p>



<p>Leanne Gibson, Head of Industry at Facebook &amp; Instagram Canada said, “We see an urgent imperative for brands to accelerate the pace of e-commerce adoption in Canada and frankly, around the world. With that, skills are required.”</p>



<p>“Every company now is a digital company,” said Chan. “That&#8217;s the only way to succeed, and digital skills are going to be the rising tide that raises all ships.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Raise Your Hand to Reskill</h2>



<p>As industries shift, there is a growing disconnect between available skills and available positions.</p>



<p>“We now are fighting for the same talent across industries,” said Megitt. “When you introduce this new context and [way of] doing things, every single company is now looking to have the same set of players on their team that can focus more in design thinking, human centered design, and UX.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Demand is already outstripping supply across product, across design, across engineering in Canada,” said Keiser. “As the public cloud continues to evolve and really everything becomes digitized and digital products, the demand for being able to bring that cohesively together into a design and aesthetic that is easy, navigable and delightful&#8230;only becomes more and more important. Having that foundational set of skills becomes more important than ever for the success of anyone working in the digital space.”</p>



<p>Chan sees Canada’s success over the next 10 years linked to how well we retrain existing workers, “I don&#8217;t think we can leave people behind here. The digital divide is going to be really real and problematic if we cannot have basic digital skills for a wider population.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For professionals mid-career, changing track and learning new digital skills can be destabilizing. Chan, however, believes that you should not discount your current skill set. Rather, lean into your experience and transferable skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in tech for a while, and there are a lot of transversal skills that we&#8217;re looking for, that people in more traditional, quote unquote, industries have,&#8221; Chan said, adding that you sometimes just have to take a risk. &#8220;You have to make the jump, which is a little bit scary because it&#8217;s unknown. But a lot of these traditional companies hire very smart people. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking for [in tech].&#8221;</p>



<p>De la Mothe championed the proactive people that saw their roles evolve from where they started 20 years ago. “The folks that started first to begin that upskilling, cross-skilling are the ones that raised their hands and wanted to learn.”</p>



<p>Megitt sees the global value that Canadian talent offers, but that it will take foresight from Canadian-based companies to create the right kind of environment to keep talent invested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Companies all over the world are looking to grab talent from anywhere, because that&#8217;s the way that we work now.” He continued, “We as Canadians have to create the right short-term and long-term opportunities to help keep the talent here and keep introducing and innovating new technology, new products within those experiences.”</p>



<p>Fostering tech talent goes beyond the current pool of potential workers, Megitt sees the need for collaboration between social institutional structures like education and government to prepare emerging talent for the job market that has yet to be created.</p>



<p>“It can’t start when they get a job. It needs to start early on in life to expose them to STEM and to expose them to careers that they thought weren’t for them. We need to work with [academia and] the government more to create incentives and programs that will train and nurture tech talent, and give them a reason beyond just the job to stay [in Canada] and continue to work and develop the fabric of Canadians.”&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Adapt Alongside Users and Employees</h2>



<p>With human-centred experiences being emphasized in almost every industry, Megitt notes that offering opportunities to lift others up is a strength that companies should be leveraging to create a more well-adapted, strengthened workforce.</p>



<p>“When everyone has opportunities to contribute and you have a diverse perspective and you have a diverse workforce, you&#8217;re going to generate great quality products and experiences.”</p>



<p>Chan said, “As we grow, as we&#8217;re getting more Canadian talent and we&#8217;re reskilling, I think we have to really be thoughtful of great representation across the board.”</p>



<p>“[Canadians] are all really proud of our multicultural society that we live in. At Google, we think about how important it is to be representative of our users. You can&#8217;t be representative of your users if your teams and values aren&#8217;t also reflecting those views,” she continued.</p>



<p>Keiser spoke to how brands and organizations need to assess their values and to actively reflect them through all experiences as consumers become more value-focused. “They are really thinking about who they want to do business with. They want to do business with entities that they&#8217;re aligned with on values.”</p>



<p>Megitt referred to Michael Bierut’s definition of a brand as not something a company creates; rather, it is created by the people that give the brand meaning. “How a consumer interacts with a brand is the meaning that is going to be associated with that brand. So ultimately, experience becomes brand. How [your company] goes about creating those experiences for your customers or for your employees will ultimately ascribe the value to the brand that you have.”</p>



<p>Social media has become a common method to connect brand and identity in order to build the one-to-one relationship and engage with their customers. In a year that has been dominated by change, Keiser advised that social listening is a skill all leaders need to utilize and continuously develop.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve seen a lot of big brands and companies make tremendous missteps by not listening and trying to dominate a conversation as opposed to really listening and participating in a conversation.”</p>



<p>“If we all put ourselves in the consumer&#8217;s shoes, we know our expectations are higher than they&#8217;ve ever been and that is not going to change, said Gibson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timely information has never been more relevant than in the digital age and the explosion of ecommerce. Companies are expected to be constantly in tune to the customer needs and deliver personalized, immediate experiences to the consumer.</p>



<p>“Consumers expect all brands to be omnichannel and to have a frictionless commerce experience wherever they go,” she added. “If they don&#8217;t get it, they will leave.” Despite this expectation, only 40 percent of Canadian businesses have an ecommerce website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With many opportunities being left on the table, businesses should be designing experiences with data-driven decisions and leveraging technology in a much better way.</p>



<p>“Customer expectations have evolved, employee expectations and evolved,” added Megitt. “Our context for everything that we used to do is now different. We may never get back to normal and we certainly can never go back to normal digital operations either.”<br></p>



<h2>Invest in Canada’s Future by Investing in Yourself</h2>



<p>What does all the evolution mean for the digital future of Canadian businesses and talent?</p>



<p>Companies looking for growth opportunities should be looking for talent that are in the pursuit of growth, and creating spaces that motivate them to thrive.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s hard to see where and how some of this disruption is going to take place. But it&#8217;s happening right now,” said Keiser. “It&#8217;s this continual acceleration of disruption and creating new and interesting opportunities and really every space that we&#8217;re where we do business in.”</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re learning about better ways of working and we&#8217;re learning about psychological safety and making sure people have what they need to actually be successful in this environment,” said Megitt.</p>



<p>One big decision individuals should be considering is how they are spending their time, and what can be invested today to earn sought-after rewards tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gibson advised that it is up to the individual to take advantage of the available options. “If you&#8217;re that curious person who prioritizes leaning in and being on a learning journey your entire career, the opportunities are really endless.”</p>



<p>Chan said, “The passion and the energy that you&#8217;re bringing to the table plus your talent is a really powerful combination. If you are leaning into your superpowers, you can help people overlook a lot of your gaps.” She continued, “Everyone here is talking about they&#8217;re looking for talent. [Companies are] looking for good people. They&#8217;re looking for very smart people who want to learn and grow and do better and solve interesting problems.”</p>



<p>Megitt championed the Canadian stereotype of a perceived politesse around the globe as a superpower in itself. “I love that stereotype because I think we are [nice]. We take care of each other and we take care of our own&#8230;Being nice will never mean that we finished last.”</p>

<p><strong>Brick &amp; Mortar to Click &amp; Order: Retail Experience in 2021</strong> – the first instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series –&nbsp; took place on January 21 and featured leaders from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;">

</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">2020 was a year that transformed retail, forcing brands to reconsider and re-invest in the way they market and sell their products among increased online competition.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Many top brands are now offering faster shipping and one-click checkout for seamless UX, as well as AR/VR experiences that allow customers to “touch-and-feel” their preferred products. There has also been an increased focus on omni-channel selling, most notably on social media, with a record of $23.3 billion in social commerce sales expected by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">We spoke with digital marketing and product experts from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong> to share insights on how they’ve adapted their in-person and online shopping experiences for customers, and the trends and channels have been most successful in preparing for the future.<br></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Invest in Ideas Early</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the rapid pace of innovation over the course of the year, some brands had to play catch up to pivot their offerings to fit the digital landscape. Many of the brands that saw success during these uncertain times were ones that were already investing in digital channels and opportunities.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Jonathon Relkin, Director of Off-Premise at Chipotle, credited his team for being an early adopter of emerging tech, from third-party partnerships to Tik Tok. “We were laying the foundation prior to all of this happening,” he said. “We invested in a digital flow from what the customer sees to the back of house operations.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Relkin also saw a swift change in where their revenue was coming from, “20 percent of revenue was coming from digital before. In the height of Corona it went as high as 70 percent. Now we’re averaging at 50 percent and we’re able to lean into it because of the work and investments made to have digital success.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Daniella Bellaire, Head of Global Revenue Enablement and Shopify, noted that whenever changes appear, reducing barriers of adoption across the board is a good place to start.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Retailers are more adaptable than people thought,” she said. Shopify partnered with the Government of Canada to create a Go Digital Canada initiative to help entrepreneurs start up their businesses during this time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Make Data-Driven Decisions&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">For a Consumer Packaging Goods (CPG) company like General Mills, change can be slow as annual cycles have been used for decades. The company, however, has been able to navigate these tricky times by optimizing existing strategies and attempting to automate as many processes as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Our motto for our omnichannel is ‘to show up brilliantly’,” said Jay Picconatto, Director of Commerce at General Mills. “Our retailers wanted quality content across platforms. Most of our energy has been spent to show up brilliantly on all platforms.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The company has also focused on director-to-consumer (D2C) shopping, allowing them to gather and analyze relevant data on their customers, brand, and operational partners. With this information, they&#8217;ve been able to review the effectiveness of their digital strategy and optimize approaches, processes, and campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“E-commerce a year ago was less than five percent of our business. Now, it&#8217;s more than double that. We&#8217;ve had to really have a heavy lift on some of those process tools and capabilities, even just ways of working to make sure that we show up brilliantly on our retailers platforms.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Focus on Your Brand Story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Both Relkin and Bellaire agree that having consistent brand storytelling across your channels is important to a consumer to buy-into the ethos of your brand, to then buy your products. This means investing in your digital infrastructure and leveraging the resources available to you.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“We fundamentally believe we can change the world one burrito at a time,” said Relkin. “We look at our digital ecosystem and the channels that we show up on and really think about who&#8217;s there, why are they there, what are they interested in, and how do we engage in that conversation as a brand.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The reality is digital affords us an ability to do storytelling and probably a better way than than a traditional grocery store does,” said Picconatto. “It allows us to provide solutions in a way that we never could figure out in store. For example, we can even bundle things in different parts of the store online.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Picconatto points to an example how his digital team jumped on a Barbie cake trend that allowed them to sell dolls alongside their Betty Crocker cake mixes. “We could never pull that off in-store,” he said.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Integrate Digital and Analog Experiences</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the adoption of digital platforms and e-commerce, delivering a great user experience is now practically mandatory for success in today’s market. While retailers are looking to create and innovate their digital experiences, our panelists also remind brands to invest in their physical spaces as well, and to rethink how they could be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“User experience is really at the forefront of the digital experience and the online shopping experience. Making sure it’s easy to put things into a cart, and that it’s easy to check out,” said Bellaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Most of the growth online is still being fulfilled in store,” said Picconatto. “When you think about click and collect models for grocery performance, for example.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Stores are working with band-aids right now with having fulfillment warehouses bolted onto the buildings or just sitting in the front of the store. You need to think through the total product offering needed to make [the pick up experience] easier.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Convenience will prevail,” said Bellaire. “But if there’s a unique experience involved, I will show up and I will buy in-person because I want to support my community.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Ultimately, humans love tangible experiences and value convenience. With the retail changes that will continue to unfold, the potential for a new symbiotic relationship between in-store activities and digital conveniences to augment each other to a holistic consumer experience leaves lots of room for entrepreneurs and businesses to find their unique place in this evolving landscape.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job automation is massively transforming our labor force and, for better or worse, will continue to influence what the future of work looks like. From Accountants to Cashiers; Plumbers to Retailers, this </span><a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/07/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by Ilia Blinderman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the likelihood of different roles becoming automated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new wave of work has been dubbed the fourth industrial revolution, one in which our connection to the internet-of-things trumps hardware and, in many cases, human service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_10728" style="width: 961px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10728" class="wp-image-10728 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM.png" alt="snapshot of chart showing the range in which different jobs are likely to be automated from 0% to 100%" width="951" height="737" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM.png 951w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM-300x232.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM-768x595.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10728" class="wp-caption-text">Original image from https://pudding.cool/2017/07/jobs/ by Ilia Blinderman</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked into some of the roles Blinderman found were more likely to be automated. See how these roles have evolved and how employees can future-proof their careers to match the pace of technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bank Tellers</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10731" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10731" class="wp-image-10731" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400.jpg" alt="illustratino of a usb key being plugged into a piggybank" width="700" height="241" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400.jpg 1160w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400-300x103.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400-768x265.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400-1024x353.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400-960x331.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Monteiro_Brainstation_AI_Finance_PiggyBank-e1583941324977-1160x400-331x115.jpg 331w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10731" class="wp-caption-text">All Illustrations by Zach Monteiro</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking has come a long way from hand-written ledgers. Now we’re much more likely to complete transactions at ATMs or, of course, on our personal devices. It’s not uncommon to find banks without any money on site. For example, Tangerine’s Cafes provide a space for customers to speak with a financial advisor, but are not set up for regular transactions; there’s no need when everything can be done through their app. Banks like EQ don’t have a physical space at all and have really risen in the digital financial space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks are leaping into the digital space and employees will need to step up their digital know-how to stay ahead. Here’s how:</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding AI to Leverage Robo-Advisors&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve probably heard the term robo-advisors. Investment banks like Betterment are using AI to automate the investment process so that customers can take charge of their own finances, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investments made on data that may be imperceptible to humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these tools work to eliminate the need for Financial Advisors. However, they open up roles in data, development, and <a href="http://bit.ly/3cS7IXN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product management</a> – this tech, which is legitimately shaking up the financial industry, can’t program itself, and those who have the right skills will be well-positioned to advance their careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Technology to Protect Against Fraud&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud departments have also adapted to the digital era, using </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-transforming-banking-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI to analyze behavior </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to determine unusual activity. Remember when your credit card would be blocked every time you booked a flight ticket? Now banks like CIBC are able to track your spending to understand the purchases you make, even if they may not seem unusual to the human eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these tools and techniques continue to take hold, roles in <a href="http://bit.ly/2TYsPyJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> and AI will increase. There remains, after all, many opportunities for improving the banking process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Shaping FinTech with User Research and Design</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking apps have optimized user experience (UX) design to make banking more friendly and accessible. There have also been </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ux-design-is-playing-a-role-in-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented to improve clients’ financial habits. Now, without human help, we’re able to perform day-to-day banking from a user-friendly screen. For example, companies like Digit automate your savings by monitoring transactions to make an educated guess about how much you can afford to save. The Mint app allows you to easily create budgets and Clarity Money helps users keep an eye on easy-to-overlook subscriptions draining money from their accounts each month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, as the banking industry continues its digital transformation, <a href="http://bit.ly/2xsvEAB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Designers</a> will continue to have a wealth of opportunities, helping institutions understand and solve the pain points of their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bookkeepers and Accountants&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Digital_Skills-e1583941610149.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10730" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Digital_Skills-e1583941610149.jpg" alt="illustration of person on computer with charts and rapidly swiping his hand back and forth. making money online" width="700" height="241"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from the University of Oxford showed that Accountants have a 95 percent chance of seeing their jobs automated – and it makes sense. Tedious data-entry no longer requires manpower; AI has the power to create a more efficient and accurate workflow that can cost 40 percent less than current practices. Accountants and accounting firms can minimize risks to their careers and bottom lines by adapting to the new technology, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Automation to Change the Game</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software automation tools and bots are able to handle higher volumes of repeatable tasks faster and more accurately than humans, easing the workload for Accountants and Bookkeepers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple companies like ZOHO offer a free invoice creator, Highradius offers a cash application software, which offers an array of automated services that are sure to save time for Accountants. LucaNet allows you to automate data validation when comparing invoices to stock codes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CPA of Canada </span><a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/other-general-business-topics/information-management-and-technology/publications/ai-impact-on-accounting-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this new wave of tech as Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which they described as a set of automation tools that allow users to create their own bots, allowing them to handle “high-volume, low complexity, and repeatable tasks faster and with more accuracy and lower cost than humans.” RPA software can also save a company anywhere from 20 to 60 percent of full-time costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to automation tools and bots will lead to a complete overhaul of the accounting process, ultimately leaving more time for Accountants to focus on less dreary aspects of their role. This also opens up a whole new range of job opportunities in the accounting field in the areas of machine learning, <a href="http://bit.ly/2xxZMe9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI, and data science</a>, which will only increase as automation becomes more prevalent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Leveraging UX Design to Simplify Bookkeeping</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like banking, accounting accessibility increases with good UX design. With streamlined and simplified platforms, small business owners and entrepreneurs are able to manage their own bookkeeping and invoicing with tools like QuickBooks, which takes care of tracking cash flow, creating invoices, paying employees, and more all from an easy-to-use interface.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Accounting Seed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improves the accounting process by giving you an easy way to get a full view of your business’s cash flow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Mastering Data Analytics</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Accountants have always relied on data and analytics, advancements in machine learning allow professionals to anticipate future outcomes and make data-driven decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPA Canada reports that advanced analytics will enable Accountants to widen and make more decisive KPIs. “The leveraging of Big Data by advanced analytics solutions can help develop deeper understanding of new market trends, identify new KPIs for performance management, and improve accuracy and timeliness of the forecasting process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes on to say that, “There will also be a heavier emphasis on understanding data correlations and trends, which will require a solid understanding of statistical methods such as regression analysis, sample-size determination, and hypothesis testing. [&#8230;] CPAs will also&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to understand how to leverage self-serve data reporting and visualization tools such as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM Cognos BI, SAP BusinessObjects, Microsoft Power BI, and Tableau to create reports and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboards to present new insights to management.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning data analysis and gaining familiarity with tools like Tableau will open up opportunities for Accountants looking to adapt to the future of work. Data analysis courses are a quick way to upskill in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Secretaries and Administrative Assistants</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, devices are able to edit your calendar, research information, make calls, leave reminders, and more – tasks that would have once required an organized secretary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, in fact, proudly shares that Alexa is able to “simplify conference rooms, allowing meeting attendees to start meetings and control the equipment in the room by simply using their voice. Alexa can also do things around the workplace, like providing directions to a conference room, notifying IT about a broken printer, or placing an order for office supplies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Google recently launched a new feature in which a bot is able to make calls and book appointments as if from a human. With outstanding accuracy, the bot is able to call a restaurant or a hair salon to book an appointment, easily working around rescheduling obstacles and language barriers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JvbHu_bVa_g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true that very few companies have gone that route yet, it is common to be greeted by an iPad in an office lobby. Companies like Greetly offer an app that alerts meeting hosts that a guest has arrived, signs the guest in, provides a name badge, an NDA to be signed, all without a human being involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, these tools replace many of the tasks associated with administrative assistants, but they also open up opportunities for office workers to take on different administrative and operations-based responsibilities. Proactive Administrative Assistants, however, will want to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop new skills, including <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q3ghoI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design thinking</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/3cS7IXN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product management</a>, and more, to both future-proof themselves and improve the administrative field as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Customer Service Representatives</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Pay_for_my_Training-e1583941838191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10732 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Pay_for_my_Training-e1583941838191.jpg" alt="illustration of rows of people working on computers in dark blue hues. There is one person highlighted gold amongst the rows." width="700" height="241"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s getting harder and harder to tell if you’re interacting with a human when contacting customer support, and this will likely increase with time. The truth is, the majority of support inquiries are often repeated and easily answered. A chatbot can save lots of time for companies and customers alike who are looking for a quick answer to a team’s FAQ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Twitter, for example, provide minimal human aid, channeling all of their queries through their Twitter Support Account, which guides you through their FAQs and support center. While convenient, this kind of approach can backfire. Airbnb, for example, has a bad reputation for making it difficult to contact customer support. They don’t provide an email or phone number and instead weave customers through a series of support center links before making a human available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb is not alone, though, as many automated customer service systems are imperfect, creating an opportunity for organizations to differentiate themselves through superior customer service. Uber, for example, makes it quick and easy to report a problem and get a refund with just a few taps, even without human intervention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Improving the CSM Process</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, there are tons of opportunities for organizations to incorporate automation in their customer support processes, which, apart from boosting efficiency and speed, would also significantly change the role of customer service representatives. Instead of spending time doing manual research and handling routine support requests, call center employees assisted by AI could focus on more complex issues, with virtual assistants searching internal databases to find the answers they are looking for, reducing the time it would take to search multiple sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect combination will provide the right amount of convenience and personalized support. For example, Zendesk makes it easier for professionals to manage support tickets, chatbots, and more in a way that simplifies attending to customers highlighting the ways automation can be a helpful and welcome disruptor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Automation and AI Will Create Opportunities&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While large-scale changes inevitably cause anxiety, they also bring about untold opportunity for professionals and organizations willing to <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upskill</a> and reskill. Consider this: A report from McKinsey estimated that overall spending on technology will increase by more than 50 percent in the next decade, creating between 20 and 50 million high-paying jobs around the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a lot of variables involved in that forecast, it illustrates the potential for automation –&nbsp;if we can really embrace it, we can create a whole new world of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Deloitte Center for the Edge wrote: “We have the potential to create significant new value for the enterprise. And paradoxically, these gains will likely come less from all the new technology than from the human workforce you already have today.”</span></p>

<p><strong>What are your main tasks as a Product Designer?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Product Design Manager at Shutterstock, I’ve transitioned from an individual contributor-focused role to a primarily managerial role. My main tasks are creating alignment with the teams I work with, defining product design strategy, and supporting my direct reports and the UX team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means there are a lot of meetings on my calendar these days, but I’m also finding ways to carve out time for strategic ideation, and to pore over the latest customer feedback, which fuels the aforementioned ideation.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some big projects you’ve worked on, or are currently working on at Shutterstock?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year I had the opportunity to bring to life one of my favorite projects I’ve ever worked on: a brand new homepage for our returning customers, with a focus on personalization. The project is ambitious in that it is attempting to change customers’ expectations of what a stock content website can offer them. Several rounds of user research led to the final design that we shipped, and I’m proud to say it’s a wholly user-centric experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big project I’m working on currently is consolidating our customer feedback in one single, searchable platform, to empower our teams to make strategic decisions with customer needs top of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the above, I’ve also been facilitating a number of coding workshops for the Shutterstock UX team. The goal is to empower our Designers to build their own experiments, create more complex, real-world prototypes, and to foster more effective communication and collaboration between Designers and Developers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for keeping a product fresh and relevant? How do you decide what features to push forward?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to really listen to your customers. Conduct user research, and do it as often as you can. Eventually, you’ll start to see the patterns and common pain points, and you’ll understand them so deeply that the ideas you push forward are not only addressing those pain points but are also innovative. To truly be fresh and relevant, one piece of advice I always share with new Designers on the team is to spend more time analyzing and understanding the tech industry at large beyond just Shutterstock’s direct competitors.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10641 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-1024x521.png" alt="screenshot of shutterstock personalized home page" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-1024x521.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-300x153.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-768x391.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-960x488.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM.png 1327w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What teams do you collaborate with to take a product from ideation to completion?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a daily basis, I collaborate with several of our product pods (made up of Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers), as well as my UX family within the company. Outside of those teams, I work closely with our Global Customer Care team, who has a direct line to our customers, as well as our data analytics, marketing, and content teams.</span></p>
<p><strong>What role does user research play in product design at Shutterstock?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User research is a huge part of our product design efforts. We support all of our Designers in planning and conducting their own research. We’re constantly optimizing our research process to diversify when and how we talk to customers, and how we capture and share feedback in an impactful way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, we’ve placed emphasis on bringing the customer feedback to project stakeholders in the form of soundbites and video highlight reels, so that it truly resonates and creates empathy. When you’ve got everyone on the same page, it’s much easier to agree on a way forward, and translate that into a user experience that actually gets shipped.</span></p>
<p><strong>Have you had any mentors? If so, in what ways did they help you develop your career?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people that have deeply inspired me have mostly been from outside the design industry. I had an Art History professor in college who I really looked up to, whose passion for life and art was infectious. She was in her sixties at the time, and, as an underwater archaeologist, she spent every summer diving in search of ancient shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. I went out of my way after my first class with her to take her more advanced course on Greek art history and ended up becoming her in-class Greek translator. She taught me how to appreciate art. I think of her often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my first couple of years at Shutterstock, I had a colleague that I worked with closely who mentored me on how to give thoughtful feedback. I learned a lot from him and I believe I’m a more effective manager because of having worked with him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10643" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-1024x576.jpg" alt="picutre of noguchi working on art piece" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Who are some creators or industry professionals that you’re inspired by?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m inspired by multidisciplinary Artists and Designers who have found ways to create without compromising on method, medium, and vision; especially those who have blurred the lines between applied and fine arts. I’m a jack-of-all-trades, generalist of sorts who wants to make many things in many forms, and I aspire to someday be able to do that without being limited by my professional circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design legends like Isamu Noguchi as well as Charles and Ray Eames are huge inspirations. Among contemporary Designers, a few that come to mind are Designer/Maker Andrew Neyer, Joseph Guerra and Sina Sohrab of Visibility Studio, and creative partnerships like the New York-based Egg Collective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also a huge admirer of Designer and writer Craig Mod. Craig’s views on technology as a self-described “skeptical technology optimist” align with, while often challenging, my own evolving feelings on technology and how it affects and shapes our lives.</span></p>

<p><strong>How does Shutterstock encourage new ideas and creative thinking in the workplace?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Product and UX teams regularly run design sprints to explore new ideas centered around important initiatives. The format is such that it allows breakthroughs in approach that are a few steps beyond just simple iteration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company, we also have twice-a-year hackathon events where cross-functional teams come together to build new and exciting things. Many of the projects that have come out of our hackathons have gone on to become part of the Shutterstock platform. For example, our “view in room” augmented reality feature for mobile which went into production shortly after being presented as a hackathon project.</span></p>

<p><strong>Are there any unexpected everyday things that have inspired you while designing something new?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my favorite things to do when starting something new is sketching my ideas on paper before doing anything digitally. I find that the format helps me put things down quickly without thinking about any of the details too much. With that kind of ease and speed, an initial idea can turn into several offspring ideas in the span of a few minutes. This method, a kind of brainstorm conversation between myself and the paper, often leads me down unexpected, but always promising, paths.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are your favorite resources to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in product design?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been a subscriber of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidebar.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily newsletter for years. It’s a good combination of industry-specific resources and inspiring miscellaneous content. I also really enjoy the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track Changes podcast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the folks at Postlight; the conversations are candid and insightful, and the guests are top notch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What’s an old design trend you wish would become popular again?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn’t one specific design trend that I wish to see return, but, in general, I’d like to see more diversity in user interface design. I was there when CSS Zen Garden became </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> destination for web design inspiration (how old does that make me?), and I was very inspired by it. By contrast, the web is looking very uniform these days, and even though that has come with benefits for users and product teams alike, it’s also stifling creativity in many ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tooling for building websites has gotten so complicated that we spend too much time figuring out how to improve loading times, and there’s nearly no time left for testing the waters with new and unexpected things. I’m not suggesting we should trade one for the other; I’m saying we need to shift the balance back toward creativity. To clarify even further, that doesn’t mean to cram more stuff, more animations, or more illustrations on a webpage, but rather to boldly consider taking away stuff, however one defines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuff</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their own role. To be creative means to think differently, then apply that thinking in the interfaces we design.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10644 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie.jpg" alt="hans wegner designing chair porotype" width="333" height="229" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie.jpg 333w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite product, service, or experience that gives you design envy?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well designed, timeless furniture will do that for me. Take almost any chair designed by Hans Wegner, for instance. On the digital side of things, I’ve been surprised by how quickly I’ve gotten accustomed to using Apple Pay when I’m out and about. It’s so quick and seamless. It’s amazing because multiple pieces of hardware and software have to learn to speak to each other for this particular interaction to work, and the Designers and Engineers at Apple have pulled it off really well, in my opinion.</span></p>

After </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-we-learned-at-social-media-week-toronto"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we sat with content creation expert and Creative Director, Matt Manuge, to learn more about his guideline to creating compelling campaigns.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0N5A0154.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0N5A0154-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10383" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0N5A0154-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0N5A0154-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0N5A0154-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/0N5A0154-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><b>What&#8217;s a typical day look like for you as a Creative Director?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the answer that everyone will give you, which is, no two days look alike. It’s a bit of a copout response, but it is true in our particular business – Not only do no two days, look alike, no two projects look alike. One day we&#8217;ll be answering an RFP to try to win business. Another day will be on set directing or overseeing a shoot. You know, one week we&#8217;ll be focused on beauty products, next it will be automotive, next it will be food. So, it&#8217;s all over the place, which is fun. I like it; it’s chaotic.</span></p>



<p><b>Do you find you have to be a chameleon in your skills and knowledge? How do you set yourself up to be a beauty expert and an automotive expert?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a certain level of multidisciplinary skill sets that you have to have, but more on the actual execution. So, being able to write, edit, understand graphics and art direction, talk to talent and clients, etc. Knowing genres is either just having the wherewithal to do the research into that, or the confidence to know that you&#8217;re not smart enough for that genre and to talk to subject matter experts who know it way better than you and really lean on them.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly somebody like me should not be talking about hair care. Even though I&#8217;ve done a lot of hair care stuff, I’m bald and I think I might use a bar of Dove soap and that&#8217;s it. So, I had to learn about curly hair problems.</span></p>



<p><b>In your 30 under 30 interview, you said we have to basically step back and see what people really want to watch when creating content. So, how do you determine what someone really is looking to watch?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to work in film and TV for quite a few years, and you always create content because you want to tell a story; you want people to watch that story. The thing with branded content and advertising is, you might have these great grandiose ideas, but at the end of the day, do people really care? If it wasn&#8217;t being served to them as an ad, would people legitimately want to watch it? So, there&#8217;s a lot of things we do to understand “Does it have LEGS” as we say. Or, if it doesn&#8217;t have those things (those are meant for entertainment purposes), does the content offer something of value?</span></p>



<h2><figure><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog.png"><img class="wp-image-10410 size-medium alignright" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog-300x300.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog-150x150.png 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog-768x768.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog-109x109.png 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Legs-for-Blog-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/three-companies-leading-the-way-with-content"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has to offer something of value to a person to give them their time, because time is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> valuable nowadays.</span></p>



<p><b>What’s the story that almost anybody really wants to watch? What&#8217;s a good story that people are looking for?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well creative is subjective, so it&#8217;s important that you really understand what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with your content and who your audience is. Once you understand your audience, that&#8217;s when you can appeal to them through your content. I find one of the challenges that a lot of brands make is they don&#8217;t simplify their objectives. Sometimes marketers or companies are stuck thinking branded content is the same as their TV commercial, and that&#8217;s not the case at all. I can&#8217;t tell you the amount of times I&#8217;ve gone into a piece of content, with the best intentions and it gets watered down because of all the messages included in it. You want to tell [your audience] that you’re new, but you also want to tell them that you’re fresh, and you want to tell them this and that. By that point, you&#8217;ve completely watered down your story away from what made it unique in the first place.</span></p>



<p><b>Is there any campaign in particular that you like?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One that I talked about in Social Media Week, was a campaign we did for AXE. One of the great things about it was that AXE as a brand knew that they needed to change their perception, and they were willing to take a risk by making a piece of content that never showed the product whatsoever and really just focused on the people and their stories. And, so that was really cool and smart risk by AXE.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editor&#8217;s Note: Matt’s team also recently released a Lysol campaign to increase usage of their products. People already know to clean their toilets and floors, but never think about cleaning their lightswitches or door knobs. So, they created a series called Germ Busters where families use a real-life germ detecting device to expose bacteria levels on every-day items. It&#8217;s both disgusting and fun. You can watch the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/OLg00DlDHcc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first episode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on YouTube.</span></p>

<p><b>A lot of successful companies are value based. At SMW, you had mentioned Patagonia, many of their ads are about saving the forest, </b><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-knix-is-defining-the-future-of-retail-online-and-offline"><b>Knix</b></a><b> is about body positivity, but then there are brands that don&#8217;t try to be the “good guy.” Uber and Amazon aren’t trying to be philanthropic, but are still super successful. Do you think these companies would do better if they had more ethics embodied in their branding?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not necessarily. Patagonia can do it extremely well – they&#8217;re able to take risks through their content because they have such a strong idea of their identity. Some brands still have a strong idea of who they are, but who they are isn&#8217;t to make these big, grandiose, philanthropic, save-the-rainforest, messages. If you&#8217;re a broom company, you can be a kick-ass broom company without giving back to charity. There are tons of companies out there that aren&#8217;t “sexy” and don&#8217;t need to do those things, but can still make great content and great products and serve a need.</span></p>



<p><b>When you are acquiring a new client, what are some of the first steps you take?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask a lot of questions. The majority of clients that we work with are one-off projects, so it&#8217;s impossible for us to live and breathe the brand as well as the brands do. So, early on in the relationship, we work hard at taking as much knowledge out of their brains as possible. The big question I like to ask is “what is storytelling success to you?” If a viewer saw this piece of content, and could only come away with one thing. What is that one thing? Is it that it smells good or there’s a sale? I do my best to try to understand all of those things before we even start brainstorming.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/axe_bap.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/axe_bap-1024x683.jpg" alt="An AXE campaign shot by Blue Ant Plus.

<p><b>A lot of your content generally are these beautiful long-form pieces. How do you balance that with the low attention span of a scroller?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I personally believe that however long it takes to tell the story is the length the content should be. But, it&#8217;s also important to understand where the content is living and what the objective is. Our portfolio is filled with some long-form pieces, but it&#8217;s equally as filled with six- and 15-second videos, we just tell those stories a little bit differently. Often when we approach a shoot, we&#8217;ll think of what the overarching story is – what needs to be communicated. And then we think about where it&#8217;s going to be living. From there, we adapt our story specifically to those formats, because we also know that a TV commercial doesn&#8217;t have the same impact as it would on YouTube, and a YouTube video won&#8217;t have the same impact as it will on Facebook, Instagram, Tik-Tok, or Snapchat.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-09-at-3.08.51-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-09-at-3.08.51-PM.png" alt="Biore campaign by Blue Ant Plus.

Take a 10-mni break&quot;" class="wp-image-10386" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-09-at-3.08.51-PM.png 404w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-09-at-3.08.51-PM-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></a><figcaption>Biore campaign by Blue Ant Plus</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><b>Do you take one piece of content and repurpose it for each channel? Or do you produce fresh content for each?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There used to be a time where we used the phrase “cut down” a lot. You’d start with the hero video and then you would cut it down to a fifteen and six second length. One of the things that we&#8217;ve stolen from Facebook was the word Remix, because cutdown is such a negative thing. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re getting the “lesser-than” piece of content. Oftentimes it&#8217;s that fifteen or six second format that more people will see than the actual long form video, so we always try to think ahead to create content that&#8217;s specific for that six-second form. Recently, we did a really fun series for Lysol and the actual long-form video is four minutes long, but then we made specific videos for fifteen and six seconds. We wrote scripts for those videos in advance and recorded them separately.</span></p>



<p><b>Are you finding more requests for Snapchat or Tick-Tock formatted videos?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so much. Although, Tik-Tok is a platform that I personally love. Tik-Tok is probably the most creative platform I&#8217;ve seen. The stuff that people are making on it is wild. It makes me think that there&#8217;s going to be a generation of filmmakers who are gonna completely blow me out of the water in 5 years.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What would you say is a common trait amongst creative directors? And do you have that trait?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized very early on when I took on this role that the thing I enjoy most about being a creative is when I make a decision, whether it’s choosing a color or writing a piece of dialogue, I get the most enjoyment when that component goes live in the market. So, as a Creative Director, I ensure that my team makes those decisions for themselves. So, I guess the one thing that I hope other creative directors do is really empower and trust the people underneath them to do their best creative work.</span></p>



<p><b>Do you still get to do any filming for fun or have any personal creative filming outlets?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not as much as I would hope. I used to have a lot of side-hustles and projects. Sometimes the reality of work is you get bogged down and I don’t always have the time of day. I try to do little things like doodling or taking a goofy picture of my dog or a tik-tok video, little things like that to exercise my creative muscles.</span></p>



<p><b>What skills are important in the workforce today in Marketing and beyond?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, especially in what I do, people have to learn to be </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-marketers-need-to-focus-on-digital-skills-training"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multidisciplinary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When I started my career in film and TV, I came from a world where everyone had one job and that’s what you did. If you were an editor you were an editor, if you were in graphics, you did graphics, but eventually people started embracing this idea that the cameraman can also be the director. We ask a lot from our team to be able to do multiple things. Our graphic designer is also a photographer, our writer is our copyeditor and will partake in brainstorms, so I would say in general, people need to be open to learning new skill sets completely, be open to trying to learn as much as you possibly can.</span></p>



<p><b>What’s next for Blue Ant Plus</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><a href="https://blueantplus.com/portfolio-type/portfolio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what’s next for us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is evolving our identity and figuring out what we’re awesome at and the best way that we can help brands and clients create content that will truly connect with people.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the start of her career, Carrie Oehm has lived and breathed sports and entertainment news. Having worked for Rogers TV, TSN, SportsNet, and BlogTO, it was only natural that she join The GIST as their Social Media Manager to master sports content that appealed to any gender.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After her panel at&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-we-learned-at-social-media-week-toronto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Media Week</a>, we spoke with Oehm on how she creates attention-grabbing content, the <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/diversity-in-leadership-building-a-culture-for-women-to-succeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future of work for women</a>, and what it’s like to be a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/social-media-marketing?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog_carrieTheGist&amp;utm_campaign=course_digitalMarketingDiploma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Media</a> Manager at The GIST.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6367.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6367-1024x683.jpg" alt="Carrie Oehm at the GIST" class="wp-image-10360" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6367-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6367-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6367-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_6367-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><b>What does your role entail as a Social Media Manager at The GIST?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I run The GIST’s social media accounts! Other than our Twitter page (shout-out to our AMAZING social content contributor, Alexis), I am in charge of producing, editing, hosting, interviewing, and posting the content that you see on our channels.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With The GIST being a startup, it is important that I wear multiple hats in my role as well. Thankfully, I’ve always been into fashion and hats have always been crucial to my wardrobe, haha! All jokes aside, Ellen (one of our three co-founders &amp; Head of Content) and I work very closely on <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-plan-a-social-media-marketing-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media planning</a>, strategy, content distribution, paid acquisition, presentation decks, and brand identification. I’ve also been able to dabble in helping with website design and analytics.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>How do you create content that grabs attention?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lot of trial and error, constantly asking the audience what they want to see, and ultimately making content that people care about and that provokes emotion. At the end of the day, we interact with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so much</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> content, and the content that makes us feel some sort of way, whether that be a joy, sadness, or anger, is the content that we share and interact with. So, when I’m posting content I ask myself how that piece is going to make our audience feel, if it’s on-brand, and what our audience can take away from what I’m posting.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m very fortunate to have the experience I do from working at television networks. For close to five years, I was in charge of packaging game highlights, news stories, and breaking news from the world of sports. Most nights I was watching an entire game and had to package a 30-45 second highlight pack of the game’s most epic points while still telling the story. I’ve now taken that ability and use it for social content. When I’m watching a game, I can watch a play happen and instantly know that it’s going to go viral, I can pick out which shot angle will be replayed the most, and I can tell what player reaction or fan reaction will be on SportsCentre tomorrow morning. I’m very grateful for the experience I gained from working with the best sports television producers in the country, it taught me a lot.</span></p>



<p><b>Why do you think The GIST has caught on so quickly?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was, and is, a gap in the sports media market. The female audience and the casual sports fan are underserved in the sports media landscape. I truly believe that our three co-founders, Ellen, Jacie, &amp; Roslyn, have been trailblazers in trying to find a solution to connect and empower women through sport.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, sports are a social currency. It’s something that connects people at work, school, at dinner, etc., and we want everyone to be able to connect through sport, not just the hardcore sports fan.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think that women are underrepresented in sports and sports media. For instance, when I left one of my past sports network jobs, out of 83 people in division (excluding hosts and reporters), there were three women. At the end of the day, it’s difficult for 80 men who are hardcore sports fans to create content for a female audience. We also cover women’s sports &#8212; a lot of other outlets don’t. For example, when the WNBA finals were being played on ESPN2, NBA preseason was being played on the main channel. Also, Canada’s leading sports network aired the top 100 plays from 2019, and there was ONE play from women’s sports. They’re being underrepresented, period.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are trying to change that by giving them the coverage they deserve, we are trying to level the playing field, and I hope that it rubs off on others. Our success clearly shows there’s a market for it.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>How do you see women-centric companies (The Wing, The GIST, etc.) shaping the business/tech world?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that companies that are women-empowering are helping shape culture in general. I worked with Bumble briefly before joining <a href="https://www.thegistnews.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GIST</a>, and it’s honestly super refreshing to have now worked with two groups that are so strong, independent, smart, driven, and focused on empowering women. It’s a game-changer.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve found that other companies have reached out to us because they don’t exactly know how to reach female audiences – that is HUGE. For companies to realize they are underserving an audience and they want to fix it? It’s 2020 and that should have been in the playbook long before now, but the fact that change is happening is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big. The fact that female athletes are advocating for equal pay on world stages (hats off to Megan Rapinoe) is huge. Yes, we still have an enormous amount to grow, but I’m seeing a shift in companies wanting to change, but most importantly realizing that they need to change.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-06-at-2.15.03-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-06-at-2.15.03-PM.png" alt="The Gist News" class="wp-image-10334" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-06-at-2.15.03-PM.png 845w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-06-at-2.15.03-PM-300x290.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-06-at-2.15.03-PM-768x742.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><b>How much do you take social media algorithms into account when posting content?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I definitely take algorithms into account while posting content. From the way I construct my captions to the way I produce my videos, I play by the algorithm’s rules. The algorithm is also always changing, so I constantly keep up-to-date with the latest changes by watching YouTube videos, asking fellow creators, and listening to podcasts. I want to know what the best creators are doing to work with the algorithms so I can learn from their tips, tricks, and failures.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>How has your role at BlogTO contributed or prepared you for the kinds of content you select for your audience at The GIST?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlogTO opened my eyes to digital content. Before, I only made broadcast journalism content, which is entirely different. I was making five-minute-long features with sit-down interviews and news pieces that were voiced over by anchors. The content that BlogTO produces is fast-paced, engaging, and it gives you “the gist” of a new restaurant or event in a one-to-two minute video. BlogTO has really helped me learn how to create content that caters to the Gen Z and Millennial audience and gave me a foundation for how to create content for our audience at The GIST.</span></p>



<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFNwNV0P-_Y" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>



<p><b>How do you manage your screen time? Have you had to make adjustments to ensure you’re not on social media too often?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be honest, it’s very hard at times! My screen time is crazy-high, so I’ve been picking up hobbies that don’t involve screens. In the morning when I wake up, I don’t look at my phone until I’ve taken a few minutes to write in my journal, meditate (I used the Calm app), and have my coffee. I also try and workout for at least an hour a day, LOVE cooking, and I recently picked up painting! Like I mentioned before, I am into fashion, so I’ve been painting sneakers! I absolutely do not know what I’m doing, but it’s very therapeutic for me to put my phone away and pick up a paintbrush!&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What skills do you think are most important for today and tomorrow&#8217;s workforce in marketing and beyond.</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to be adaptable, persistent, patient, passionate, and you have to work your ass off. It is so damn competitive today. We have more educated and skilled professionals than ever, so you have to find a way to stand out and you have to put the work in.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t have a Saturday off for two years when I first started in broadcasting, I had four internships in school while also working on weekends. I’ve worked jobs that I’ve absolutely hated with bosses that treated me horribly just so I could get the experience I needed.</span></p>



<p><b>What’s next for The GIST?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 is going to be a big year for us! We are kicking off the year by expanding to Boston (our second American city) and are launching a new podcast at the end of January. That’s all I can say right now, but it’s going to be a very exciting year for our team. I’m very grateful to be part of such a badass team and can’t wait to see where we can grow the company!</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve talked about how New York may be </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-new-york-is-poised-to-surpass-silicon-valley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poised to surpass Silicon Valley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how Boston is experiencing a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-bostons-bioboom-means-for-the-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boom in the biotech industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we wanted to take a closer look at the growth of job markets on a state level. Are there larger regional trends that can help us pinpoint where the greatest career opportunities may exist?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out, we looked at </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmstate.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and tracked the net amount of new businesses opened in every state over the last ten years. What we found was both expected and surprising in equal measures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the states that saw the largest net amount of new businesses in the last ten years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how the overall map looked:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9860 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901.png" alt="map of USA showing net amount of businesses opened" width="1000" height="932" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901.png 1000w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901-300x280.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901-768x716.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901-960x895.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the more surprising states to make the list, starting with:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>The Growth of the Utah Job Sector</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most surprising about our findings were Utah and North Dakota ending up on the top five list. We’ll get to North Dakota later, but first, let’s take a look at what could be leading to Utah’s sudden entrepreneurial boom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Utah is on fire, relatively speaking. According to a report from Wells Fargo, the state’s economy is among the fastest-growing in the nation, which may be encouraging would-be entrepreneurs and investors alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s doing well for all the reasons you&#8217;d want to see an economy do well — mainly a fast-growing labor force [that] is very well-educated and young,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.deseret.com/2019/3/28/20669517/utah-economy-among-the-fastest-growing-in-u-s-here-s-why"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wells Fargo Economist Charlie Dougherty, adding that the economy is also among the most diverse in the nation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo’s report points to the development of new sectors like cloud computing, big data, and software development, as well as the growth of aerospace and life sciences as reasons for the state’s positive economic outlook. The numbers back this up. The growth in the number of tech jobs in the state has grown 4.9 percent over the last 10 years, which is more than triple the tech job growth rate of the United States as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Utah enjoyed the nation’s fastest job growth over the past 12 months, but according to federal data, it was actually the construction industry that led the way, expanding by 6.2 percent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that while Utah led the country in job growth by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">percentage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the states with the biggest increase in the number of new jobs were actually Texas (350,000), California (269,100), and Florida (170,500).&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Boston’s BioBoom Fuels Job Growth&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts&#8217; appearance on the top five list makes sense given the growth of the region’s biotech sector. The Boston area alone has </span><a href="https://www.massbio.org/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 1,100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> biotech and biopharma companies, academic centers, and life-science organizations, making it a world leader in this area. In fact, on FierceBiotech’s Fierce 15 list of the world’s most promising biotech companies, six of the 15 companies highlighted were based in the Boston area:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrakis Therapeutics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beam Therapeutics&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jnana Therapeutics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kronos Bio</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandion Therapeutics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass Therapeutics</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs in the biotech industry grew by 28 percent from 2008 to 2017, and by 4.3 percent in that final year alone. There are now more than 70,000 people employed in the industry in the state, averaging an annual wage of $149,731. If you’re doing the math, that means the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-bostons-bioboom-means-for-the-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts biotech workforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is bringing home just over $10.4 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, venture investment in the state’s biopharma companies was $3.1 billion in 2017. This is a staggering number when you consider that these Massachusets companies received 37 percent of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">biopharma VC dollars invested in the US that year. And while significant investment in the field comes from outside the state, there are well-established, local venture capital firms that specialize in the sector. F-Prime Capital, for example, was among the first VC companies to focus on biopharmaceuticals, medtech, and healthcare IT services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston’s, and Massachusetts’, growth as a worldwide biotech hub has actually created a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/demand-for-talent-rising-amid-bostons-tech-industry-growth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talent shortage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially when it comes to tech-related jobs. The State of the Tech Economy report found that nearly 10,000 new tech jobs were added in Massachusetts in the previous year. A follow-up report, the Massachusetts Tech Pulse Index, meanwhile, found that 70 percent of tech employers expected to increase employment over the following six month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve had a long career in human resources and watched a lot of (hiring) cycles,” Russ Campanello, Executive Vice President of Human Resources at iRobot, </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/02/19/the-war-for-tech-talent-escalates/ejUSbuPCjPLCMRYlRZIKoJ/story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Boston Globe, “and this is as intense as any of them.”</span></p>
<h2><b>North Dakota Rides the Crude Oil Boom</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota may be another unexpected name on the top five list, but it’s not that surprising when you take a closer look. For one thing, North Dakota is riding an unprecedented oil boom. In fact, the U.S. is now producing more crude oil than any other country, and the state is playing a large role in that. Overall, North Dakota is the number two oil state in the US (behind Texas) and is now setting </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?f=M&amp;n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPND1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">production records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in oil production has had a clear impact on communities (and business creation) across the state. NPR recently focused on Watford City, which has seen its population more than tripled in the past decade, from 1,790 to 6,523.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our town is booming, our main street is full. You don&#8217;t go through little towns and see every storefront have a business in it. We do,&#8221; one resident </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/23/669198912/after-struggles-north-dakota-grows-into-its-ongoing-oil-boom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in North Dakota is now at 2.6 percent, which is lower than the national average. The state’s population is also rising. In fact, of the 3,142 counties in America, there is only one that has grown by over 50 percent in the last eight years, and that county is Williams County, North Dakota, which grew 57.8 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That isn’t to say that North Dakota’s growing job market and population are exclusively related to oil. Inc. magazine recently included </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine North Dakota companies on its Inc. 5000 list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which highlights the nation&#8217;s fastest-growing companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the ND companies that made the list, along with their industry and growth rates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoSchedule, Bismarck, software,&nbsp; 2,771 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haga Kommer, Fargo, financial services, 1,482 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PRx Performance, Fargo, retail, 742 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNG Team, West Fargo, business products and services, 148 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovery Benefits, Fargo, health, 119 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hatch Realty, Fargo, real estate, 119 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myriad Mobile, Fargo, software, 80 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomsen Homes, Fargo, construction, 74 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedigree Technologies, Fargo, software, 57 percent</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s anything this list makes clear, it’s that the state’s economy is diversifying, with software and tech playing a much more prominent role, all of which bodes well for the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned over the next few weeks as we take a closer look at each of the states listed here, particularly with regard to the growth of tech jobs.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently explored the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/six-industry-leaders-on-the-future-of-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">future of digital marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the innovations and opportunities on the horizon, but there’s still one marketing necessity that has been a constant for more than a century: a memorable and distinct logo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that nearly 70 percent of digital marketers list brand awareness as their top goal, and a logo plays a crucial role in forging connections with customers. Indeed, have a look at Interbrand’s rankings of the best global brands, and we’re certain that you could picture the logo of any of the top-ranked companies – Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Coca-Cola – with your eyes closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So clearly, companies take a big risk when they change their logos, whether it’s a tweak or a major overhaul. Here are six recent examples of major companies successfully rebranding their signature logos.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s strength in simplicity, and that was a guiding principle when Uber decided in 2018 to ditch the logo it had unveiled only two years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thousands of hours polling users around the world, the ride-sharing company came to a few major </span><a href="https://www.uber.design/case-studies/rebrand-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conclusions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: black scored 88 percent favorability, Uber was a household name, and mobile users were wondering where the U went.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing we heard was, a lot of drivers and riders didn’t understand what the symbol was,” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90235065/uber-has-a-new-brand-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Forrest Young, creative director at brand consultancy Wolff Olins, which worked with Uber on the project. “You’d get picked up by the car and it would say Uber, but it wouldn’t marry with the app.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From those observations, the company’s new logo – simply its name– was born.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Uber_logo_2018.svg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9544" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Uber_logo_2018.svg" alt="uber logo" width="463" height="161" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The custom typography created for the logo was inspired by the world’s best transportation-related signage, like the American Highway Gothic and the German traffic typeface DIN. The company also swapped its all-caps name for title case, which seems more approachable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the new logo is intended to imply movement – but most crucially, it’s simple and recognizable enough that there’s a practical benefit: eliminating confusion among users trying to spot their ride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we expand our reach into our other markets and modalities, it’s super important that it’s very clear when you’re getting into an Uber car or on an Uber scooter, you know that is an Uber product,” </span><a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/get-an-exclusive-look-at-ubers-new-brand-revamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uber executive brand director Peter Markatos. “We weren’t achieving that with our current system.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Airbnb</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2013, Airbnb set out to re-imagine their logo. The company hired DesignStudio to embark on what became a year-long project, involving visiting 13 cities across four continents, staying with 18 hosts, and recording every detail of their trips. More than 120 employees at Airbnb’s Bay Area headquarters were also interviewed over three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our creative strategy was informed by the insights we uncovered in the immersion,” read a DesignStudio report on their strategy. “In particular, we found that when people came into contact with Airbnb they typically have a strong, emotional sense of purpose and affection for the community they’re a part of, yet this spirit wasn’t communicated through the brand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was a combination of four simple symbols: a head to represent people, a location icon for places, a heart to signify love, and an “A” for Airbnb. Named The Bélo, the new logo was intended to be a symbol of “belonging,” according to Co-Founder </span><a href="http://blog.airbnb.com/author/brianchesky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Chesky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMITXMrrVQU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You see, a house is just a space, but a home is where you belong. And what makes this global community so special is that for the very first time, you can belong anywhere,” said Chesky. “The rewards you get from Airbnb aren’t just financial &#8212; they’re personal &#8211;for hosts and guests alike.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the new logo was unveiled on July 16, 2014, Airbnb trended on Twitter for eight hours. The campaign won a slew of awards, including gold and silver from the Cannes Lions, a Clio, gold, and silver from Transform Europe and the 2015 Brand Impact award.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel our brand of yesteryear was starting to hold back our ability to go mainstream, and limiting people’s idea of what it could become,” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3033130/airbnb-unveils-a-major-rebranding-effort-that-paves-the-way-for-sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky. “This new branding changes the whole identity and expression of the company.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Instagram</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, the public is so loyal to logos that any change can inspire an outcry. Instagram’s story shows that there’s value in taking the long view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the social-media giant announced it would update its logo from one inspired by vintage Polaroid and Bell &amp; Howell cameras to a more modern and colorful mark. The company asked its own employees to draw the Instagram icon from memory, and almost all drew the rainbow, lens, and viewfinder, so those were then viewed as key elements. The new logo was fresh, flat, and gradient-oriented.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-9541 alignleft" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/480px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg.png" alt="instagram logo" width="285" height="285" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/480px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg.png 480w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/480px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg-150x150.png 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/480px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg-300x300.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/480px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg-109x109.png 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/480px-Instagram_logo_2016.svg-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the rebrand, the company also gave its related apps – Layout, Boomerang, and Hyperlapse – new icons that harmonized better with the main new logo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The evolution of the community has been inspiring, and we hope that we’ve captured some of the life, creativity and optimism people bring to Instagram every day,” </span><a href="https://medium.com/@ianspalter/designing-a-new-look-for-instagram-inspired-by-the-community-84530eb355e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ian Spalter, Head of Design at Instagram. “Our hope is that people will see this app icon as a new creative spark – something to have fun with and make their own. We’re excited for where this will take us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the public’s response was angry, one-sided and, well, unfiltered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdWeek deemed the new logo a “</span><a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/instagrams-new-logo-travesty-can-we-change-it-back-please-171398/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travesty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a writer at the Guardian </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/instagram-new-logo-photo-sharing-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it looked like the old camera in the image was murdered at sundown, and GQ </span><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/instagram-logo-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Instagram was flushing its brand equity “down the toilet for the home screen equivalent of a Starburst.” The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/technology/the-great-instagram-logo-freakout-of-2016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it the “Great Instagram Logo Freakout of 2016.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But others saw the change as necessary, given that Instagram had evolved from an app that was largely used to give photos a retro, 1970s feel with various filters to simply one of the most-used social media platforms around. The old logo also didn’t reflect new features that had rolled out, like video and Instagram stories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Instagram logo was distinct, but old,” </span><a href="https://www.marketing-interactive.com/instagram-logo-change-users-overreacting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jonathan Bonsey, principal creative and executive officer of the Bonsey Design Partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, by 2018 AdWeek had changed its tune and ran a new </span><a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/after-2-years-has-everyone-finally-chilled-out-about-the-instagram-logo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concluding that everyone had likely finally “chilled out” about the logo. Even amid the peak of the frenzy, not everyone lost perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Give it a couple of weeks, and if recent history has proved anything, Instagram’s widely mourned little hipster camera will be a distant memory,” </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/health/instagram-new-logo-change/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CNN’s A.J. Willingham.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/"><b>American Express</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some logo redesigns go big, bold, and drastic – and then there’s AmEx, whose 2018 refresh was so subtle you’d be forgiven if you didn’t notice the change at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But plenty of thought went into the credit-card company’s first logo redesign in more than 40 years. Design consultancy </span><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pentagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was tasked with reworking the brand’s iconic Blue Box logo – introduced in 1975 –  with one of the goals being to create a typographic language that could live outside of the box, as well as work better across various platforms and channels, given that detailed marks don’t always present clearly on mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t want people to say, Oh, did you see that new logo [ugh],” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90167571/american-express-gets-its-first-new-logo-in-over-40-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pentagram partner Abbott Miller. “It was more if you cleaned the smudges off your lenses. It’s cleaner. Clearer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, the difference is far from drastic, but the designers redrew the letterforms and rendered the logo in an overall bolder way that would register better on small screens.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-9546 alignleft" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo.png" alt="american express logo" width="291" height="291" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo.png 1600w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo-150x150.png 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo-300x300.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo-768x768.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo-109x109.png 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/American_express_new_logo-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team also worked with a type designer to develop lettering that was faithful to the original logo. In the original design, the letters were outlined with no negative space of their own, so they couldn’t be pulled out of the box or away from the outline. The new version can work on its own – for instance, as a letterhead or on a billboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team also came up with a new secondary cropped logo, with an off-center “Amex,” for mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the small but purposeful changes are what the design team felt suited a company with a 169-year history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“American Express should never walk away from this incredible heritage,” Miller </span><a href="https://qz.com/1248777/american-express-is-the-newest-member-of-the-minimalist-logo-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The research shows that there is incredible respect for the brand, and affection for its imagery.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Mailchimp</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mailchimp was founded back in 2001, it began as a side project for Co-Founders Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius to help clients with their email marketing. Since, the company has grown immensely into a leading small-business marketing platform with millions of customers around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when the company decided to change its logo in 2018, it was less about esthetics and more about reflecting that evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of branding agency </span><a href="https://www.wearecollins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mailchimp introduced a playful new design that finally united “Freddie” – their winking monkey mascot – with the logo script that had previously never appeared before in the same logo. The company also changed the “c” in Mailchimp to lower-case, again reflecting that the company had grown beyond email to provide services including automations, ads, landing pages and postcards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooper Light is the company’s typeface – an update on the 1920s, pre-digital typeface Cooper Black, which, </span><a href="https://mailchimp.com/design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might recognize from “dusty old funk records” – and Cavendish Yellow is Mailchimp’s bold new brand color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new branding was unveiled alongside a series of child-like illustrations on Mailchimp’s website, which – along with the logo itself – convey a playful, approachable feeling.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9548" style="width: 519px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9548" class=" wp-image-9548" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mailchimp-product-image.png" alt="mailchimp logo" width="509" height="255" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mailchimp-product-image.png 1200w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mailchimp-product-image-300x150.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mailchimp-product-image-768x384.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mailchimp-product-image-1024x512.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mailchimp-product-image-960x480.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9548" class="wp-caption-text">source: digital downloads</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That wry sense of humor is an authentic part of their brand,” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241616/see-mailchimps-weird-new-branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ben Crick, a Creative Director at Collins. “They have more of a right to it than most of the tech companies that rely on humor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s another side to that. Just as Mailchimp wanted a new logo that reflected their tremendous growth as an organization – and they now send roughly 1 billion emails per day – they also wanted something quirky and light-hearted enough to send the message that they hadn’t lost the light-hearted spirit that had been part of their culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the de facto way to look if you’re a tech company,” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241616/see-mailchimps-weird-new-branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Angie Shih, a Collins Strategist. “The trajectory of every company is that you’re quirky, friendly, approachable, and when you become a massive company with a lot of employees, you become austere, sterile.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.dunkindonuts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Dunkin’</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where reimagining an aging logo is enough for some companies, Dunkin’ took it a step further and did something drastic: they dropped the “Donuts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nearly 70-year-old coffee institution rolled out a fresh new logo last year along with the news that – while donuts wouldn’t be disappearing from its menu – the company was now going to be on a “first-name basis” with America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative agency Jones Knowles Ritchie didn’t want to radically alter the company’s esthetic – especially not the unapologetically eye-catching pink and orange colours originally introduced in 1973, or the brand’s iconic Frankfurter font (the agency </span><a href="https://www.jkrglobal.com/case-studies/dunkin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> update it into a new font called “Dunkin Sans” and introduced “Dunkin Serif,” inspired by the brand’s use of Souvenir in the 1970s).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new logo instead sheds both the word “Donuts” and the image of a cup of coffee, instead opting simply for “Dunkin” in orange font with a pink apostrophe. The company </span><a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/releases-20180925" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the logo extensively on exterior signage.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9550" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1280px-Dunkin_logo.svg.png" alt="dunkin donuts logo" width="678" height="123" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1280px-Dunkin_logo.svg.png 1280w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1280px-Dunkin_logo.svg-300x54.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1280px-Dunkin_logo.svg-768x139.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1280px-Dunkin_logo.svg-1024x186.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1280px-Dunkin_logo.svg-960x174.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes were motivated by wanting to shift focus to Dunkin’s status as a beverage-led company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are bringing the iconic name Dunkin’ to the forefront in a bold way that brings to life how we refill optimism with each cup and bring fun, joy and delight to our customers each and every day,” said Chief Marketing Officer Tony Weisman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign won a Cannes Bronze Lion as well as two D&amp;AD Pencils. It also created one billion impressions in the first 24 hours and three billion impressions over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even better news for the venerable chain? After making the switch in January 2019, the company reported 5.5 percent systemwide sales growth in the first quarter and 3.8 percent systemwide sales growth in the second quarter.</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The food and restaurant industry has found a new key ingredient that is having a transformative effect on every dish, drink, and diner: data.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-data-is-being-used-in-restaurants-and-food">How Data Is Being Used in Restaurants and Food</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog">BrainStation® Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BCG’s 2018 digital maturity survey of top restaurant brands found that 80 percent had access to a wealth of data. There’s a big opportunity there – BCG’s numbers found that <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#data,on-campus#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_datausedinrestaurants">data and analytics programs</a> yield five to 10 percent increases in revenue, 10 to 15 percent reductions in store-level operating costs, and 10 to 20 percent improvements in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization). Further, digital restaurant leaders’ total shareholder return has almost doubled the S&amp;P 500. And the National Restaurant Association’s 2019 State of the Industry report found that eight in 10 restaurant operators agree that the use of technology provides a competitive advantage and many planned to ramp up their efforts in that area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, data could be critical to the ongoing health of the restaurant business. An August 2018 report from The NPD Group found that the total restaurant count in the U.S. saw a one percent year-over-year decrease. Unlocking the insights of the reams of numbers available to restaurants could be crucial to their survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the ways big data has already transformed the food industry, and what further changes might be on the horizon.</span></p>

<h3><b>Inspire – and Recognize – Loyalty, While Luring Back Lapsed Guests</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it seems like every fast-casual restaurant and coffee chain has a mobile app these days, there’s a good reason – it’s a crucial way to help you order faster while also learning more about you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And restaurant and delivery mobile apps are indeed more popular than ever. BCG’s study found that the installed user base for three top apps – Starbucks, McDonald’s, and Dominos – has grown from 45 million users to 76 million from June 2016 to 2018, while the number of users with Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub leaped from 9 million to 42 million over that same period. A survey </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/483857/restaurant-apps-usage-reasons-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that most diners use restaurant mobile apps to view menus and prices (55 percent), scour deals (38.2 percent), order food (30 percent), and reserve a table (23.8 percent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BCG’s numbers, U.S. restaurant loyalty programs now also have a combined 130 million members, more than double their 2015 level – which means dining is the fastest-growing industry for loyalty programs. More than two-thirds of diners are members of at least one such program, and 25 percent say they’re members of three or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps generally have the effect of bringing customers back more often. In fact, 40 percent of app users </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-ca/publications/2018/feeding-algorithm-restaurants-use-data-capture-competitive-advantage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they increased their visit frequency after downloading. Research from BCG shows that restaurant companies with “well-defined, strategically executed” loyalty programs can boost incremental revenues by 10 to 15 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does your data play into that? Starbucks’ app is a good example. The company’s loyalty program is a gold standard for personalization, with tailored messages and offers being sent to people based on their ordering history. Starbucks often uses the program to get you in the door, whether you’re a regular – for instance, if you ordered a Venti Americano three days in a row, you might receive an email with incentives to extend your coffee streak another few days – or a lapsed customer who might be tempted back with a too-good-to-be-true deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made massive investments and made progress on personalization, ahead of what I would say other restaurant brands to date have been able to accomplish,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/personalized-fast-food-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Martin, a Partner at BCG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? Their app just keeps getting more popular – according to Starbucks’ 2019 third-quarter results, active Starbucks Rewards Membership in the U.S. increased 14 percent year-over-year to 17.2 million users.</span></p>
<h3><b>Improve Operating Efficiency</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data isn’t just being used to bring more hungry patrons into the restaurant – it’s also having a major back-of-house impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from Toast found that 78 percent of restaurant managers look at their metrics and finances daily, compared to 46 percent two years prior. And 95 percent of restaurateurs think technology improves efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of that is the fast-casual chain Panera Bread, which unveiled its Panera 2.0 plan to drive digital orders in 2014. Panera collects information about orders on all its digital channels to prepare for in-store labor and product needs, and that data has informed real changes at the chain, including redesigned kitchens and a reworked assembly line. As a result of those changes, the chain – which now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> half of all sales could soon be digital – </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-panera-solved-its-mosh-pit-problem-1496395801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut its wait time to order food from eight minutes to one minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not alone in leveraging data to smooth their operating process. Domino’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built an algorithm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to predict how long it would take to make and deliver a pizza – with factors including number and tenure of staff in the restaurant – while UberEats and DoorDash are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop the best model to predict delivery time, taking into account weather data, sports schedules, and seasonal irregularities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is also helping restaurateurs recognize their star employees – and who might be underperforming. It’s especially helpful for people managing multiple restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Charlee Williamson of the New Orleans-based Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group oversaw six managers and 78 servers on the other side of the country, at California’s Jazz Kitchen. She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Server Scorecard, offered by the restaurant management software company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avero</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ranks servers on multiple criteria and helps match the right waiter to the right table. For instance, a server who ranks higher in sales might be the right fit for a high-rolling party, while another who excels at tip percentage could be best-suited to handle a difficult table full of rowdy children.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nailing the Menu (and Finding Flavor Trends)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Applebee’s made the rather radical shift in 2016 to what was thought to be a millennial-friendly menu, it didn’t work out – to put it mildly. The chain announced in 2017 plans to close over 100 locations, and executives pointed to the fact that the youth-focused offerings had alienated what they believed to be their core guests: boomers and gen-Xers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company went back to the drawing board, they did so armed with data. Adrian Butler, the SVP and Chief Information Officer of Dine Brands (the parent company of Applebee’s), outlined a 4D technology strategy to help the restaurant regain its momentum: Data, Discovery, Dining, Delivery. The focus was on “leveraging data and analytics of our guests and operations to craft personalized experiences,” beginning with the menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applebee’s began to poll its customers via tabletop device surveys, and by the end of 2017, the chain had noticed a 7 percent uptick in overall guest satisfaction. As they dug deeper into data, they also realized why their millennial-focused menu had been such a misfire – their clientele was already evenly </span><a href="https://www.michiganstateuniversityonline.com/resources/business-analytics/dining-on-big-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">split</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among generations, with 26.4 percent boomers, 28.3 percent gen-Xers, and 29.9 percent millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data isn’t just useful for restaurants looking to make their menus shine. It also helps us understand what foods are whetting American appetites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pork lovers among us might have noticed that bacon is suddenly everywhere – in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sundaes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cocktails, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And thanks to Wired, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Food Network to analyze 49,733 recipes and 906,539 comments from their website, we learned that everything really is better with bacon. Together, they searched all the recipes that fit a certain description – pizza, for instance – and calculated the average rating for those foods that did not include bacon. They found that the recipes with bacon did score higher – and the only exceptions were among pasta and desserts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They drilled deeper and looked at other food fads and how they’ve waxed and waned over time, with ingredients like Portobello mushrooms and sriracha seemingly being past their moment in the sun. Lada Adamic, a Computer Scientist at the University of Michigan and Facebook, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wired’s research even further and found that feta, cream cheese, cranberries, strawberries, and avocado were also reliable recipe hits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate project, Adamic wanted to see if it was possible to create a predictive algorithm to see how a recipe would turn out. She and her team took nearly 50,000 recipes and 2 million reviews from allrecipes.com and created an algorithm to extract out all the ingredients, cooking methods, and nutritional profiles, then looked at how often two ingredients were paired together in the same recipe. She </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/11/19/165294248/could-nate-silver-predict-how-good-your-pumpkin-pie-will-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that her algorithm predicted with nearly 80 percent accuracy how many stars a recipe would get on the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Adamic was inspired by her own kitchen frustrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was having trouble moving beyond literally reading the recipe and then following it exactly,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, I just believe in data,” she added. “Now I feel more comfortable using spices more freely.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Improve Customer Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since few are forecasting a big leap in restaurant patronage, many restaurateurs have shifted from focusing on the number of customers to the quality of experience each visitor has – and data has been a big help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total restaurant traffic is not growing, so anything restaurants can do to offer a better customer experience differentiates them from the competition,” </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-restaurants-are-using-big-data-as-a-competitive-tool-1538515392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Portalatin, a food-industry adviser at market-research firm NPD Group Inc. and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating Patterns in America.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the primary way most restaurants are capitalizing on data to form a better bond with diners is through personalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TGI Fridays, for instance, began gathering data from point-of-sale systems, social media, credit-card transactions, and mobile devices to create personalized campaigns for the four million-plus guests who have given the company permission to contact them directly. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">result</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was stark: the chain doubled its to-go business in the 12 months leading up to August 2018 and increased social media engagement by more than 500 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gone are the days of trying to figure out what millennials want versus boomers,” </span><a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/10/10/17957350/restaurants-data-mining-personal-information-privacy-loyalty-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TGI Fridays Chief Experience Officer Sherif Mityas. “We want to know what Mary wants versus Susan, and we need an unprecedented amount of data, analytics, and machine-learning to utilize this data in the best possible way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based reservation systems allow restaurants to create detailed profiles on patrons with notes on everything from dietary restrictions to beer preferences. That information could be shared across an entire restaurant group, allowing servers to offer a customer their favorite IPA or a not-too-spicy appetizer they might love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants have numerous ways to collect that data. McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A dangle free food in exchange for diners filling out surveys rating their experience. Starbucks has always offered free wi-fi, but as of April 2018, the coffee chain </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Starbucks-wifi-policy-change-481089611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users to submit their full name, email address, and zip code before surfing the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California-based chain Tender Greens, meanwhile, uses the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Punchh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile app to log each customer’s name, email address, and purchase history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives us ways to recognize people who’ve been in regularly or haven’t been in for a while or have specific preferences,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founder Erik Oberholtzer.  “We want to accommodate everyone’s needs, sometimes before they even mention them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just fast-food or fast-casual restaurants that are using data to boost customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s Michelin-starred </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oriole</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses data from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upserve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system to determine who are their top 100 guests (in terms of the number of visits and amount spent) and creates a profile with every first-time reservation. Upserve also tracks the top 100’s dining companions when they divide up the bill, sending a list of credit-card numbers, dates of visits and what was bought. The restaurant matches the numbers to a name, then uses social media to put a face to that name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t know that someone’s going to become a regular, so you don’t necessarily keep track of those people. But the system does,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Co-Owner Cara Sandoval, adding that they’re sure to recognize regulars when they come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn’t make the reservation themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the simple fact that ordering via a mobile device – whether for pickup or delivery – is just faster and more convenient than standing in line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, restaurant digital orders have grown at an average annual rate of 23 percent since 2013 – now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">representing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3.1 billion visits and $26.8 billion – and will triple in volume by the end of 2020, according to the NDP Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Digital orders will remain an outsized source of growth for the restaurant industry over the next few years and operators who desire to grow need to embrace a digital strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2019/mobile-apps-now-represent-the-bulk-of-restaurant-digital-orders-and-restaurant-branded-apps-dominate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Portalatin.</span></p>
