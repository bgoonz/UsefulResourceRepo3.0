<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From color and mood to typography and research, there’s a lot to cover in the broad and ever-growing user experience (UX) design field. To get a better sense of the essential components, we spoke to Ann-Marie Sebastian, a Lead Educator in BrainStation’s User Experience Design Diploma program, who has been a designer for 10 years.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, without further adieu, let’s take a look at some UX design essentials.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How UX Designers Use Color</span></h2>



<h3><strong>Primary and Secondary colors</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When crafting your design, it’s standard to select sets of primary colors and secondary colors that will act as the dominant and accent colors of your design. These can all be complemented by a neutral or grayscale color selection.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Color is what many students struggle with the most during the UI phase. In order to fully understand color, you need to dive into theory, however today there are many color generators and online resources that make the process much easier.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re having difficulty, the 60-30-10 rule is a good place to start. Choose a dominant color and use it 60 percent of the time, then use a secondary color that matches the dominant one. Use an accent color (the 10 percent) sparingly, or in situations where you want to highlight content. It also helps to choose a light background (white) or dark background (dark grey) to keep things simple,” Sebastian said.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel-1024x995.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10555" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel-1024x995.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel-300x291.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel-768x746.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel-960x932.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/colourwheel.jpg 2053w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, take a look at the website of a design agency called <a href="https://waaark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waaark</a>. For their design, they decided to use a range of blues as their primary and secondary colors. The red and pink hues act as an accent to their design. Lastly, neutrals help in creating additional elements like the magnifying glass and the clothing items.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM-1024x501.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10556" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM-1024x501.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM-300x147.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM-768x376.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM-960x470.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.33.14-PM.png 1893w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Mood Boards</strong></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting a design, Sebastien suggests that you create a mood board that experiments with the feeling you want your product to instil in the viewer or user.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.34.52-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.34.52-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10557" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.34.52-PM.png 932w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.34.52-PM-300x232.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.34.52-PM-768x595.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the example below, <a href="https://cwpencils.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CW Pencils</a> is looking to inspire a fun, creative mood – one that sparks the viewer’s own creative edge. Bright pastel colors help to accomplish that.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.37.45-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.37.45-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10558" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.37.45-PM.png 959w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.37.45-PM-300x198.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.37.45-PM-768x507.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 959px) 100vw, 959px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, Kinfolk is emitting a sense of quiet, peace, and minimalism, a mood that embodies their brand and magazine’s style.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM-e1581536988935-1024x453.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10559" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM-e1581536988935-1024x453.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM-e1581536988935-300x133.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM-e1581536988935-768x340.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM-e1581536988935-960x425.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.40.05-PM-e1581536988935.png 2292w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typography</span></h2>



<h4><strong>How to Choose the Right Font</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selecting a font, pay attention to sizes, height, and whether you’re using serif or sans serif. Each element has a different effect on the feel of the content.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM-1024x419.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10576" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM-1024x419.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM-300x123.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM-768x314.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM-960x392.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-3.23.00-PM.png 2490w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has an extensive </span><a href="https://fonts.google.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Font Library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which provides a great way to explore different styles and how they work together.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When learning typography, it’s best to pick one typeface with many weights – italic, light, bold, medium, etc. Learn how to work with different weights to create visual hierarchy and to better understand balance and structure. Once you’re comfortable with that typeface, pick up another one and try the same thing,” Sebastian said.</span></p>



<h4><strong>Understanding Visual Hierarchy</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sizes are important to distinguishing hierarchy and establishing balance on a page. It’s important to UX specifically as it helps with website navigation. In the example below, you can clearly see where the eye should be drawn first. The Call to Action and title predominantly draw the eye, the rest is deprioritized secondary information.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM-915x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10561" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM-915x1024.png 915w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM-268x300.png 268w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM-768x859.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM-960x1074.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.43.54-PM.png 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The image below is a great exercise in image hierarchy – it shows how size draws the eyes in a specific order. Be sure to order information in a way that guides the reader to important information first.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.47.56-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.47.56-PM-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10563" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.47.56-PM-300x300.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.47.56-PM-150x150.png 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.47.56-PM-109x109.png 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-2.47.56-PM-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design thinking is an approach to conceptualizing and building products that solve problems while creating positive experiences for end-users. As it puts an emphasis on empathy, it is a great companion to conducting good user research and high-quality UX design.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h4><strong>Customer Empathy</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing customer empathy is an essential aspect of the design thinking process. When creating designs, prioritize a user-centric approach to uncover insights and develop marketplace solutions that fulfill your customer’s needs.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h4><strong>Prototyping and Validation</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability to build and measure success based on customer experience allows you to reap the benefits of prototyping. Validation frameworks test assumptions, confirm solutions, and maximize the efficient use of resources prior to a product launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<h4><strong>Ideation&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s essential in design thinking to formalize your ideation process so that you can identify concrete opportunities and create more innovative solutions.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on User Research</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heart and soul of UX design is user research. Knowing your customers is the key to producing a seamless user experience. From surveys to usability tests, there are over 20 different qualitative and quantitative methodologies that allow for different kinds of exploration in the UX practice.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Talk to people, observe human behavior, and test your designs – these are the basics that should be part of any project throughout the whole process. If it’s not human-centered design stemming from the needs of the people you are designing for, it can quickly become ‘self-centered design,’” Sebastian says</span></p>



<h4><strong>Design and Research</strong></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before designing, plan and conduct research to understand behavior, needs, and motivation. With formal UX training, you can learn how to communicate complex interactions visually through experience maps that feature personas. All this research culminates in wireframing and prototypes.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Design Resources</span></h2>



<h4><strong>Popular UX Design Tools</strong></h4>



<p><b>Sketch or Figma: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use either of these tools to bring your wireframes to life.</span></p>



<p><b>Invisionapp: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Invisionapp to build out a simple prototype for your designs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to create more advanced prototyping with micro-interactions, you can use&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principle, Flinto, Framer, ProtoPie.</span></p>



<p><b>Adobe: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are good companion tools for creating vectors and editing photos.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h4><strong>Online UX Design Resources</strong></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could design any app what would you create? UX Design students at BrainStation have the opportunity to turn that question into a reality as they learn how to prototype the program they wish existed.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his Certificate course project, </span><a href="https://www.zacpoissant.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zac Poissant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed to design the ultimate “all-in-one” public transit app to make commuting “easier, more efficient, and stress-free.”</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1.gif"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1-1024x768.gif" alt="BrainStation UX design project" class="wp-image-10580" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1-1024x768.gif 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1-300x225.gif 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1-768x576.gif 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1-705x529.gif 705w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/TTC-animation-V1-960x720.gif 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app like this would be appealing for many transit users, including Poissant himself, “as someone who has used the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) regularly in the past, I was motivated to solve the problems that I and others have faced when using public transit.”</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM-1024x910.png" alt="UX design project" class="wp-image-10586" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM-1024x910.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM-300x267.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM-768x683.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM-960x853.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.43.09-PM.png 1442w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poissant set out to create </span><a href="https://www.zacpoissant.com/ttc-app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow you to save your favorite routes, get directions, and identify peak traffic hours to avoid. He also wanted the app to alert transit users to any relevant transit delays all in a beautiful, easy-to-use interface.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get from idea to concept to </span><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/ed078381-c37f-49fa-725c-a2e3b1ebf788-9b36/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prototype</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Poissant followed this design process:&nbsp;</span></p>



<ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define the needs of the business</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empathize with the user and understand the problem that exists</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideate solutions that meet the needs of both</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a prototype to test and validate assumptions</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correct designs based on user feedback and repeat until the product is ready</span></li></ol>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poissant emphasizes the last two steps in the process, believing they are essential for creating a customer-centric product.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.47.49-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.47.49-PM-751x1024.png" alt="UX design process" class="wp-image-10588" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.47.49-PM-751x1024.png 751w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.47.49-PM-220x300.png 220w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.47.49-PM-768x1047.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.47.49-PM.png 870w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A useful lesson I learned in the course, is to validate our assumptions every step of the way. Test early and test often,” he says.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM.png"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM-1024x708.png" alt="UX design project" class="wp-image-10587" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM-1024x708.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM-300x207.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM-768x531.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM-960x663.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-12-at-4.42.51-PM.png 1444w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having started his career in graphic design, Poissant is well equipped to transition into a product design role. But, to help in his career development, he knew some additional skills would solidify his new position. “I&#8217;ve always been a very strong visual designer but lacked experience when it came to things like user research and how to conduct a usability test.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2vuvhEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seemed the best way to learn those additional skills.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The UX design course at Brainstation was immensely helpful in giving me the confidence I was looking for as a well-rounded Product Designer,” he says, adding that he does not want to stop there.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I plan to work on more portfolio projects that inspire me and solve needs that I, as well as others, have. An example might be a roommate app that helps users find like-minded people who share the same values and general sleep schedule. Or perhaps a budgeting app. In addition to this, I hope to continue to work on challenging projects in real life that solve real business and user needs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design and UI design sound similar — and there’s definitely some overlap — but these are also two distinct fields that really boost a team’s ability to create products that look good and work well for end-users.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UX design is a little more analytical and UI is a little more visual and more closely related to something like graphic design,” says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Designer and Web Developer Jesse Showalter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Though the two are similar in some ways, they are also very, very different.”</span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often people in these roles are working in tandem on the same team — or, at times, it’s one person wearing both hats.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But they do use different tools, different skills, and approach the problem in a different way,” Showalter explains.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting into the nitty-gritty of the two roles, let’s start with the basics.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><b>What is UX Design?&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX is referring to user experience design. It’s the process of boosting someone’s satisfaction while they’re using a particular product — be it a website or an app — by researching, analyzing, testing, and ultimately refining the design and features.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, they might study the checkout process of an e-commerce website to see whether users find the process of buying products from the website easy and pleasant,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains Jacob Gube</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Smashing Magazine.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers working in this space are looking at the bigger picture of how all the moving pieces in a product work together and how users interact with it. In short, it’s not just about how a product looks, but how someone feels while using it.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_UXDesignvsUIDesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Design courses</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></p>



<h2><b>What is UI Design?&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI stands for user interface design, and it’s a field with a narrower focus than UX. It’s also closer to traditional graphic design, though the day-to-day challenges can be more complex.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike UX designers who are concerned with the overall feel of the product, user interface designers are particular about how the product is laid out,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains Lo Min Ming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fast Company.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, they’re in charge of designing each screen or page that users interact with — and making sure it all works together and creates the experience a UX designer is aiming for.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, a UI designer creating an analytics dashboard might front-load the most important content at the top, or decide whether a slider or a control knob makes the most intuitive sense to adjust a graph,” Ming continues.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other aspects of the role could include creating a cohesive style guide, maintaining visual consistency, and working alongside graphic designers and copywriters who are creating content for the product.</span></p>



<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-interface-design#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_UXDesignvsUIDesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI Design courses</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></p>



<h2><b>UX Design Versus UI Design&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every company, there’s no question these roles are often working closely together while serving distinct purposes.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showalter puts it this way: UI without UX is like a painter “throwing paint randomly at a canvas,” hoping it looks good. UX is like a “sculpture without a frame,” with </span></p>





<p>
nothing to give the piece purpose.&nbsp;
</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, it’s not enough to approach a project with just a UI point-of-view — like picking out colors and layouts for different website pages without any research or testing to show how users actually move through the site, and how they feel about its usability.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, UX designers need UI designers to actually make their vision and research come to life through a tangible, beautiful product that people can actually use.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the roles are so interconnected, you really can’t have one without the other.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The boundary between UI and UX designers is fairly blurred and it is not uncommon for companies to opt to combine these roles,” Ming notes. </span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>User experience (UX) design is one of the most important functions in today's digital economy. The question is, what is it exactly? Find out common tasks, responsibilities, and job titles.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-ux-design">What is UX Design?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog">BrainStation® Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience (UX) Design is an essential component of today’s business world and is changing the way organizations create their products and services. Put simply, UX design is the process of building products with the user in mind. This means UX Designers must identify user needs and develop a product or service that meets them, while taking into consideration accessibility, usability, and the overall experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term “user-centered design” was first coined by Don Norman in his 1988 book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Design of Everyday Things</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Norman was the first person to have the term in their job title in his role as Apple’s User Experience Architect, and he defines UX as encompassing “all aspects of the end user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is all about creating a seamless experience throughout the entire user journey, which includes all the interaction points a customer may have when using a product, from initial intent to purchase through to product maintenance. Essentially, a UX Designer has to consider the Why, What, and How:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does someone need this product?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can they do with it?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How simple is it to use?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ‘Why’ has to do with a user&#8217;s motivations and needs for a particular product. The ‘What’ takes into consideration what a user can do with the product, it’s features and functionality. And the How primarily considers the experience – how customers will use the product, and how a UX Designer can ensure that the overall experience is as intuitive as possible.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to these questions can touch on a number of different aspects, including branding, web and product design, usability, and more. In fact, UX design is closely related to other design fields, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>User Interface (UI) design</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which concerns the stylization of the interface screens and touchpoints that a user encounters. UI design involves specific visual design choices around typography, visual elements, and micro-interactions, such as whether to provide a toggle or a button.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Interaction design (IxD)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which overlaps with both UI and UX design and which some consider a bridge of sorts between the two. Its scope is broader than UI, involving the functionality and process flow of interface elements, so interaction designers typically have front-end web development skills.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design often involves UI design and IxD, but generally, it is broader than both in that it takes the user experience into consideration before and after users are interacting with the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, UX Designers are often directly involved early on in the ideation phase of the product development process, and they may be consulted right up to product launch.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Does a UX Designer Do?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2014 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by usability expert Jakob Nielson, approximately 1,000 UX professionals reported 210 different job titles, with wide-ranging roles and responsibilities. “The strongest finding from this research,” stated Nielson, “is that there is no single defining characteristic of user experience careers.” This is because UX looks different at every organization, and varies greatly depending on the nature of the product, for example, a digital product versus a physical one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, we can still identify the key aspects of the UX design process, and the core activities and responsibilities of most UX roles. These include user research, persona development, information architecture (IA), wireframing, prototyping, and testing.</span></p>
<p><b>User Research</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people aren’t aware of how much research UX design entails. Market, product, and user research are major components of UX, as research is crucial to understanding the user and their unique needs. User research often focuses on the behavior, motivations, and needs of a customer to help the designer identify what opportunities exist in a particular market for product solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collection, surveys, user interviews, and focus groups are just some of the research methods UX Designers commonly use to gather information and insights about target users. </span></p>
<p><b>Persona Development</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of user personas is another crucial phase of the user experience design process. At this point, UX Designers consolidate and interpret their findings to construct representative personas based on patterns and commonalities in their research. The persona communicates demographic information, motivations, needs, and any other relevant information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personas are helpful as they represent particular groups of users that the product will target, and help the organization to gain a clear picture of who they are building the product for. </span></p>
<p><b>Information Architecture (IA)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Architecture is the way in which information is mapped out and organized to communicate a clear purpose. Adobe</span><a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/what-does-a-ux-designer-actually-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines IA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “the creation of a structure for a website, app, or other products, that allows users to understand where they are – and where the information they want is – in relation to their current position.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designers are responsible for building a blueprint of how information will be organized so that users encounter, navigate, and interact with the product in an optimal way. IA is a structure for the design of the product, which can be used to build wireframes and prototypes. </span></p>
<p><b>Wireframing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designers create wireframes, which are low fidelity design sketches that represent different screens or stages of the product throughout the user journey. Wireframes include simple representations of UI design elements to be used as a guide for development and product design. </span></p>
<p><b>Prototyping </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prototypes are a higher-fidelity design of the product that can be leveraged for user testing. UX Designers create prototypes that have a very similar look, feel, and capability to what is desired in the final product. Clickable prototypes are often created so that users can interact with the product and UX Designers can test the experience to identify areas for improvement. </span></p>
<p><b>Testing </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of ways that UX Designers can test products. One of the most common is user testing, which often involves allowing users to interact with your prototype and analyzing the accessibility, usability, and intuitiveness of the design. Other methods include focus groups, moderated user tests, and unmoderated user tests. Ultimately, product testing is necessary to identify what changes need to be made as you proceed with development.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience (UX) Designer — if you work in tech, it’s a job title you’re probably hearing more and more often. That’s because UX Designers can uncover insights that could make or break a product, app, or website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But good UX design can’t be done overnight. It takes time, resources, and a positive working relationship to get the most out of the UX design process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we spoke to two UX Designers (and BrainStation alumni) about how clients, colleagues, and UX Designers can work together to deliver the best possible solutions. Here’s what they had to say about misconceptions around UX design and what not to say to UX Designers.</span></p>

<h2><b>&#8220;This needs to be done today.&#8221;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking a UX Designer to do a rush job sends a signal that you don’t understand what UX design is, which isn’t a good way to start a project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of people don&#8217;t fully understand the role of a UX Designer,&#8221; says Ara An, a Product Designer who does UX and user interface (UI) work at theScore Inc. “Yes, of course we all want to make our products look awesome, but there&#8217;s a lot of research, time, and thinking behind making it pretty.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pippa Lyttle, a UX Designer at BBH New York, agrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can be hard to make people understand the value of UX Designers and that we’re actually problem solvers who go through a process that combines research and strategy to identify issues and design strategic solutions to help solve them,” says Lyttle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t know what UX design is, don’t be afraid to ask questions before starting a project (this post about </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is UX design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good place to start, too).</span></p>
<h2><b>“UX Designers create wireframes.”</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wireframes are an important part of the UX design process that illustrates what a web page or app might look like, but there’s a lot more to UX design than creating wireframes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get the request ‘Can you just quickly create some wireframes for me by end of day?’ quite often and it’s frustrating because you’re not able to go through the proper process to create meaningful design decisions,” says Lyttle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That process might include setting objectives, developing user personas, analyzing competitors, and brainstorming ideas before any design work is done on paper or on a screen. Once a prototype is in place, UX Designers also do the invaluable work of user testing which helps find ways to improve and solve problems users might run into. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My role as a UX/UI Designer is to think about the end-to-end journey with each user in mind. There&#8217;s a lot of thinking and constantly asking ‘why’ that goes into making a product look good,” agrees An. </span></p>
<h2><b>&#8220;Can you design/code/build this?&#8221;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designers can do a lot, but don’t expect them to code a website, do graphic design, and illustrations for one project. Making sure that you understand a Designer&#8217;s skillset is a good way to kick off a working relationship that&#8217;s more likely to result in an end product that makes you both look good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wish that others understood that UX Designers are not Graphic Designers. There are so many different Designer roles – UX Designer, UI Designer, UX Architect, UX Strategist, Web Designer, Motion or Interaction Designer, Illustrator, Graphic Designer – the list goes on and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some clients expect us to know it all,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; says An. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An recommends asking questions and taking the time to learn about what different types of designers do before meeting the design team. </span></p>
<h2><b>“I don’t like this color, size or shape.”</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to remember wireframes or sketches are not the final product, and that what you see will be polished later on. That’s why it’s not helpful when clients get held up details like the font, the color of a page or the size of a button on a wireframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I once had a client who would question everything from the shape of a button to the color grey we were using in our wireframes. This made the project take so much longer because we constantly had to remind the client to focus feedback on flow, function, features, and content,” says Lyttle.</span></p>

<h2><b>&#8220;I am the user/I understand the user, so&#8230;&#8221;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s almost impossible not to imagine yourself as the user of a product you’re creating, but getting sidetracked by your personal opinions can stall the UX design process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sometimes clients forget that we aren’t designing for them, but for their users,&#8221; says Lyttle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When this happens you get feedback that’s based on personal opinion and doesn’t make sense for your user, which then forces you to constantly defend your design decisions over and over again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that user research is data-based evidence that’s been gathered and analyzed with the project goals in mind. It’s the UX Designer’s job to apply that research to make the best possible design decisions.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Design &amp; Content conference is kicking off in Vancouver on July 17th, and the three-day conference offers a wide range of workshops and talks from industry leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We picked out five talks you won’t want to miss. </span></p>
<p><b>You Are Not the Target &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday, July 18 at 11:15 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this talk, Jon Crowley, the Strategy Director at SID LEE, explores the ways a target audience should impact and inform the way marketers and designers work and, more importantly, what they create. </span></p>
<p><b>Content Strategy as a Methodology &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday, July 19 at 9:10 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Loving, the Content Design Director at Publicis Sapient, looks at the expanding scope of responsibilities for Content Strategists (seen in the rise of jobs like Content Designer, UX Writer, and more), and asks if approaching content strategy as a methodology could unify this mix of content-related practices. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Content for Humanitarian Immigration Services &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, July 19 at 9:55 a.m</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this talk, Crystal Yan, the Content and Service Designer at the US Digital Service, will provide real-world examples of the impact human-centered design has had on asylum seekers, and offers key insights into how marketers can improve their content and service designs.</span></p>
<p><b>Strategic Writing for UX &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, July 19 at 10:55 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torrey Podmajersky, a UX Writer at Google, explores how UX writing is different from other forms of content, where it fits in, how to measure its impact, and where UX writers fit in the design and development process. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Safe Platforms for Marginalized Users &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, July 19 at 2:15 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Bromell, the founder of Thurst (a dating app for the LGBTQIA+ community), explores </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the process of determining what is “safe” and what security means as you develop the structure of a platform, app, product, or service that has marginalized users.  </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Sarah McVean, a Senior Product Designer and BrainStation Design Instructor. Having taught multiple courses at BrainStation including </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sarah has helped empower professionals with the skills they need – and in the process, she developed the skills she needed to take the next step in her career. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke to Sarah about the design process, landing a new role at Shopify, and what it’s like to be a BrainStation Instructor.</span></p>



<h3><b>BrainStation: Can you tell us a bit about your career background, and what you do currently?</b></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2.jpg" alt="Design Instructor" class="wp-image-8994" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2.jpg 2372w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-960x960.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 2372px) 100vw, 2372px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McVean: I’ve been a designer for 18 years, starting my career out in Multimedia with a focus on web design. I’ve done a bit of everything over the years, which has been the benefit of being a strong generalist, but my focus has typically been in the area of UX/UI for website and product design. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My most recent role was as a Senior Product Designer at KPMG’s Ignition Centre, where I led strategy, design, and Design Thinking for KPMG’s teams, partners and clients. I’m moving into a role as a UX Manager at Shopify, which I will be starting next month and am very excited about because, well, it’s Shopify and I’ll have the opportunity to grow a lot there.</span></p>



<h3><b>What drew you to the field of Product and UX Design?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About ten years ago, I began working at a software company where I worked not only on the marketing materials and website, but also on a product for food safety. The product was really interesting, and it was a natural transition for me from doing web over the years, but I had to learn how to work with complexity and UI patterns that I didn’t typically use in web. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I primarily performed UI design until I started to learn more about user research, usability testing, and UX deliverables and workflow. Once I began learning about including users in the design process, I was super excited, because otherwise design can be very subjective. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating research and data gave me the confidence to make decisions and speak to stakeholders from the needs of the users. This was a dramatic shift from the previous way I had been doing design work.</span></p>



<h3><b>In your opinion what’s the most critical aspect of a user-centric design process?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the most crucial aspect is for the designer to be able to adapt the process to meet the context of the work she is doing and fit user research in – even if it’s less than she’d like – making it measurable in some way. This will help show the value of user-centric design to the stakeholders, and get buy-in for more time and resources to perform user research. Being able to adjust your process and expectations to meet the needs of the company is key to helping to transition and implement a robust user-centred methodology. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is for the designer not to bring bias to the interview or testing process. We shouldn’t be looking for validation of our ideas but to disprove our assumptions. Designers can get attached to solutions, and designing for the user requires us to take a step back and design for their best interests, even though it may not align with what we want to create.</span></p>



<h3><b>Can you describe your experience as a BrainStation Instructor?</b> <b>What is your favourite part of teaching at BrainStation?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team here at BrainStation has always been very welcoming and supportive, and I’ve had the opportunity to make connections with students from various backgrounds and provide meaningful support and direction to new designers. Watching them grow has been very rewarding.</span></p>



<h3><b>Did working as an Instructor at BrainStation help you in your personal professional development? </b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, most definitely. I originally taught a Design Thinking workshop at BrainStation, which led me to my previous role at KPMG where I was a Senior Product Designer and Design Thinking Facilitator. I gained a lot of skills leading and facilitating sessions during the day at KPMG and in the evening at BrainStation. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of public speaking, teaching, and facilitation, I have grown exponentially. I also think that teaching at BrainStation helped me get my new role at Shopify.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m very grateful for the growth I’ve experienced while working at BrainStation.</span></p>



<h3><b>What is a teaching moment or student success story that you’re most proud of?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I think there are a few moments, but one is a Product Manager who came to learn UX because he thought his lack of wireframing and UX skills were hindering his job opportunities in the market. A few months after the course he got a new job as a Director of Product and said that the UX course was key for him getting that new role! </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another student came in with virtually no design experience and turned out a final project that was so amazing, it was on par with many experienced designers work. It was very gratifying to see someone do so well in such a short amount of time.</span></p>



<h3><b>In your experience, what do students find most challenging about the user experience design process?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think listening to feedback from usability testing and not trying to ‘explain’ designs to the user. This can be difficult sometimes, especially from designers who may have experience delivering work without any user feedback. It can be challenging to watch someone struggle with your design, so it’s a learned skill to step back and accept the feedback without getting defensive.</span></p>



<h3><b>Based on your experience working in UX, how relevant and applicable is the BrainStation approach to skills training?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the BrainStation course material and projects are a fantastic real-world introduction into current methodologies, concepts and tools. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course material is continuously being updated and worked on which is necessary since our industry is always evolving at a rapid-fire pace. And the projects themselves that students create are tangible assets that can be used towards portfolio pieces or simply for practice, and they follow the same steps that hiring managers look for when reviewing portfolios of past work. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are serious about becoming a UX designer, BrainStation is a great start, and I also encourage designers to continuously learn new skills and do design work, as the UX profession is a journey where the learning never ends.</span></p>



<h3><b>In your opinion, what are the most valuable skills a professional working in UX can develop?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication skills. This is very nuanced, and is a skill I’m always working on myself, but the ability to present your work, discuss ideas on a team, defend your designs and listen to feedback is so important. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much more to design than the pixels, and there is a balance between listening to others opinions and leading the process. Communication is a key factor in what makes a successful designer. Especially now that more teams work remotely, communication skills are really key. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I encourage everyone to put themselves into situations where they may feel uncomfortable so that there are opportunities for growth. And listen to understand, not just waiting for the opportunity to reply.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2019 edition of DesignThinkers Vancouver is kicking off next week, and some of the design industry best and brightest will be in attendance to talk shop. To help you get the most out of the event, here are six sessions you won’t want to miss:</span></p>
<p><b>Creative is Not a Noun</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; May 28 at 9:10 AM</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin Kleon, a renowned artist, speaker, and New York Times bestselling author, shares his principles for creative work in a connected world. You’ll learn to “embrace influence instead of run away from it,” to “use analog tools for better ideas,” and much more.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8945" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8945" class="wp-image-8945 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cheryl_Heller-300x200.jpg" alt="Cheryl Heller" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cheryl_Heller-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Cheryl_Heller-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8945" class="wp-caption-text">Cheryl Heller</p></div></p>
<p><b>In Regards To Beauty</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; May 28 at 11:50 AM</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design has always balanced function and aesthetic, but has the former taken over lately? Leland Maschmeyer, the co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of band and design consultancy Collins, takes a closer look and argues that beauty “will save the world.”</span></p>
<p><b>How Much Does Design Matter?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; May 29 at 4:00 PM</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers often struggle to communicate the value of the design process. How do you measure its impact? Cheryl Heller, the President of design lab CommonWise, looks at how to quantify design’s contributions, ways to explain its value, and more.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8946" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8946" class="wp-image-8946 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/moira-cullen-300x300.jpg" alt="Moira Cullen" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/moira-cullen-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/moira-cullen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/moira-cullen-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/moira-cullen-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/moira-cullen.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8946" class="wp-caption-text">Moira Cullen</p></div></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1990s, psychologist and designer Don Norman gave user experience (UX) design a name — but it was long before that when Walt Disney assembled a design team (dubbed Imagineers) to create magical experiences for amusement park guests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late 1960s, Walt Disney was in the early stages of designing Walt Disney World in Florida and described his vision for the park as “an experimental prototype that is always in the state of becoming, a place where the latest technology can be used to improve the lives of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than fifty years later, Disney’s words can be used to describe the evolving field of </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-ux-design"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the process of creating digital products and experiences that are relevant, and meaningful to the user by considering the what, why, and how.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best practices Disney’s team of Imagineers follows when designing new parks and products, and how you can apply those practices to UX design today. </span></p>

<h2><b>Always be “Plussing”</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney parks are known for delivering positive customer experiences, and that’s no small feat when you’re hosting as many as 150 million guests a year. To create the best possible experience for guests, Disney pushed his staff to go above and beyond expectations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called this “plussing,” which was the idea of constantly improving details to improve the overall experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when Disney Imagineers can’t find the technology they need, they invent it. Disney’s </span><a href="https://cdn.aboutdisneyparks.com/sites/default/files/report/file/Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering%20Fact%20Sheet_2018_Q4_0.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagineering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> department holds more than 100 patents in special effects, ride systems, interactive technology, live entertainment, fiber optics, and advanced audio systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply the “plussing it” attitude to UX design by taking a “yes, and&#8230;” instead of a “no, but&#8230;” approach and asking yourself questions like: How could I make this better? What could I do if there were no restrictions? How can I take this solution to the next level?</span></p>
<h2><b>Sketch Out a Storyboard </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most UX researchers or designers have experience sketching out a persona or a wireframe on paper or in a program like Sketch. </span><a href="https://uxplanet.org/storyboarding-in-ux-design-b9d2e18e5fab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storyboarding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walt Disney studios during the early 1930s, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">takes sketching to the next level by combining personas and wireframes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storyboards are memorable, engaging and can help us empathize with a persona, and that can be a powerful tool when communicating insights, new ideas, or data to a client or design team. Plus, they’re another cheap way to catch design mistakes early on.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a storyboard by picking a persona or character, dropping that character into a scene and then adding a few plot details that might affect the way the character interacts with the product — you might uncover new insights that will improve the user experience.</span></p>
<h2><b>Use Data to Create Magic </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before data analysis became a must for businesses, Disney looked at traffic patterns and sales data to tinker with things like the number of ice cream stands and queue designs, making him one of the first people to make data-driven business decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Disney uses a colorful, data-collecting wristband called a MagicBand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that can unlock your hotel room, buy food or merchandise with a tap, and map out the best route based on which rides you want to visit, and how busy the park is. The MagicBand even helps customers skip the worst part about visiting an amusement park: waiting in lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, according to Disney, collecting customer data doesn’t take any effort from park-goers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it works “just like magic.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is at the heart of UX design and Disney’s MagicBand is an example of how data-based personalization can lead to a magical experience for the customer by creating a unique user experience catered to every single user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designers can follow Disney’s lead by thinking about ways to integrate artificial intelligence and automated data-based decision making into the design process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<h2><b>Design Memorable Moments </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney is known for making unexpected memorable moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff is empowered to go above and beyond to solve problems in a memorable way (Disney even offers a </span><a href="https://www.disneyinstitute.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service training institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for hire), and typically tedious experiences like parking the car or standing in line for a ride are transformed into memorable moments by design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, some line-ups at Disney offer hands-on activities kids can do while waiting. Disney also recently launched a </span><a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/231550/20180702/new-disney-app-will-try-to-make-waiting-in-line-at-disney-theme-parks-more-fun.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with activities customers can do while traveling to a Disney park or waiting in line for a ride (for example, test your skills through virtual training missions while waiting to ride Space Mountain).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designers and Researchers can follow Disney’s lead by paying attention to those not-so-exciting moments (like entering your name, or </span><a href="https://medium.com/@morgane/domino-s-pizza-has-exemplary-ux-design-4208fa8aa5ab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">waiting for an order to arrive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and asking: What could transform this experience from menial to memorable?</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about the increasing demand for user experience (UX) design in cities like</span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/new-york-is-the-place-to-be-for-ux-design-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/vancouvers-tech-boom-means-more-demand-for-ux-designers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but opportunities for UX Designers are on the rise around the world. And while this is relatively new as a profession, the concept of designing something around your users is as old as antiquity itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a brief look at the history of UX design (and some key design lessons we can learn from the past).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding Harmony in the Ancient World</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about UX design, most people picture easy-to-use, free-flowing websites and mobile apps. They don’t tend to think about six-thousand-year-old Chinese philosophies. Still, there are a lot of similarities between UX design and feng shui, with some even calling the latter a form of “ancient UX design.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, feng shui does tell you to keep your toilet seat down if you don’t want to lose money. Let’s look past that. The philosophy gained in popularity, and is still being consulted, because it’s essentially focused on how to create harmony within your surroundings. According to consultant </span><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-feng-shui-1275060"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodika Tchi,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “feng shui is sometimes thought to be the art placement—understanding how the placement of yourself and objects within a space affects your life in various areas of experience.”</span></p>
<p><div style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="http://ergou.simor.ntua.gr/images/image010.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="219" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: The Ergonomics Unit</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This idea was also prevalent in Ancient Greece, where applied ergonomics, and the idea of designing objects and spaces to human characteristics, took hold. For an example, consider the Greeks’ famed theater culture, which often had citizens sitting in one spot for four consecutive plays. To make the experience more comfortable, theater seats were designed with an inward curve, which fit the shape of the lower leg. This allowed for more movement, and additional support for the lower part of the foot, making it easier to stand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ergonomics were so prevalent, that when Hippocrates wrote his suggested setup for a surgeon’s workplace, he took time to list the ideal posture, amount of light, and positioning of tools so that Physicians could “be within easy reach when required.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Da Vinci and the Power of Usability Testing </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the story goes, the Duke of Milan asked Leonardo Da Vinci to design a kitchen that would help him and his palace host an extravagant feast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Da Vinci accepted and spent a few days watching the palace cooks in action. He came up with a plan and would soon invent:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world’s first conveyor belt system, which brought ingredients and supplies out to cooks faster</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large oven that cooked food at higher temperatures </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sprinkler system, in case of fire </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also invited local artists to carve main courses into individual works of art for guests to eat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, all of this seemed incredible, but Da Vinci had failed to check if any of this actually worked and if kitchen staff wanted it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the conveyor belt proved too temperamental – first, it was too slow, then too fast, causing food to pile up. The new oven, which no one had worked with before, burned food, triggering the sprinkler system, which only ruined more food. The local artists, meanwhile, took too long to carve masterpieces out of each plate that actually managed to get out of the kitchen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything Da Vinci designed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">worked</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the staff was frustrated, guests went home hungry, and the Duke was embarrassed. The kitchen had failed in the usability department. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Da Vinci may have learned from this mistake, writing in one of his famed notebooks, “experience does not err. Only your judgments err by expecting from her what is not in her power.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylorism and Efficiency</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever felt like a small cog in a large machine, you might want to wag your finger at Frederick Winslow Taylor, the pioneer of Taylorism (the egomaniac), which focused on making human labor more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1911, he wrote “The Principles of Scientific Management,” which proposed optimizing and simplifying jobs to increase productivity, often to the detriment of human thought and individualism. Taylor’s work was often criticized – he promoted the idea of &#8220;a fair day&#8217;s pay for a fair day&#8217;s work,&#8221; with the implication that if a worker didn&#8217;t accomplish enough in a day, they didn’t deserve to be paid as much as those who had – but his ideas also included optimizing the use of tools. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, he ran a number of UX-like workplace experiments, including devising a shovel that let workers shovel for several consecutive hours and finding the motions required for a bricklayer to lay bricks – all in pursuit of improving efficiency.    </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota and Human-Powered Production</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Taylor’s work sought to simplify human output and thought, reducing them to cogs in a machine, the Toyota Production System did the opposite, putting a premium on ongoing human input.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A precursor to lean manufacturing, the Toyota Production System kept tools visible and workspaces clean, and put an emphasis on employee autonomy and involvement – factory workers could actually stop the assembly line if they had suggestions to improve the process – all to reduce costs and waste and increase worker satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system, officially called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just-In-Time manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was created by Toyota founder Kiichiro Toyoda, who believed that &#8220;the ideal conditions for making things are created when machines, facilities, and people work together to add value without generating any waste.”  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Dreyfuss and the Point of Contact</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A name that comes up often in the history of UX design is Henry Dreyfuss, an American industrial engineer. Dreyfuss believed products should be designed with common sense, and then improved and refined through hands-on experience with the product.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8105" style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8105" class="wp-image-8105 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Henry-Dreyfuss.jpg" alt="Henry Dreyfuss 300 telephone" width="288" height="388" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Henry-Dreyfuss.jpg 288w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Henry-Dreyfuss-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8105" class="wp-caption-text">Source: IDSA</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dreyfuss’ approach might have come from his upbringing: his family was in the theatrical materials supply business, and he began his design career by producing over 200 stage sets for different theatres. Clearly, he had a knack for creating functional, practical spaces, but he soon branched out. In 1929, he won a competition to design the “phone of the future,” which ended up being the  &#8220;300&#8221; tabletop telephone, with a receiver and transmitter in a &#8220;combined handset.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, Dreyfuss had a long list of successes, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A &#8220;flat-top&#8221; General Electric refrigerator, which hid the refrigeration unit beneath the cabinet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new Toperator washing machine for Sears &amp; Roebuck</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westclox&#8217;s Big Ben alarm clock</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The John Deere Model A tractor</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dreyfuss’ common sense approach to product design and refinement was informed by a number principles, including:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The belief that the more users are exposed to well-designed products, the more their expectations grow. Designers have to stay ahead of their expectations. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The designer’s role is to advocate for the user at all times and provide an impartial voice in corporate boardrooms. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the user experience, a designer has to understand the user, the manufacturing process, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the market.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1955, Dreyfuss wrote Designing for People, which sums up it all up this way: “When the point of contact between the product and the people becomes a point of friction, then the [designer] has failed. On the other hand, if people are made safer, more comfortable, more eager to purchase, more efficient—or just plain happier—by contact with the product, then the designer has succeeded.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney’s Imagineers Create Experiences</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe it or not, Walt Disney is often described as one of the first UX designers in history. To build his theme parks, Disney assembled a design team (dubbed Imagineers) to create immersive, magical user experiences.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-8107 alignleft" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Imagineering-study-model-for-Spaceship-Earth-show-at-Epcot-300x200.jpg" alt="Walt Disney Imagineering Epcot" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Imagineering-study-model-for-Spaceship-Earth-show-at-Epcot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Imagineering-study-model-for-Spaceship-Earth-show-at-Epcot-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish that, he stressed that his team followed a number of  </span><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/walt-disney-the-worlds-first-ux-designer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The idea that they should “always be plussing”</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney encouraged his team to bring something more than what was asked. He called this “plussing,” which was the idea of constantly improving details to improve the overall experience. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Give users options</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney’s idea to create different areas, with different themes, within his parks is something that echoes different UIs available today: it gives people options and appeals to a wider range.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Use data to improve</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney looked at traffic patterns and sales data to tinker with things like the number of ice cream stands and queue designs, making him one of the first people to make data-driven business decisions. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Test everything</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disney used to send friends and family on rides before they opened to the general public. He then asked for feedback and made adjustments. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xerox and the Need for Simplicity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1970s, Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) attracted some of the best Engineers and Computer Scientists of the era, including Ralph Kimball, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the original architects of data warehousing.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8110" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8110" class="wp-image-8110 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/parc-300x237.jpeg" alt="XEROX PARC team in the 1970s" width="300" height="237" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/parc-300x237.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/parc-768x606.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/parc.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8110" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Liar City</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margy Ross, the President of DecisionWorks Consulting, once described Kimball’s work at the time, which would set the stage for UX design for decades to come:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contrary to most product development practices at the time, a guiding principle for Ralph and his colleagues was to focus first on the user experience, then back into the design of the underlying hardware and software. They tried to follow the advice of their PARC colleague, Alan Kay: the simple things should be simple; complex things should be possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this approach, PARC’s team went on to develop a number of innovations that still impact us, including client-server computing, the Ethernet, laser printing, bitmapped graphical user interfaces (GUI) with windows and icons, the mouse, object-oriented programming, and more. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald Norman and a Larger System</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on the work of Xerox and PARC, Apple released the original Macintosh in 1984. The mass-market PC featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and a mouse, and had a unique design approach that set it apart. Steve Jobs “wanted to elevate Apple by using design,” and it would end up informing the way the entire company operated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody there is thinking about UX and design, not just the designers. And that’s what makes everything about the product so much better . . . much more than any individual designer or design team,” Mark Kawano, a former Senior Designer, </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3030923/4-myths-about-apple-design-from-an-ex-apple-designer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">once said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense, then, that someone at the company would coin the term “user experience design.” That person was Donald Norman, a Cognitive Scientist, who joined Apple in the early 90s. His official title was User Experience Architect, which made him the first person to have UX in his job title. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow: I wanted to cover all aspects of the person’s experience with a system, including industrial design, graphics, the interface, the physical interaction, and the manual.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8111" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8111" class="wp-image-8111 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/don-norman-1024x536.jpg" alt="Don Norman" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/don-norman-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/don-norman-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/don-norman-768x402.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/don-norman-960x502.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/don-norman.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8111" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Nielsen Norman Group</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach provided the blueprint for Apple’s success over the last 25 years, from the design of the first iPods to the company’s physical stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1988, Norman published </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Psychology of Everyday Things</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (also known as The Design of Everyday Things), which, looking back, might not have seemed so out of place in Ancient Greece&#8230;</span></p>
