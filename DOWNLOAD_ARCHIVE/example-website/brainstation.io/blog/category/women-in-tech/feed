								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Women in Digital Leadership | Shaping Stronger Pathways</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 25th, and featured a stellar lineup of women in digital leadership representing Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics and Instacart.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/529460562" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>



<p>As the tech industry grows, women are making up a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before – but much work remains to be done. While equitable participation across the industry as a whole is a laudable benchmark, it’s not enough. Representation in every job category and at all levels of seniority remains a challenge. Many of the obstacles to better representation in digital leadership are structural, and will require structural changes to fix. Fortunately, there are programs in place, and as their success in helping women achieve positions of leadership grows, so too does the opportunity to kick off a virtuous cycle. </p>



<p>The event lineup included six women in positions of leadership at prominent global companies: Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics, and Instacart. Together, our panelists weighed in on the importance of the initiatives already in place, issues that still need to be confronted, and what can women do as individuals to advance themselves and others in their careers. These are just a few of the many great points that arose during our discussion.</p>



<h2><strong>Mentorship Is the Key to Bridging the First Step</strong></h2>



<p>The transition into management can be an especially difficult one for women – an early inequality that can impact women’s careers over the long term. Shelli Brunswick, Chief Operating Officer at The Space Foundation, explains, “As you’re looking to make that first step on the ladder to being a leader, finding a mentor, a champion, and a coach can be critical..”. She also emphasizes the importance of paying it forward, saying that “once you have a mentor, always remember that you can be a mentor to and help the next generation behind you.”</p>



<p>Often, finding a mentor begins with networking. As Vice President of Product Innovation at Verizon Sanyogita Shamsunder says, “Be open, be collaborative, communicate, go talk to others about their projects and show genuine interest in their work. And get help. The first person that you approach may not may not be open or receptive, but don’t give up. Keep talking to people, both men and women, junior to you, senior to you – it doesn’t matter. We need to communicate. There’s no substitute for that.”</p>



<p>But besides being open to all networking opportunities, what can we do to find mentors – especially the right ones? To start with, it can’t hurt to ask. “You should always be looking for people that you have an affinity with, who really believe in you, and who are willing to go to bat for you when times are tough,” says Frida Polli, CEO &amp; Co-founder of A.I.-powered recruitment platform Pymetrics. “You definitely need to be reaching out to those folks…Just continually be looking for folks that appreciate and believe in what you’re doing.”</p>



<p>Still, approaching a possible mentor can be intimidating. As Tehmina Haider, Vice President and Head of Harry’s Labs at Harry’s Inc., says, “When you ask someone to be a mentor, you’re asking them for their time. The more senior they are, the more precious their time is. So it is a big ask, [but] most leaders actually enjoy seeing other people grow; that’s why they became leaders.” And overcoming your reluctance to approach mentors will pay off: “You need folks who can supplement you in different ways, to have that diversity. Women, because they tend to identify with other women, do often reach out to a female mentor, but you want your mentors to have different points of view than you do. And that’s where pushing for those male mentors is really, really important. So take that leap.</p>



<p>Vice President of Digital &amp; Cybersecurity Solutions at Mastercard Sukhmani Dev concurs, and emphasizes that finding a mentor is sometimes a question of timing. “Things happen organically as you grow forward. I find that [potential mentors] need to have a sense of who you are and what you’re capable of, and have seen you in action…If I really enjoyed working with a boss of mine, and then I’m changing roles or they’re changing roles, I may ask them, ‘Let’s continue the dialogue.’ It was more of a formal ask when I was more junior…but [where I am now], you just call them up when you have a question.”</p>



<p>Darrah Joy-Clay, Account Director of CPG Brands at Instacart, encourages women to ask for what they need. “As I’ve grown in my role, I find that the negotiations become a lot more complex. And when I’m going through a negotiation, of course I consult my female mentors. But it’s my male mentors who really give me that extra level of confidence, and re-emphasize not to be shy or fearful of making an ask of what I’m deserving of, or what I need to be happy and fulfill my role.”</p>



<h2><strong>Support Isn’t Just a Relationship – It’s Also a Culture</strong></h2>



<p>Advocating for yourself is important – but so is advocating for each other. How can companies help to support their female employees and foster a culture that supports women? Several panelists mentioned how important it is to carve out space for women to speak, to encourage them to speak, and to draw attention to their contributions and successes, which can get overlooked in environments structured around male authority. As always, mentorship is important. But even the way we provide day-to-day feedback can help, though criticism can be hard to receive – and to give.</p>



<p>As Haider explains, delivering criticism is about “making sure that the women on your team understand that the feedback that you’re giving them, even if it’s sometimes not that great to hear, is coming from a place of really caring about them. And that’s really hard, as a leader. Giving difficult feedback is not the easiest thing to do, but you’ve got to invest in it, and you’ve got to make sure that folks understand why it’s actually an indication of how much you care.”</p>



<p>For Joy-Clay, that’s aided by an environment where leadership is able to be transparent and talk about their own successes and failures without fear of judgment. “When I share my journey to leadership and I’m transparent with my teams, they can identify and relate with some of the experiences that I’ve had,” she says. “Several mentors of mine who have, one, shared their personal journey with me. But secondly, they’ve exposed me to communities and to rooms and to opportunities that I may not have been in before…and that exposure, I think, is a huge opportunity for leaders and mentees.”</p>



<h2><strong>Policies Need to Acknowledge There Are Many Paths</strong></h2>



<p>While cultivating a supportive environment may seem like an enigmatic exercise, it ultimately comes down to the policies a company puts in place. As Shamsunder says, “One of the first things that we have to do to create programs [to support women] is to recognize that there is an inequality.” This often starts with highlighting the different ways that people contribute to the company – including people with different levels of educational attainment, people in different locations.</p>



<p>There are many paths to STEM, and overlooking some in favor of others is detrimental to employees following unorthodox paths, which often includes women. At Mastercard, Dev explains, “We have a particular program that [assists] women who want to change their careers midway through – nurturing that and helping them explore different areas, explore technological areas.”</p>



<p>Spreading opportunity around isn’t as simple as promoting women up the corporate ladder. And it doesn’t happen by accident. At The Space Foundation, Brunswick says, they take a multi-pronged approach specifically designed to tackle the problem from different angles: raising awareness of careers in STEM, providing more people with access and training, helping to connect potential STEM workers to opportunity, and finally, mentoring to encourage equity in leadership. “Our goal at the Space Foundation is to highlight all those career paths. And we would say it’s about diversity and inclusion, but those underrepresented groups could be rural communities or inner cities, as well as regions of the world.” Matching protégés to mentors is an important step, but it’s just one of many; promoting more women into digital leadership roles in STEM means nurturing an entire talent pipeline that begins with reaching out to girls early in their education and letting them know that they can find a place in STEM.</p>



<p>And more women in STEM is good not only for women: “What we’ve learned is when women around the world are empowered to be entrepreneurs, they elevate not only themselves but their families and their communities as well,” Polli says. “It’s valuable to our entire world and ecosystem to empower women, to provide them the financing and support them in becoming entrepreneurs.”</p>



<h2><strong>Confidence Can Be a Greater Obstacle Than Competence</strong></h2>



<p>Confidence looks different in different people, and in situations with a gender imbalance, women may be at a disadvantage. Here, leadership can help to rebalance the scales, for example, by specifically calling on younger talent to speak up. “Leaders have a key role to play. If you’re on a table where you have young talent and they’re not speaking up, it’s your responsibility to pause and ask them for their point of view, create a space that they feel comfortable in…We can just take two minutes out of our time as leaders to convey that to younger talent. You’ll make them that much more comfortable and confident going forward and feel like their voice is appreciated,” Dev says.</p>



<p>For that younger talent, learning to overcome fear&nbsp; takes practice. “One [strategy] is to give more time and attention to your emotional skills, in terms of developing yourself and your emotional responses to rejection, to negative consequences,” Joy-Clay advises. “If we develop that muscle, that emotional response will be less fearful of what the consequences are on the other end.” This becomes ever easier the more willing leadership is to make space for failure and drop the expectation of perfection. “We have to start speaking more about our failures,” Joy-Clay continues. “If we talk more broadly about the mistakes we’ve made, the failures we’ve had, that would empower more young female leaders to not be afraid to fail, and not be afraid to be their authentic selves in the workplace.”</p>



<p>To Polli, it’s less a question of having confidence and more about how men and women project their confidence differently. “What it means to look confident is actually a very male image,” she says, explaining that what may seem like a lack of confidence is actually a decision not to project overconfidence. The solution is “more about having enough women in positions of leadership that can present an alternative image of what confidence looks like, rather than everyone feeling like, ‘I need to fit the mold of male confidence.’”</p>



<p>On one hand, Haider says, “It’s about pushing women to be confident, be bold, and really demonstrate that confidence externally. But it’s also about changing the metrics that we have around what confidence is, so that the way women show up also feels resonant.”</p>

<p>The<strong> Women in Leadership: Shaping Stronger Pathways </strong>panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on June 11th, and professionals around the world tuned in to discuss the challenges women face in the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/428532819" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>While career opportunities for women have increased over the years, women are underrepresented at every level in the corporate pipeline, but especially in senior leadership; Only 21 percent of C-suite positions are filled by women.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A study by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org found that for every 100 men promoted or hired at the manager level, only 72 women were hired or promoted to manager. The gender difference is so great that researchers claim this first step up to manager –&nbsp;often referred to as the “broken rung” –&nbsp;is the biggest obstacle women face on the path to senior leadership positions, with women in marginalized communities facing multiple broken rungs.</p>



<p>There are, however, a number of initiatives organizations can take to strengthen and diversify their talent pipeline and shape stronger pathways for women into leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Help Close the Confidence Gap</h2>



<p>A survey of British Managers found that half the female respondents reported self-doubt in their job, compared with fewer than a third of male respondents. Another study found that men overestimate their abilities and performance, while women underestimate both. This has a direct correlation with career advancement, as women are 26 percent less likely to ask for a job referral than men, even when they are qualified. As per the oft-quoted stat: Men apply for a job if they meet 60 percent of the qualifications, while women will only apply if they meet 100 percent of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Women are often taught that we need to be humble and silent about our accomplishments. We have a lot of fear when it comes to speaking up and asking for the things that we deserve, but rather than having that fear, we need to have the audacity to put our hands up, ask for referrals, apply for roles we might not have all the qualifications for,” Danica S. Nelson, a Senior Marketing Communications Manager at Telus said, adding that it’s important to acknowledge and share the effects of <em>imposter syndrome</em>.</p>



<p>“I face imposter syndrome on a weekly basis, and we need to make it very clear to people who see us on panels or in leadership positions that hey, I’m afraid a lot of the time too, I’m not 100 percent confident,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Catherine Hunter, the Advisory Partner and Technology Transformation Leader at EY, believes there are a number of things organizations can do to help women close the “confidence gap” that may be fueling imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve probably all felt imposter syndrome at some point in our career, but there are lots of little things organizations can do to help. This concept of exec presence, and helping people feel more confident when they’re in a room with others in terms of how you present, how you speak, the content of the material, those sorts of things can help people if they feel they may need more support,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hunter also suggests senior leaders provide opportunities to boost the confidence of their more junior colleagues. </p>



<p>“Offering people opportunities where they feel they can succeed in turn helps build confidence,” she said explaining that confidence can help employees turn their ideas into action.</p>



<h2>Let Go of Perfect</h2>



<p>Numerous studies have shown that women in the workplace often ruminate over their own mistakes, leading to stress levels that are up to 67 percent higher than men.&nbsp;“These are the pressures you place on yourself,” Clinical Psychologist Dr. Jessamy Hibberd, Co-Author of <em>This Book Will Make You Calm</em>, told the Guardian. “For example, checking and rechecking work, spending too long on each task, taking work home, and setting excessively high standards.”</p>



<p>An organization’s culture, and paradoxically, a focus on finding the optimal work-life balance may be increasing the pressure women impose on themselves. When asked about balancing work and life and setting the tone for her team, Tonia O’Connor, CEO of Chopra Global said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t believe in balance. Balance suggests perfection and perfection is not achievable. I don’t want anyone to think it is because you’ll continue to strive for that and feel inadequate. I always say I’m perfectly out of balance.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That imperfection, in fact, might be an advantage. Monika Saksena, the Director, Global Partnerships and Tools at Google, argues that women should continue to tap into their more reflective nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think one asset we have as women is vulnerability. We can bring our whole selves more easily, so I think being open and being transparent and bringing our whole selves to work sets the tone,” she said.</p>



<h2>Encourage Mentorship and Sponsorship </h2>



<p>Saksena believes that providing mentorship opportunities can help strengthen pathways for women in leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Peer mentorship is essential. The value of talking to someone in the same boat and figuring those stories out is huge,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is, however, important to remember that mentorship is a two-way street.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Just because you might be a junior exec in an organization, don’t think that you don’t have mentorship or something to offer to executives who might be above you, especially living in the digital times,” said O’Connor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everyone has a role to play as a teacher and as a student.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>O’Connor argues that sponsorship – where a senior colleague advocates for junior or women employees and supports their growth – may be just as important as mentorship.</p>



<p>“Men are often promoted on their potential when women are promoted on their track record and demonstrated success. So it’s important to sponsor women, even if they don’t check all the boxes for desired roles,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encouraging a culture of sponsorship, however, can be challenging. Many employees look to company leaders to set the tone, but what steps can they take?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A big part of my leadership role is to challenge male counterparts on active sponsorship of underrepresented individuals in our organizations,” said Serena Nguyen, the Director, Talent&nbsp;Experience and Strategy at MaRS Discovery District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re putting yourself out there and challenging the status quo. It’s a difficult and uncomfortable conversation sometimes, but if you anchor it in respect and the facts of what you&#8217;re seeing, it goes a long way to bring others into this journey of sponsorship,” she said.</p>



<p>Danica Nelson of Telus agrees but also encourages women to continue self-advocating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’ve just learned that we have to be our own cheerleader and our own PR team because we won&#8217;t always have people to speak up for us. We really have to take on that role and pick up the mic ourselves sometimes,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hunter echoed the sentiment, reflecting on what she might have done differently in her first Manager role. “I could have asked more questions and sought out mentors,” she said, adding that if there is a bright side, it’s that women now have more resources available to them – and it’s only increasing with time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m seeing more supportive networks and groups where women can come together, speak openly and candidly, seek out mentors, and also seek out sponsors.”</p>



<p>The future, after all, is female.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although women now make up half the workforce in the United States, it&#8217;s a well-known fact that the tech industry is dominated by men. According to Adeva, women hold about 25 percent of tech roles and that number drops even lower when looking at the number of women working in leadership roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help inspire the next generation of tech leaders and innovators, we&#8217;re featuring five women who are leading the way in the UX design industry for International Women&#8217;s Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From women who are breaking into the industry to UX leaders at some of the world&#8217;s most recognizable companies, here are some of the women who are championing diversity and acting as mentors in their field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Elizabeth Churchill&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10703" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10703" class="wp-image-10703 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10703" class="wp-caption-text">Source: EPIC</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no denying Churchill</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a female leader in UX design. With more than 20 years of experience, this Google exec has seen the industry come a long way and she&#8217;s not afraid to call out the idea that emotions are a female-only trait as &#8220;of course, nonsense.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Acknowledging emotional intelligence and emotionality as being fundamentally human means both men and women benefit in the long run,&#8221; said Churchill in an interview with </span><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-series-of-interviews-with-senior-ux-leaders-to-celebrate-international-womens-day-10dc6e354f26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her role as the Director of UX for Google&#8217;s Material Design (where she has five female and five male reports on her team), Churchill has also worked at tech giants including Yahoo!, Fuji Xerox, and eBay. Plus, she&#8217;s had a long academic career, written books about the design field, and is the current Secretary/Treasurer of the Association for Computing Machinery, the world&#8217;s largest scientific and educational computing society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Lizzie Kelly-Dyson and Georgie Bottomley</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10713" style="width: 898px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-duo-copy-e1583509846882.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10713" class="size-full wp-image-10713" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-duo-copy-e1583509846882.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="300"></a><p id="caption-attachment-10713" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Twelve Scholars and georgiebottomley.com</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Manchester-based Lizzie Kelly-Dyson and Georgie Bottomley wanted to meet more women in the UX design industry, they decided to do something about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started</span><a href="https://www.ladiesthatux.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladies That UX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because we didn&#8217;t know any women in the industry. Around eight people turned up for our first meeting, which was amazing because that&#8217;s eight people that we&#8217;ve never met before,&#8221; said Kelly-Dyson on a podcast called</span><a href="https://hubhopper.com/episode/lizzie-kelly-dyson-step-outside-your-comfort-zone-1579180067"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve Scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of the UX meetup quickly spread and today there are more than 30 Ladies That UX groups in cities across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. There&#8217;s no set format for a meeting, but each Ladies That UX group has a common theme: a community of women in UX who support each other, push the UX boundaries, and promote female skill and talent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope that every woman has the chance to achieve more through knowing she is not the only one out there, and by finding support in our community,&#8221; said Bottomley about the networking community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Jessica Gaddis</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10705" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10705" class="wp-image-10705 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10705" class="wp-caption-text">Source: jmgaddis.com</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite growing up with parents who worked in the industry and learning how to code at a young age,</span><a href="http://www.jmgaddis.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaddis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t see herself working in tech. It wasn&#8217;t until she pursued worked on a digital storytelling project in journalism school that she started to consider a career in the tech industry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Gaddis landed a product design role at Netflix and now works as a Product Designer at Twitter. In an interview for</span><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/interviews/women-ux-meet-jessica-gaddis-former-journalist-turned-self-taught-product-designer-netflix/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe&#8217;s XD Idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog, she spoke about some of the challenges of being a black woman in UX design, including a lack of awareness that UX jobs exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m passionate about giving young women all of the opportunities, all of the knowledge, and all of the information to make more informed decisions about their roles. Even if no one goes into design that’s a black woman ever again, I want women to be able to make those decisions for themselves and know that there is stuff out there for them that maybe they wouldn’t account for, or they wouldn’t even strive to,” said Gaddis.</span></p>
<h2><b>Julie Zhou&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10706" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10706" class="wp-image-10706 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10706" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Diversity in STEAM</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve used Facebook in the past ten years there’s a good chance </span><a href="https://www.juliezhuo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Zhou</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played a role in your experience. Zhou is Chinese-American woman who started as an intern at Facebook and, over 14 years, moved her way up to the Vice President of Product Design position. She has since left Facebook and turned her attention to the publishing and public speaking world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite achieving success at a young age, Zhou was not immune from a common experience many women in the tech industry face: the imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Experience makes anything look easy, but insecurities never fully disappear. This is true for everyone, especially true for women, and truer still for women in male-dominated fields,” said Zhou on </span><a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhou faced those feelings head-on in her much-loved book released last year, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check it out to find out more about Zhou’s experience of being a leader at a young age and how to unlock your confidence even when you feel like you don’t know what you’re doing.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no question boosting diversity is welcomed by workers in the tech industry and beyond — and experts say it&#8217;s even </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-is-gender-balance-so-important-for-companies-and-how-can-they-improve-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good for business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, helping support innovation, productivity, and engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more tech companies are striving to become inclusive in a variety of ways, including some that are thinking well outside the box.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies Big, Small Striving for Inclusivity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American tech hardware company Cisco, for instance, is known for backing full-spectrum diversity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an approach that en</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">courages diversity at all levels of the company — inclusive of gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, or pretty much anything else — and the company says it uses its own technology to ensure all employees can &#8220;participate in the business.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That company-wide push has helped Cisco become the most diverse its ever been since they first started tracking diversity back in 1998, and helped the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multinational jump from 7th to 2nd place on Fortune&#8217;s ranking of best workplaces for diversity in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech giant Microsoft also says it has made major strides in the last two decades through deep, widespread diversity initiatives, ranging from efforts to increase broader representation in its overall employee base to offering equal pay for similar work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By mid-2019, the company says it has seen gains in the diversity of employees, including those in tech and leadership roles. Women, in particular, are being hired more often, bucking a decades-long tech industry trend, with female employees now representing 37 percent of the company&#8217;s executives responsible for leading geographic markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on a smaller scale, California-based cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks is boosting diversity through strategic partnerships and educational programs, which helps to ensure that jobs at the company are more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yearly pay equity analyses through a third-party firm also help ensure there aren&#8217;t any unexplained pay differences between employees, the company says.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Still Needed to Boost Diversity, Experts Say</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these types of initiatives are good news, experts say, though some warn much more needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imogen Coe, a Professor in the faculty of science at Ryerson University in Toronto — who&#8217;s known for her </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63xTTTYWEQ8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 TEDx talk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Change the Numbers: Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity in STEM&#8221; — says there still needs to be more intentional efforts from leadership in the tech sphere.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63xTTTYWEQ8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to be supportive, and that&#8217;s great, and we&#8217;re seeing more allyship, but that allyship has to be actionable,&#8221; she stresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s important to remember is that diversity touches the whole organization and every employee, which means advancing it requires continuous effort and resources, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katja Toropainen, the Founder of Inklusiiv, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Finland nonprofit with a mission to advance diversity and inclusion in working life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are a lot of different [diversity and inclusion] best practices that can be implemented — be that in leadership, work culture, product development, recruiting or marketing comms,&#8221; she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">osting unconscious bias training for employees, paying attention to inclusive language, branding, and marketing, and decreasing biases in recruitment processes are all useful strategies, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toropainen adds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why not strive for it? Coe says there&#8217;s no downside, and plenty to gain, from a corporate perspective.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;It&#8217;s About Human Talent&#8217;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ultimately, it&#8217;s about human talent, it&#8217;s about intellectual capacity and brainpower&#8230; if you&#8217;re missing out on rich diversity, you&#8217;re missing out on brainpower, ideas, solutions,&#8221; Coe notes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toropainen agrees boosting diversity can be good for recruitment — and she says it&#8217;s just the right thing to do, given tech&#8217;s long history as an industry with &#8220;structural barriers, strong stereotypes and biases that make it more difficult for women and other marginalized groups to enter the industry or pave their way there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also crucial given how fast-growing and powerful the industry could be in the years ahead, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tech solutions affect our everyday life from communications to mobility to food to health and whatnot,&#8221; says Toropainen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s why it’s increasingly important that these technologies are inclusive, designed for the needs of diverse people.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>What are your main tasks as a Product Designer?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Product Design Manager at Shutterstock, I’ve transitioned from an individual contributor-focused role to a primarily managerial role. My main tasks are creating alignment with the teams I work with, defining product design strategy, and supporting my direct reports and the UX team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means there are a lot of meetings on my calendar these days, but I’m also finding ways to carve out time for strategic ideation, and to pore over the latest customer feedback, which fuels the aforementioned ideation.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some big projects you’ve worked on, or are currently working on at Shutterstock?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year I had the opportunity to bring to life one of my favorite projects I’ve ever worked on: a brand new homepage for our returning customers, with a focus on personalization. The project is ambitious in that it is attempting to change customers’ expectations of what a stock content website can offer them. Several rounds of user research led to the final design that we shipped, and I’m proud to say it’s a wholly user-centric experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big project I’m working on currently is consolidating our customer feedback in one single, searchable platform, to empower our teams to make strategic decisions with customer needs top of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the above, I’ve also been facilitating a number of coding workshops for the Shutterstock UX team. The goal is to empower our Designers to build their own experiments, create more complex, real-world prototypes, and to foster more effective communication and collaboration between Designers and Developers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for keeping a product fresh and relevant? How do you decide what features to push forward?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to really listen to your customers. Conduct user research, and do it as often as you can. Eventually, you’ll start to see the patterns and common pain points, and you’ll understand them so deeply that the ideas you push forward are not only addressing those pain points but are also innovative. To truly be fresh and relevant, one piece of advice I always share with new Designers on the team is to spend more time analyzing and understanding the tech industry at large beyond just Shutterstock’s direct competitors.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10641 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-1024x521.png" alt="screenshot of shutterstock personalized home page" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-1024x521.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-300x153.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-768x391.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM-960x488.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-2.19.52-PM.png 1327w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What teams do you collaborate with to take a product from ideation to completion?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a daily basis, I collaborate with several of our product pods (made up of Product Managers, Designers, and Engineers), as well as my UX family within the company. Outside of those teams, I work closely with our Global Customer Care team, who has a direct line to our customers, as well as our data analytics, marketing, and content teams.</span></p>
<p><strong>What role does user research play in product design at Shutterstock?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User research is a huge part of our product design efforts. We support all of our Designers in planning and conducting their own research. We’re constantly optimizing our research process to diversify when and how we talk to customers, and how we capture and share feedback in an impactful way.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, we’ve placed emphasis on bringing the customer feedback to project stakeholders in the form of soundbites and video highlight reels, so that it truly resonates and creates empathy. When you’ve got everyone on the same page, it’s much easier to agree on a way forward, and translate that into a user experience that actually gets shipped.</span></p>
<p><strong>Have you had any mentors? If so, in what ways did they help you develop your career?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people that have deeply inspired me have mostly been from outside the design industry. I had an Art History professor in college who I really looked up to, whose passion for life and art was infectious. She was in her sixties at the time, and, as an underwater archaeologist, she spent every summer diving in search of ancient shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. I went out of my way after my first class with her to take her more advanced course on Greek art history and ended up becoming her in-class Greek translator. She taught me how to appreciate art. I think of her often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my first couple of years at Shutterstock, I had a colleague that I worked with closely who mentored me on how to give thoughtful feedback. I learned a lot from him and I believe I’m a more effective manager because of having worked with him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10643" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-1024x576.jpg" alt="picutre of noguchi working on art piece" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/noguchi.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Who are some creators or industry professionals that you’re inspired by?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m inspired by multidisciplinary Artists and Designers who have found ways to create without compromising on method, medium, and vision; especially those who have blurred the lines between applied and fine arts. I’m a jack-of-all-trades, generalist of sorts who wants to make many things in many forms, and I aspire to someday be able to do that without being limited by my professional circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design legends like Isamu Noguchi as well as Charles and Ray Eames are huge inspirations. Among contemporary Designers, a few that come to mind are Designer/Maker Andrew Neyer, Joseph Guerra and Sina Sohrab of Visibility Studio, and creative partnerships like the New York-based Egg Collective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m also a huge admirer of Designer and writer Craig Mod. Craig’s views on technology as a self-described “skeptical technology optimist” align with, while often challenging, my own evolving feelings on technology and how it affects and shapes our lives.</span></p>

<p><strong>How does Shutterstock encourage new ideas and creative thinking in the workplace?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Product and UX teams regularly run design sprints to explore new ideas centered around important initiatives. The format is such that it allows breakthroughs in approach that are a few steps beyond just simple iteration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company, we also have twice-a-year hackathon events where cross-functional teams come together to build new and exciting things. Many of the projects that have come out of our hackathons have gone on to become part of the Shutterstock platform. For example, our “view in room” augmented reality feature for mobile which went into production shortly after being presented as a hackathon project.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_1496-e1582750994275.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10565" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_1496-e1582750994275-1024x862.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="505" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_1496-e1582750994275-1024x862.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_1496-e1582750994275-300x253.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_1496-e1582750994275-768x647.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_1496-e1582750994275-960x809.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Are there any unexpected everyday things that have inspired you while designing something new?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my favorite things to do when starting something new is sketching my ideas on paper before doing anything digitally. I find that the format helps me put things down quickly without thinking about any of the details too much. With that kind of ease and speed, an initial idea can turn into several offspring ideas in the span of a few minutes. This method, a kind of brainstorm conversation between myself and the paper, often leads me down unexpected, but always promising, paths.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are your favorite resources to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in product design?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been a subscriber of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidebar.io</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> daily newsletter for years. It’s a good combination of industry-specific resources and inspiring miscellaneous content. I also really enjoy the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track Changes podcast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the folks at Postlight; the conversations are candid and insightful, and the guests are top notch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What’s an old design trend you wish would become popular again?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn’t one specific design trend that I wish to see return, but, in general, I’d like to see more diversity in user interface design. I was there when CSS Zen Garden became </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> destination for web design inspiration (how old does that make me?), and I was very inspired by it. By contrast, the web is looking very uniform these days, and even though that has come with benefits for users and product teams alike, it’s also stifling creativity in many ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tooling for building websites has gotten so complicated that we spend too much time figuring out how to improve loading times, and there’s nearly no time left for testing the waters with new and unexpected things. I’m not suggesting we should trade one for the other; I’m saying we need to shift the balance back toward creativity. To clarify even further, that doesn’t mean to cram more stuff, more animations, or more illustrations on a webpage, but rather to boldly consider taking away stuff, however one defines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stuff</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their own role. To be creative means to think differently, then apply that thinking in the interfaces we design.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10644 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie.jpg" alt="hans wegner designing chair porotype" width="333" height="229" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie.jpg 333w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HANS-J-WEGNER_20copie-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite product, service, or experience that gives you design envy?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well designed, timeless furniture will do that for me. Take almost any chair designed by Hans Wegner, for instance. On the digital side of things, I’ve been surprised by how quickly I’ve gotten accustomed to using Apple Pay when I’m out and about. It’s so quick and seamless. It’s amazing because multiple pieces of hardware and software have to learn to speak to each other for this particular interaction to work, and the Designers and Engineers at Apple have pulled it off really well, in my opinion.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today and every day, it’s important to celebrate the diverse achievements of women everywhere and to continue raising awareness about gender imbalances and inequalities that exist in the tech industry. Females<span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently account for less than 20 percent of <strong>all</strong> technology jobs in the US and only seven percent of venture capital partners. </span></p>
<p>The question is, how do we address this? We&#8217;ve written about how <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-in-demand-skills-that-can-make-you-a-digital-leader/">digital skills</a> and <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-design-thinking-makes-you-a-better-leader">design thinking</a> can make you a better leader, but what about becoming a leader in the first place? A<span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to Kalsang Tanzin, Regional Manager, Mid Market at LinkedIn, women should be evaluating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leadership opportunities around three pillars:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purpose, potential, and people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ask yourself, does this opportunity truly move me? Does it align with the values and goals I’ve set for myself? Will I be working with people who will help me grow? And the reason you want to do that is because the transition to leadership can be challenging, but leaders who have a sense of purpose – and who understand how this role reflects that purpose – are more likely to thrive and inspire others around them,” she said.</span></p>
<p>For more (and to celebrate International Women&#8217;s Day), we <span style="font-weight: 400;">asked five female tech leaders for advice on how women should pursue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leadership roles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s what they had to say: </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology space needs more female leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent </span><a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/03/women-in-technology-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that women account for less than 20 percent of technology jobs in the US – a shockingly low percentage considering females make up more than 50 percent of the total workforce. The solution, however, isn’t as simple as just hiring more women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve rounded up five incredible female tech leaders who are championing diversity and using their voices to tackle the gender gap from within the industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kirsten Green</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_8449" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8449" class="wp-image-8449" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures.png" alt="female leaders" width="279" height="279" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures.png 800w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures-150x150.png 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures-300x300.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures-768x768.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures-109x109.png 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ForerunnerVentures-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8449" class="wp-caption-text">source: Forerunner Ventures</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Venture Capital world is extremely male-dominated, in fact, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/19/the-first-comprehensive-study-on-women-in-venture-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 7 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of leadership across VC’s is female. Kirsten Green, Founder and Managing Partner of Forerunner Ventures, is one of the ambitious women who make up the 7 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Forerunner’s investments focus on finding the right entrepreneur rather than the right gender, 40 percent of the </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/29/investing/kirsten-green-venture-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company’s portfolio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is made up of female-led companies – quite an impressive portion when women only own </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/06/27/gender-equality-a-trend-the-tech-sector-needs-to-get-behind/#62dfaf93717b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of technology startups. Some of Forerunner’s investments into female-founded companies include Glossier, Birchbox, Away, and Birdies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to have more women founders stepping up to kind of own their story and ask for what they want, and tell success stories and start really building confidence that these stories are out there,” Green </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/29/investing/kirsten-green-venture-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Green practicing diversity within her own firm, she is one of the founding members of </span><a href="https://www.allraise.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of female venture capitalists trying to eliminate the gender imbalances in the industry and foster success for women.</span></p>
<h2>Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_8452" style="width: 288px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8452" class="wp-image-8452 " src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joresablount_files_2018_05_IMG_7098-1200x1054.jpg" alt="female leaders" width="278" height="244" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joresablount_files_2018_05_IMG_7098-1200x1054.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joresablount_files_2018_05_IMG_7098-1200x1054-300x263.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/https___blogs-images.forbes.com_joresablount_files_2018_05_IMG_7098-1200x1054-768x674.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8452" class="wp-caption-text">source: Forbes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another powerful woman changing the VC space from the inside is Mandela Schumacher-Hodge Dixon, an experienced entrepreneur and the Founder and CEO of Founder Gym. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dixon has worked on both sides of the VC world; as an entrepreneur and as the Founding Portfolio Services Director at Kapor Capital, a California-based VC firm. Through these experiences Dixon began to recognize the stark demographic divide between the groups receiving the majority of funding and those who were not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do people do? They invest in people they know. If they continue to invest in people they know and that look like them, then you will never get to see other representations,” Dixon explained </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joresablount/2018/05/19/founder-gym-opens-the-door-to-silicon-valley-for-underrepresented-founders/#7ccb69f71762" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Forbes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with this knowledge, Dixon started Founder Gym, an online training program with the goal of helping underrepresented founders raise capital to scale their tech startups. Founder Gym’s first cohort started just last year, in which they trained 170 underrepresented founders, these groups includes females, people of colour, and Latinx men and women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Founder Gym is my attempt at closing gaps of knowledge, network, and capital for underrepresented founders so that they can participate in the innovation and wealth-creation movement that is the tech startup industry,” </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joresablount/2018/05/19/founder-gym-opens-the-door-to-silicon-valley-for-underrepresented-founders/#7ccb69f71762" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dixon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>Debbie Sterling</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_8453" style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8453" class="wp-image-8453 " src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/forbes.jpg" alt="female leaders" width="365" height="219" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/forbes.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/forbes-300x180.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/forbes-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8453" class="wp-caption-text">source: Forbes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Founder and CEO of GoldieBlox, 36-year-old engineer Debbie Sterling has created a multimedia enterprise focused on educating young girls and getting them interested in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driven by the realization that children’s toys involving engineering and science are heavily targeted at boys (think: lego and transformers), Sterling set out to create educational, narrative-based construction toys that would inspire young females to take an interest in STEM topics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Construction toys do really help develop spatial skills and are a good precursor for engineering, but they have been heavily marketed toward boys for over 100 years,&#8221; Sterling told </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/goldieblox-ceo-debbie-sterling-2016-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Insider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie Sterling is smashing stereotypes and striving for better gender balance in the STEM sector, and GoldieBlox is focused on making an impact where it matters: with our youth.</span></p>
<h2>Kathryn Finney</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_8455" style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8455" class="wp-image-8455 " src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot.jpg" alt="Female tech leader" width="301" height="301" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot.jpg 800w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kathryn-Finney-Headshot-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8455" class="wp-caption-text">source: Forbes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of America’s Top 50 Women in Tech last year, winner of the White House Champion of Change Award, and a former member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship; Kathryn Finney is no stranger to hard work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a woman of colour working in technology, she’s no stranger to adversity either. In an </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominiquefluker/2019/01/16/kathryn-finney/#2674a3131ab6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Finney shed some light on her experience as “one of three women” attending a tech incubator in New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I was the only person of color, I had to really push in order to be seen and acknowledged in the room,” said Finney. “And when I finally got to pitch, a male investor told me that my idea was good but that he ‘doesn’t do black women stuff’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that, unfortunately, her experience was not unique among women (especially among women of colour), Kathryn Finney founded Digital Undivided, an organization working to foster diversity in tech by helping Black and Latinx female founders build their startups and raise funds. So far, Digital Undivided has helped women entrepreneurs raise over $25 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here at Digital Undivided, we’re building a world where women own their work and economic security through entrepreneurship and innovation,” Finney told Forbes.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kirstine Stewart</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_8456" style="width: 381px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8456" class="wp-image-8456 " src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kirstine-stewartjpg.jpg" alt="female leader" width="371" height="247" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kirstine-stewartjpg.jpg 1200w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kirstine-stewartjpg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kirstine-stewartjpg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kirstine-stewartjpg-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kirstine-stewartjpg-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8456" class="wp-caption-text">source: Toronto Star</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirstine Stewart has already had a tremendous career, but she’s just getting started. Recently starting a new role as the Head of Shaping the Future of Media at World Economic Forum, Kirstine brought ample media and tech experience from her previous roles as CRO of Tribalscale and VP of Media at Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirstine is a spokeswoman for equality in the workplace, and has publicly shared her experiences as a female leader in her book,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our Turn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which she delves into the many things that must change in order to level the playing field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to get to the point where the people who make the decisions, those who you’re leaning in to, either look like you, sound like you, or is someone who can put themselves in the shoes of someone else and recognize that value in return,” said Stewart </span><a href="https://www.macleans.ca/society/kirstine-stewart-on-the-limits-of-leaning-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Maclean’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October, Kirstine Stewart spoke at FemaleForce, an event held by Salesforce to celebrate female business owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think women are at the leading forefront of understanding how to take advantage of those opportunities,” </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/10/19/the-time-is-right-femaleforce-brings-together-canadas-leading-entrepreneurial-spirits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Stewart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Women are stepping in because they can.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global survey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by equity data and insight group Equileap recently named General Motors the world’s best company when it comes to gender equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be surprising, but it shouldn’t be; according to GM’s 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity and Inclusion Report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women comprise 45 percent of GM’s Board of Directors, and the company has a long legacy of inclusion. In fact, GM established the first women’s dealer program and hired the first woman CEO and Chairman in the auto industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“General Motors is focused on building a winning culture – one that provides opportunity and an environment that allows each employee to reach his or her highest potential,” Ken Barrett, Global Chief Diversity Officer of General Motors, told us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that we win together as one team and share the responsibility of helping GM shape the future of mobility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While GM has raced to the front of the pack, there are many companies focusing on gender balance and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing workplace diversity. Here are some reasons why it’s become so important (and how companies can improve it). </span></p>
<h3><b>Your Company Will Make More Money </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At pharmaceutical company Merck – which was the fourth-best company worldwide in gender balance according to Equileap’s findings – diversity, inclusion, and balance are core parts of the organization’s mandate. That focus has paid dividends in a number of important ways.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8435" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8435" class="wp-image-8435 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Celeste-Warren-300x300.jpeg" alt="Celeste Warren, Merck" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Celeste-Warren-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Celeste-Warren-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Celeste-Warren-109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Celeste-Warren-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Celeste-Warren.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8435" class="wp-caption-text">Celeste Warren, Merck</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The world is full of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. At Merck, we recognize that in order to have the greatest impact, we need to champion a workforce that reflects the people we serve,” Celeste Warren, Vice President of Human Resources &amp; Global Diversity and Inclusion Center of Excellence at Merck, told us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a top priority for us and we see the benefits of diversity and inclusion every day in a number of ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you have a variety of voices and styles at the table, you experience increased innovation, improved productivity, better decisions, and business results; not to mention a much more engaged and happier workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s plenty of evidence of the effect gender balance has on the financial fortunes and efficiency of an organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An often-cited </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Credit Suisse Research Institute found that companies with women Directors outperformed those without in average growth, price/book-value multiples, and return on equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another global </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that in the companies in the top 20 percent of financial performances, 27 percent of their leaders were women, while the bottom 20 percent employed only had 19 percent of leadership roles occupied by women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, an internal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Sodexo found that their more gender-balanced units had greater client retention rates and customer satisfaction. Further, units with gender-balanced management were 13 percent more likely to deliver consistent organic growth and 23 percent more likely to show an increase in gross profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following those findings, the company formally targeted achieving gender-balanced management teams in all its business units by 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, we found that our teams with gender-balanced management achieve operational, organizational and performance benefits that include employee engagement, enhanced brand image, greater client and customer satisfaction, increased organic growth, and an increase in generating profit and cash,” CEO Michel Landel wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The case can’t be clearer – gender balance in business can’t be labeled purely a women’s issue or a matter of diversity for diversity’s sake. It’s an economic issue, and addressing it can benefit business and economic performance, thereby impacting all stakeholders.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Promoting Gender Balance Will Help the Economy as a Whole</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that $12 trillion can be added to global growth by advancing gender equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, there’s a significant risk if companies don’t get up to speed. Christine Lagarde, Managing Director and Chairwoman of the International Monetary Fund, recently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cautioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the world is in danger of establishing a “mediocre normal” of slower growth as populations age and economic disparities increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her suggestion? Take a closer look at female economic exclusion and find ways to boost women’s economic empowerment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will need all the economic growth, dynamism, and ingenuity we can get in the years ahead,” she said. “Thankfully, a key part of the solution is staring us right in the face: unleashing the economic power of women (and) bringing the world’s largest excluded group into the fold.” </span></p>
<h3><b>Your Company Will be a Happier Place to Work</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Warren mentioned, employees generally prefer to work in a balanced workplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Pew Research </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> painted a clear picture of the effect on morale with an imbalanced workplace. Only 13 percent of women who work mainly with other women say their gender has held them back at work, compared to 34 percent of those who work mainly with men. In a more balanced environment, 19 percent say their gender made it harder to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, 70 percent of women who work in balanced workplaces say women are usually treated fairly in recruitment/hiring (compared to 48 percent among women at majority male workplaces). Certainly, these imbalances don’t go unnoticed; 78 percent of women at balanced workplaces said their employer pays the right amount of attention to increasing gender diversity, compared to 49 percent at male-heavy workplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other serious risks associated with this kind of inequality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pew study found that 49 percent of women whose workplaces are mostly male say sexual harassment is a problem, compared to only 32 percent of women who work in mostly female workplaces. Women at imbalanced workplaces were also much more likely to report gender-based disparities in pay, treatment, and support than those working in balanced environments.</span></p>
<h3><b>It’s the Right Thing to do</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, many companies feel they have a moral imperative to balance out the genders of their workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At our core, we believe that having a diverse workforce – including all dimensions of diversity – is fundamental to our success,” Warren of Merck said. “By breaking down barriers, changing mindsets and deepening perspectives, we are inspiring the next great idea or invention that can lead to better health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When there is gender balance, everyone wins.”</span></p>
<h3><b>How Employers Can Improve Gender Balance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re now convinced of the benefits of diversifying your company, it’s time to look at the best methods to help you get there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do is to take a close look at your culture – and change it. That is harder than it sounds. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from Harvard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that people are not aware of the extent that their ingrained biases have supported inaccurate ideas about women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized that if you want to make a difference in your organization, first and foremost, you have to go through all the ‘plumbing’ – your systems and procedures, the way you recruit, the way you promote people – and take steps to rid the system of bias,” </span><a href="http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Connect/Rotman-MAG/Back-Issues/2018/Back-Issues---2018/Spring2018-ValueCreation/Spring2018-FreeFeatureArticle-KaplanLoboNesbitt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Richard Nesbitt, CEO of the Global Risk Institute for Financial Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have to understand that systemic bias is pervasive, and we have to take proactive steps to fight it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next come the more tangible steps: recruiting more women into senior leadership positions, establishing firm non-discrimination policies, and introducing sponsorship/mentorship programs (although, again, it’s crucial here to be aware of possible biases; a Harvard Business Review </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that women tend to get more mentoring but less sponsorship than their male coworkers).</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_8437" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8437" class="wp-image-8437 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GMMaryBarra-199x300.jpg" alt="Mary Barra, GM " width="199" height="300" /><p id="caption-attachment-8437" class="wp-caption-text">Mary Barra, GM</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has shown that rigid hours is a key issue for women – who still widely juggle disproportionately large roles in family caregiving – employers should look to offer more flexibility in hours and even on-site child care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, of course, the gender pay gap needs to be addressed. The World Economic Forum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it may take 118 years to close that gap, and it’s not hard to imagine the massive toll that would take on the world’s economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it’s important to ensure this balance is sustainable. It’s not enough to simply go on a hiring spree of women then sit back and consider your job done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, General Motors offers lessons on how to maintain an inclusive and diverse workforce well into the future. Some of the company policies and programs helping to further that goal include GM’s more than 20 women’s councils around the world, its Executive Leadership Program focusing on women, and the Take 2 internship program that targets applicants (both women and men) with technical backgrounds who have taken career breaks for more than two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Diversity is all about the pipeline. And it’s not just about gender, but about all forms of diversity,” Mary Barra, Chairwoman and CEO of General Motors Company, told BrainStation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At GM, for example, when we search for executive candidates, we require a diverse slate. If we find that a position has no diverse candidate, I ask the question, ‘What are we doing so that three years from now there will be a diverse candidate to consider?’”</span></p>
