								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Marie-France Cardin, the Founder of The Winning Partnership and a BrainStation professional development student. After 35 years of experience working for global organizations like PwC and KPMG, Marie-France is taking on her first major entrepreneurial endeavor. Looking to advance her skillset and better prepare for a competitive digital landscape, Marie-France decided to pursue digital skills training, and has recently completed her fourth Certificate Course at BrainStation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class=" wp-image-9364 alignleft" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MF_photo-1.jpg" alt="Entrepreneur" width="221" height="332" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MF_photo-1.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MF_photo-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px" />We chatted with Marie-France about her experience at BrainStation, why she decided to invest in her education, and how she’s using her newly developed skills.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a bit about your career and education background prior to BrainStation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many years ago I studied Public Relations at McGill University in Montréal, and then went on to do a certificate in Broadcast Journalism. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work with some large organizations – Molson Breweries of Canada, the Montréal Chamber of Commerce, Steinberg/Ivanhoe Cambridge, PwC, the Montréal Exchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 18 years my career has been dedicated to partnering with professionals at KPMG as the National Director, Pursuits and Proposals, to win new business as part of a targeted pursuit effort. After my first five years in Montréal as a bid manager, I moved to Toronto to deploy sales enablement support. I led a team of 35 people operating from Canada and India. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with the practitioners and sales and marketing resources, we submitted proposals to both private and publicly-held organizations and government. I had to focus on ensuring that the end-to-end pursuit process was scalable and agile in order to meet the needs of clients, procurement, and technology. </span></p>

</div>

</div>
<p><b>You’re in the midst of starting your own business, can you tell us about it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My new venture is called The Winning Partnership, and with it I’m embracing the opportunity to join forces with emerging industries, professional services, and not-for-profits to frame and deliver solutions that speak to the needs of their clients. Using agile, iterative principles we will work to co-design imaginative and original approaches to help compete, grow and succeed in fierce environments through sales enablement expertise.</span></p>
<p><b>In your opinion, what is the value of developing your technical skills before diving into an entrepreneurial endeavour?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients are very sophisticated and well informed, and as an entrepreneur in client services you have to solve for a problem. So if you want to be in a true partnership with your clients and collaborate efficiently with your associates, you need to have the technical skills to back up your claims. No one can excel at everything or work solo, but I think it’s crucial to surround yourself with the right people and skill sets to be able to handle diverse challenges. </span></p>
<p><b>You recently completed your fourth course at BrainStation, what has been your motivation behind taking each of these courses?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been speaking the same lingo for the past 18 years, and I needed to look at things from a different – and fresh – perspective. I enjoy taking courses, but I am not an academic and prefer instructor-led training to learning something on my own. So the idea of frequenting a technology school in my neighborhood that has campuses across North America was quite appealing. Also, being surrounded by intelligent, technologically capable individuals is quite fun and really helps push your boundaries.</span></p>
<p><b>Do you feel like the courses have complemented each other? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve taken Design Thinking, Agile, Digital Marketing, and Data Analytics. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/agile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were definitely complementary as they both deal with the process of building digital products and developing processes for solving business problems. I have no doubt that these two courses will be very helpful as I partner with clients in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/digital-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Analytics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that I could develop a better understanding of the two subjects. In today’s world, I need to be in a position to discuss and integrate with my clients when necessary, and want to make sure that my skills and knowledge are up to speed. </span></p>
<p><b>What are the most valuable lessons you have learned in your BrainStation courses?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look for the problem to solve, keep on being curious, don’t be afraid to ask questions, and collaboration is the key to success. Be sure to push your boundaries outside of your comfort zone. </span></p>
<p><b>How are you using the skills you’ve learned to further your business?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to completing four BrainStation courses this year, I’ve invested my time learning more about the Cannabis Industry. For our final project in the Data Analytics class, my workgroup volunteered to look at data on recreational consumption. The outcome of our analysis was to determine the number of cannabis retail outlets required to satisfy demand in Toronto and eliminate the black market. Now, my plan isn’t to open a retail cannabis store, but the analysis we completed shows that there is definitely room for the Ontario government to grant more licences – over 100 of them in Toronto alone – to meet the demand.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you describe the learning experience at BrainStation? What has been your favourite part?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the first time I walked into BrainStation to enquire about Design Thinking, I&#8217;ve loved every minute. The ambiance is conducive to learning in an agile, collaborative manner and I cannot praise the experience, expertise and knowledge of the instructors enough. I appreciated that the instructors bring a consultant approach to the curriculum and aren&#8217;t tied to one specific organization. Their wide industry experience and network are a big plus in the learning environment, and I’ve been very impressed with their ability to adjust to the students in class and tailor their instruction when needed to meet the needs of the broader group.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it’s common to hear companies describe themselves or their processes as “Agile,” especially those working in the technology landscape. But what does Agile really mean, and why is it so popular?</span></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-8208" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FullSizeRender-767x1024.jpg" alt="Vice President of Technology" width="235" height="314" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FullSizeRender-767x1024.jpg 767w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FullSizeRender-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke with Peter Daly, a seasoned Vice President of Software Engineering and Technology, to help explain Agile methodology; what Agile is, how to implement it properly, and what that looks like on an organizational level. Peter has worked as a VP for more than 20 years for a wide range of companies, including BCE (Bell Canada Enterprises), Saville Systems, TELUS Health, and Achievers.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What is Agile?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile, at its core, is a set of principles and values that help break down complex projects into short, digestible pieces that increase the probability for success. Based on a </span><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple manifesto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 12 core principles, Agile has become the modern standard for software development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply: “Agile is a concept created to improve the process of software development, and to help large, complex projects be successful,” says Daly.  “It’s based on a number of ideas, but the basic principles are to focus on the capabilities of the team and not let them be encumbered by heavy processes, slow decision-making, or poor communication.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>How it All Started</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodologies came about in the 1990s when a great portion of software development resulted in failure in some capacity; whether it was going over budget, not finishing on time, or being canceled altogether. In fact, The Standish Group’s </span><a href="https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/white-papers/chaos-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaos Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1995 revealed that 31.1 percent of software development projects were canceled before they were completed, and 53.7 percent cost 189 percent of their original forecast. It was also apparent that the project failure in larger organizations was significantly worse than that in small- or medium-sized companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The major contributing factors as to why such a large number of software development projects failed included obstacles like unrealistic deadlines and budgets, poor communication across teams and with senior management, project progress being impacted by change, and competing priorities,” Daly explains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by 17 leading minds in technology and development, the Agile Manifesto was born in 2001 with the purpose of improving software development and shifting the focus from following a plan at all costs, towards adapting to change to deliver high-quality software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, organizations have been attempting to implement Agile principles and methodologies to improve their practices and ultimately reap the benefits. In fact, many organizations have started implementing Agile methodologies into all aspects of their processes – not just software development. This presents an entirely new set of challenges, but if practiced correctly, Agile can be the key to delivering quality projects on time, and within budget.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Benefits of Agile</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify, Microsoft, IBM are a few of the industry-leading companies known to use an Agile approach. They are not alone. Over </span><a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of organizations use Agile in some way, which means if you don’t practice Agile, you’re an outlier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why has Agile become the standard across industries? First of all, it’s proven to increase the probability of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Agile and its frameworks, such as Scrum, are applied in a disciplined manner by teams with the necessary skills and experience, it will increase the probability of a successful project,” says Daly. “It’s a proven, lightweight, and easy to understand framework which is why businesses like to employ it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/actuarial-insurance-services/assets/agile-project-delivery-confidence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from PwC found that projects using Agile methodologies are 28 percent more successful than those that don’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Agile enables organizations to create higher quality projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The concept of inspection, which is a pillar of Scrum, allows quality to be built into the approach,” says Daly. “And when you can achieve high-quality levels, you’re going to lower your costs, and you’re going to improve the probability of delivering a successful project.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_8210" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8210" class=" wp-image-8210" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/download-1.jpg" alt="Scrum Values" width="198" height="147" /><p id="caption-attachment-8210" class="wp-caption-text">Source: guntherverheyen.com</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile can also create a positive work environment by focusing on values. Scrum, an Agile framework, focuses on five core values that can improve the work environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Key factors that make the entire concept of Agile successful are the Scrum values: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect,” Daly explains. “These values align with the most common things people look for in a workplace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People enjoy working this way, and they take more ownership of the outcomes. They’re working in smaller teams that are more effective from a communications point of view.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>Measuring Success</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The positive impact of Agile on employees and entire teams is one of the key ways to measure its success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An important indicator is the morale of your development teams. It’s typically higher when you’re using agile frameworks effectively,” says Daly. “The values of Agile and Scrum are values that developers look for. Teamwork is much stronger when those values are being met.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the easiest way to determine if you are implementing Agile methodologies correctly is to look at the project outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another indicator of success is that you are producing high-quality software,” explains Daly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If agile is working, that means you’re able to continuously deliver either new products or improvements to your products, in a short period of time.”</span></p>
