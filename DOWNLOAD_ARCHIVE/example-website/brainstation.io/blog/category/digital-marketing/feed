<p><strong>How Digital Marketing Built These Brands</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on November 19 and featured leaders from <strong>Wave</strong>,<strong> Updater</strong>, and<strong> Better.com</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re working on a new business or an established brand, digital marketing is now more essential than ever for continued growth. If you’re able to harness its powers and capabilities, you’ll be able to have long term gain over short term glamour.</p>



<p>We spoke with marketing experts from <strong>Wave</strong>, <strong>Updater</strong>, and <strong>Better.com</strong> to share their tips for identifying customers and growing your business, using the power of digital marketing and the plethora of digital strategies now available.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Leverage Free or Low Cost Tools</h2>



<p>Knowing where to invest your resources is a crucial step in your company’s growth, especially for new brands and entrepreneurs. One unanimous piece of advice for entrepreneurs from our panelists is to explore your options when it comes to identifying and defining your marketing and competitors.</p>



<p>Melanie Dodge, Director of Marketing at Better.com, recommends using low-cost tools to understand the search behaviors of your customers and the interests and needs of your leads.</p>



<p>“Your customers are your best tools. They will tell you what they&#8217;re thinking and that can also inform strategy,” says Dodge, adding that conducting surveys and tracking the search patterns of your customers and competitors are great places to start.</p>



<p>Being aware of your competitors is essential, particularly when it comes to something like developing bidding strategies –&nbsp;they may have access to significantly larger budgets. Jenna Weinerman, VP of Marketing at Updater offers a cost-effective tip.</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re marketing, you don&#8217;t have to bid or advertise. You can create content to answer the questions of what they&#8217;re searching for,” Weinerman says. “Say something relevant and powerful,” as a creative solution for smart search spending on a small budget.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Invest In SEO (and be Patient)</h2>



<p>The ability to put the right content in front of the right eyes at the right time is what makes Search Engine Optimization (SEO) a go-to tool for digital marketers.</p>



<p>“SEO is something that we&#8217;ve really doubled down on and I&#8217;m a really big believer in not just ranking for the traffic, but actually adding something of value,” says Dodge.</p>



<p>Sarah Bugeja, Director of Demand Generation at Wave, agrees, explaining that SEO needs to complement your content strategy. “It is incredibly important from an organic point of view to build meaningful content that serves the needs of what people are looking for and anchoring it also with brand friendly content.”</p>



<p>Bugeja also notes that in order to see success with SEO, get comfortable with playing the long game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not something you do today and you&#8217;re going to see amazing results tomorrow. There is some patience to be had, especially depending on the vertical that you&#8217;re playing in&#8230;and it may take you longer to index, meaning to show up higher [in organic search results],” says Bugeja.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Use Content to Build Your Brand</h2>



<p>In our previous Digital Leadership Event Series panel, <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/the-new-rules-of-marketing-creating-stand-out-content">The New Rules of Marketing: Creating Stand-Out Content</a>, maximizing your content was a key takeaway. When you have limited access to tools or tricks for new content creation, investing in larger pieces with dynamic content that can be divided and delivered across several platforms is a smart use of resources, rather than speeding through several, smaller, specific pieces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Spend the extra time to actually add value and go past getting the traffic there. So whether it&#8217;s putting a visual in an animation and video, recycle and make your content work for you. Don&#8217;t do double the job,” says Dodge, recommending&nbsp; a more scientific approach to measurement, not only for top of funnel metrics, but when looking at the trickle down effect of your marketing initiatives.</p>



<p>“Maybe a [Call to Action] or an ad is driving a lot of clicks and orders, but is it ultimately driving to that conversion goal?”</p>



<p>Informed consumers look for quality content to build their long term brand loyalty, but advocating for it while balancing quarterly targets can be a challenge when speaking with different stakeholders and connecting content strategy to the overall organizational goals.</p>



<p>“You need proof points,” says Weinerman. Qualitative measurements such as surveys, customer comments, public relations, and articles are strong points to build an arsenal that can pay off in the long run in building brand credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re in it for the quick win in B2B, it&#8217;s really easy to be forgotten. So I tend to put more emphasis on the brand because I want to build a really memorable brand experience for our clients rather than one conversion at a time, because they&#8217;re not going to be with us for that one conversion. That&#8217;s the beginning of their journey with us,” says Weinerman.</p>



<p>Long-term relationship building requires showing your customers consistent value and adding features that can make their lives easier throughout their life cycle with your organization. In order to maximize your efforts, collaborating with people from different teams can align company goals, and generate multi-platform solutions.</p>



<h2>Leverage Cross-Functional Teams </h2>



<p>Working with other departments allows for more actionable, informed insights. Cohesive, cross-functional teams with key players is one way marketers are leveraging internal skill sets to turn key learnings into meaningful performance.</p>



<p>Dodge says that a critical investment Better.com made was hiring a director of Product of Growth and establishing a growth committee made up of their product, marketing, design, and data teams. “Through that we have really established a test-and-learn approach to everything we do when it comes to digital marketing.”</p>



<p>Bugeja credits working with her data team as a key asset to Wave’s marketing strategy. “Working with our data science team to understand campaign performance has really improved our ability to execute on paid search super efficiently when we understand what is actually driving the best kinds of acquisition,” she says, adding that one final piece of advice for new businesses and entrepreneurs, “don’t be afraid of the word pivot.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, our experts strive to blend strategies, tools, and teams that will work together to convert outstanding, long-lasting customers. By integrating the measurable and meaningful content, businesses will often see cost-effective, sustained performance growth.<br></p>

<p><strong>New Rules of Influencer Marketing</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on October 22nd, and featured four influencers and influencer marketing experts from Levitate Style, Pinterest, Edelman and SAP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/471189262" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>Influencer marketing – when brands engage personalities with large social-media followings to spread the word about their products and services – was already booming when the pandemic hit this past spring. But while many influencers saw shelter-in-place as an opportunity for growth – 21 percent of American consumers reportedly bought something at an influencer’s recommendation for the first time between March and August of this year – it has also forced influencer marketing to adapt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We spoke with executives from Pinterest, Edelman and SAP, as well as Levitate Style influencer Leo Chan about the surprising benefits of influencer marketing, where the field is heading, and tips to make it work, whether you’re an influencer or a brand looking to collaborate with one.</p>



<h2><strong>Authenticity is Key</strong> in Influencer Marketing</h2>



<p>The growth of influencer marketing is a direct response to audiences’ increasing savviness – largely a result of influencers’ authentic voices. As Rachel Miller, Global Influencer Marketing Lead at SAP, explains, “The power of influencer marketing, particularly for B2B, is the storytelling. It’s a long sales cycle, so your audience gets to know this person, they trust them, and you build rapport. You’re not just bringing in a new face constantly; you have that trusted individual – or individuals – which really resonate with your target audience. Influencers provide necessary third-party validation, that peer recommendation, and they often tell your story better than you can.”</p>



<p>There’s often a seamlessness between influencers’ organic and paid content – this is what gives sponsored content its impact. There are two important considerations here: consistently high quality, and transparency about what’s sponsored and what’s not. New FTC guidelines stipulate disclosure requirements, but this may actually be to influencers’ benefit, as it helps boost their legitimacy. As Leo Chan, Influencer Content Creator and Founder at Levitate Style, describes it, “You have to include #ad and #sponsor, but as an influencer, it doesn’t really make that big of a difference. It still comes down to content. If you have good content, it doesn’t matter if it’s an ad, because it should fit with the quality of your posts. It should fit in seamlessly with the rest of your work. It’s actually better to clarify, for the followers and for brands as well.”</p>



<p>Authenticity shapes not only the way content is presented, but increasingly, its subject matter as well. “For influencer content,” says Larry Beaman, VP of Influencer Marketing at Edelman, “we’re seeing more and more influencers pushing back and saying, ‘These filters are kind of insane, and I don’t look anything like this.’ Now, a lot of content is moving to stories, no makeup, and showing true life. We’re seeing a shift more and more to showing behind-the-scenes, true life without those filtered options layered on top.”</p>



<p>Alexandra Nikolajev, Global Creator Inclusion Lead at Pinterest, agrees: “It means greater shifting not only in the content that influencers share – curated content versus more in-the-moment or real-life content – but also in the conversations that they’re willing to have. It’s no longer just ‘Where did you get that top from?’ It’s shifted now to ‘This is a sustainable item. This is the social impact that the brand has.’ That social-impact piece of the conversation, and the way influencers are having deeper conversations online, is resulting in stronger community-building, and ultimately deeper engagement with their audience.”</p>



<h2><strong>Barrier to Entry is Low, ROI is High</strong></h2>



<p>“Budget should not be a barrier to jumping into influencer marketing,” Miller says. “While I have access to the latest and greatest tools for influencer identification and engagement, I frequently just use native Twitter or Instagram to search hashtags to find new voices. That’s free – anybody can do that.”</p>



<p>Depending on the type of product or service a business provides, there may also be non-monetary ways to compensate an influencer working on their behalf. “While transactions should be mutually beneficial, they don’t have to be monetary,” Miller continues. “There’s a lot of win–wins for certain individuals; it could be networking, content, syndication, access to sneak previews. A lot of ways you can get creative.”</p>



<p>Chan echoes her sentiments. “I work with brands purely because I’m a huge fan of the brand and because I have a good relationship with the marketing person – I’m happy to help them out. Different times of the year, there’s different pushes. It’s good to build that relationship. And that brand could also help an influencer, help feature me to bring me to their audience as well. It’s good cross-promotion.”</p>



<p>As Beaman points out, “Microinfluencers have the highest engagement rates. Typically, they have the lowest cost threshold. So it’s a great place to test at a low dollar-value. And usually, if you’re a niche product, that might be the right choice anyway, because microinfluencers have a more specific connection to your brand. And if your business is one that makes sense for affiliate codes, if you’re a direct-to-consumer brand that’s selling products online, they may be open to working with you on a conversion basis instead of a flat-rate basis.”</p>



<p>While influencer marketing can provide an excellent return on investment, measuring that ROI can be a challenge, especially for B2B, where purchases may play out over months or even years – though there are now more sophisticated ways to achieve this. “Metrics vary greatly depending on the goal of the campaign,” Miller says. “Sometimes, it’s brand awareness. You may be looking at reach or driving registrations to a webinar, but you need to know what success looks like, and that should be something that you build in up front.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasingly, this means bringing data science into the realm of influencer marketing. Beamen explains, “The things we most frequently look at these days are ad recall, brand awareness, consideration of the product, or a company actually lifting in sales. And even more commonly right now, brands are curious if they’re relevant to the consumers they’re going after, and if consumers trust them at all. It’s not just about pushing products anymore. Some of this is done through survey questions to influencer audiences, to see if they’re remembering what we put through their feeds from an organic standpoint and a paid standpoint, and seeing how we’re shifting their perceptions over time. It’s pulling together a lot of what was available in performance marketing and paid social marketing, and bringing that into the influencer space.”</p>



<h2><strong>Influencer Marketing is a Marathon</strong></h2>



<p>“As an influencer, one of the biggest misconceptions is that it’s easy to achieve success quickly, or that one viral piece of content translates into long-term success,” says Nikolajev. “We need to recognize that this is a real industry. This is real work. And influencers, big or small, are really dedicating their time and energy to creating content.”</p>



<p>Chan concurs: it takes time. “Outsiders looking in think it’s so simple – you just take a photo, post it on Instagram. But it’s really not just that. If you’re a content creator, you’re constantly getting better at taking photos, taking videos. How can you find your voice? How do you build a platform? To build an audience – that’s really hard to do. It’s a real business. You need a whole marketing team, a whole PR team to create a successful campaign, because there’s so many moving parts. There are managers that manage contracts and negotiations and deliverables. And then you have the influencer who goes out and do the work and edit the content, and then – finally – we post. There’s all these amazing people behind the scenes to make the one photo happen.”</p>



<p>As Nikolajev explains, it can be difficult for an influencer to know how much to charge for their work. “Having candid conversations within your communities and your influencer network will help you to understand how you should be tiering your rates and what you’re looking for, and allow you to be open and honest and direct with a brand. You tend to devalue the impact and effect that you could have. You don’t want to be priced at something astronomical, or be insulting to a brand – but you need to understand the value that you bring. Be able to back it up with what you’ve done in the past, and show that you can have that impact as a content creator and feel confident in what you’re asking for.”</p>



<h2><strong>Just Go For It</strong></h2>



<p>Because the cost of investment is so low, it doesn’t make sense to hesitate. “Just go for it,” Beaman says. “People discuss and discuss, and think it’s too new and not ready. I’ve been doing this a long time, and my advice is to just jump in, because otherwise you’ll be behind instead of ahead.” Even if you’re not totally comfortable with social media – well, influencers are, and it’s their expertise you’re trying to leverage. “Brands get to benefit from influencers’ expertise and this technology that they don’t really have to participate in directly,” Beaman says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the great benefits of using social media for marketing is the abundance of different channels, each of them suited to a different type of content – each capable of reaching a different audience. “I understand people look at Tiktok and think, ‘Oh, it’s for teenagers, I’m too old, it’s not for me,’” Chan says. “That’s the kind of voice our parents or grandparents had about Facebook and Instagram. You don’t want to get left behind with social media and technology. With new platforms, I just try it out.”</p>



<p>Diversifying also means you’ll be more resilient to the changes that social media platforms make to their terms of service, to the evolving types of content different platforms favor, and even technology fails. “You should always be trying out different platforms like Tiktok and Snapchat and LinkedIn and Twitter,” Chan says, “so in case Instagram goes down for a day, you have other platforms to fall back on. You never want all your eggs in one basket – if anything happens, any big change, you’re ready to go.”<br></p>

<p><strong>Brick &amp; Mortar to Click &amp; Order: Retail Experience in 2021</strong> – the first instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series –&nbsp; took place on January 21 and featured leaders from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;">
<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/503248993?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">2020 was a year that transformed retail, forcing brands to reconsider and re-invest in the way they market and sell their products among increased online competition.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Many top brands are now offering faster shipping and one-click checkout for seamless UX, as well as AR/VR experiences that allow customers to “touch-and-feel” their preferred products. There has also been an increased focus on omni-channel selling, most notably on social media, with a record of $23.3 billion in social commerce sales expected by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">We spoke with digital marketing and product experts from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong> to share insights on how they’ve adapted their in-person and online shopping experiences for customers, and the trends and channels have been most successful in preparing for the future.<br></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Invest in Ideas Early</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the rapid pace of innovation over the course of the year, some brands had to play catch up to pivot their offerings to fit the digital landscape. Many of the brands that saw success during these uncertain times were ones that were already investing in digital channels and opportunities.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Jonathon Relkin, Director of Off-Premise at Chipotle, credited his team for being an early adopter of emerging tech, from third-party partnerships to Tik Tok. “We were laying the foundation prior to all of this happening,” he said. “We invested in a digital flow from what the customer sees to the back of house operations.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Relkin also saw a swift change in where their revenue was coming from, “20 percent of revenue was coming from digital before. In the height of Corona it went as high as 70 percent. Now we’re averaging at 50 percent and we’re able to lean into it because of the work and investments made to have digital success.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Daniella Bellaire, Head of Global Revenue Enablement and Shopify, noted that whenever changes appear, reducing barriers of adoption across the board is a good place to start.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Retailers are more adaptable than people thought,” she said. Shopify partnered with the Government of Canada to create a Go Digital Canada initiative to help entrepreneurs start up their businesses during this time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Make Data-Driven Decisions&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">For a Consumer Packaging Goods (CPG) company like General Mills, change can be slow as annual cycles have been used for decades. The company, however, has been able to navigate these tricky times by optimizing existing strategies and attempting to automate as many processes as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Our motto for our omnichannel is ‘to show up brilliantly’,” said Jay Picconatto, Director of Commerce at General Mills. “Our retailers wanted quality content across platforms. Most of our energy has been spent to show up brilliantly on all platforms.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The company has also focused on director-to-consumer (D2C) shopping, allowing them to gather and analyze relevant data on their customers, brand, and operational partners. With this information, they&#8217;ve been able to review the effectiveness of their digital strategy and optimize approaches, processes, and campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“E-commerce a year ago was less than five percent of our business. Now, it&#8217;s more than double that. We&#8217;ve had to really have a heavy lift on some of those process tools and capabilities, even just ways of working to make sure that we show up brilliantly on our retailers platforms.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Focus on Your Brand Story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Both Relkin and Bellaire agree that having consistent brand storytelling across your channels is important to a consumer to buy-into the ethos of your brand, to then buy your products. This means investing in your digital infrastructure and leveraging the resources available to you.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“We fundamentally believe we can change the world one burrito at a time,” said Relkin. “We look at our digital ecosystem and the channels that we show up on and really think about who&#8217;s there, why are they there, what are they interested in, and how do we engage in that conversation as a brand.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The reality is digital affords us an ability to do storytelling and probably a better way than than a traditional grocery store does,” said Picconatto. “It allows us to provide solutions in a way that we never could figure out in store. For example, we can even bundle things in different parts of the store online.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Picconatto points to an example how his digital team jumped on a Barbie cake trend that allowed them to sell dolls alongside their Betty Crocker cake mixes. “We could never pull that off in-store,” he said.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Integrate Digital and Analog Experiences</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the adoption of digital platforms and e-commerce, delivering a great user experience is now practically mandatory for success in today’s market. While retailers are looking to create and innovate their digital experiences, our panelists also remind brands to invest in their physical spaces as well, and to rethink how they could be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“User experience is really at the forefront of the digital experience and the online shopping experience. Making sure it’s easy to put things into a cart, and that it’s easy to check out,” said Bellaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Most of the growth online is still being fulfilled in store,” said Picconatto. “When you think about click and collect models for grocery performance, for example.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Stores are working with band-aids right now with having fulfillment warehouses bolted onto the buildings or just sitting in the front of the store. You need to think through the total product offering needed to make [the pick up experience] easier.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Convenience will prevail,” said Bellaire. “But if there’s a unique experience involved, I will show up and I will buy in-person because I want to support my community.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Ultimately, humans love tangible experiences and value convenience. With the retail changes that will continue to unfold, the potential for a new symbiotic relationship between in-store activities and digital conveniences to augment each other to a holistic consumer experience leaves lots of room for entrepreneurs and businesses to find their unique place in this evolving landscape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>New Rules of Marketing: Creating Stand-Out Content </strong>– the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on September 17th and featured executives from&nbsp; La Colombe Coffee, Chobani, Condé Nast, and Unbounce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/459177474" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>The average adult picks up their phone 58 times a day. That is 58 opportunities for brands to capture a user’s attention, build brand awareness, and convert a user. Today with increased competition and increasingly discerning consumers, it’s never been harder for brands to stand out. How do you create “thumb-stopping” content that breaks through the noise?</p>



<p>We spoke with content marketing experts from La Colombe Coffee, Chobani, Condé Nast, and Unbounce to see how they’ve adjusted to the COVID-era.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Let Data Lead the Way</h2>



<p>If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s the value of data, particularly when it comes to testing new mediums, channels, and forms of content.  </p>



<p>Lloyd D’Souza, the Executive Creative Director/Head of Content Development at Condé Nast, reveals that the company’s brand-building initiatives lean heavily on the work of its editorial teams, who often have already experimented with new and emerging platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We get the data from them and see what works&#8230;and apply that to how we work with the brand,” he said, giving the example of the audience Self Magazine has cultivated on TikTok.</p>



<p>“Self has essentially created a whole kind of brand voice on TikTok. Their approach to sexual education, and how they talk about it there, is incredible&#8230; and what they&#8217;ve done is applied an authentic voice&#8230;to give information to a Gen Z audience that&#8217;s looking for sexual health education,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They&#8217;ve created an audience that considers Self an authority on this, and&#8230;we&#8217;re looking to do that with all our brands.” </p>



<p>Data can also be leveraged to identify opportunities on the product development side. La Colombe Coffee, and its Draft Latte product line, is a good example.</p>



<p>“We launched oat milk into our cafes and within days saw such a huge shift; tons of people going towards putting oat milk into their coffees,” said Kathryn O’Connor, SVP, Marketing at&nbsp; La Colombe Coffee, explaining that  this user data encouraged the brand to start serving draft latte with oat milk at their retail outlets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using market intelligence, the brand realized that ready-to-drink coffee was one of the fastest growing segments in the beverage category. The company sense an opportunity for a canned oat milk draft latte and applied their data-driven approach to develop a strategy. </p>



<p>“We look at an overlay of the category development across the country, the brand development index across the country, where we&#8217;re seeing these early adopters of alt milks, where we&#8217;re seeing ready-to-drink pop on the radar and then layer that with where our distribution’s high, and where the media is available. We then use all of those pieces to help inform our go-to-market strategy and our marketing strategy,” O’Connor said. </p>



<h2>Adapt and Repurpose Content</h2>



<p>As consumers become more media savvy, and with more channels and mediums than ever, content marketing needs to now include a mix of content, which organizations should be ready to repurpose and adapt for different parts of the marketing funnel.</p>



<p>“Our content mix changes kind of annually based on business need so we choose quarterly objectives that our marketing is going to focus on, or the direction that we want to go, and then our content is derived from those objectives,” said Jennifer Pepper, the Director of Content Marketing at Unbounce, explaining that her team creates a matrix of content gaps.</p>



<p>“We take a look at our different profiles or audience members and ask, do we have a customer story here? What do we need at the top of the funnel? We take a look at that and where we need to create in certain areas versus maybe the most sexy things – you know like everybody wants a branded show, everybody wants a podcast – but really making sure you have that foundation set from the start is really important,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to O’Connor, La Colombe Coffee follows a similar approach, with a focus on creating a mix of paid and organic content that leans on taste appeal and aspirational imagery.  The key, she says, is being ready to adapt. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re constantly revisiting it&#8230;does it still sit? Does it still resonate? Has something happened that we need to react to – especially the past six seven months have shown us there&#8217;s a lot to react to – so we are always revisiting and it has to be flexible.”</p>



<h2>Balance Purpose With Product in Stories</h2>



<p>Over the last few years, there has been a lot of importance given to “purpose-driven marketing”&nbsp; – the idea that consumers want their brands to be aligned with a cause or purpose – partly because consumers today are more discerning than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for Eddie Revis, Vice President of Brand, Marketing and Media at Chobani, purpose-driven stories have to be measured out equally with good old-fashioned product marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have to balance both, because you&#8217;ll never have one without the other successfully,” he said, explaining that Chobani has worked hard to avoid a trap many direct-to-consumer brands fall into, where you “have no idea who the company is and you don&#8217;t know what they stand for and you don&#8217;t know what their story is and why they exist.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, Chobani recently announced it was donating all profits from a new limited-edition flavor (Chobani Greek yogurt PB&amp;J) to Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that provides food to people in need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s a product story we&#8217;re talking about with this great product – this healthy nutritious yogurt that you can go buy – but it&#8217;s driven by our purpose and who we are as a company,” Revis said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Embrace the Power of AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Marketing today isn’t only about building brands through amazing content. It is also closely measured by its impact on business growth. And to deliver high-converting content, more and more marketers are leveraging AI and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was a skeptic of this myself because I thought that sounds too futuristic,&#8221; Pepper said, &#8220;but where you used to be confined to testing this versus that, or a split test where you&#8217;re sending traffic to a landing page that&#8217;s basically equally weighted in all cases, we have now developed things like smart traffic, where instead of fiddling around with your ad platforms you can you can create tons of different variants of your campaign message to strike the right tone with different portions of your audience,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not about you making those decisions anymore – you can actually hand that over to machine learning, which I think is really exciting because it does feel futuristic but it&#8217;s basically this giant easy button.” </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>Evolution of the CMO Role with Vimeo’s Harris Beber</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> –&nbsp;took place on August 19th, and professionals around the world tuned in to hear Beber&#8217;s thoughts on the fast-changing marketing field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/449733902" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>A Chief Marketing Offices (CMO) is someone who oversees all marketing activities within an organization. In the last few years, the CMO role has started to evolve, with professionals needing to implement new digital strategies and processes, all while overseeing business growth and user experience.</p>



<p>We spoke to Beber to find out more about this evolution, his career trajectory, and what skills he thinks are most important for marketers, today and in the future.</p>



<h2>How Do You Become a CMO?</h2>



<p>Successful CMOs today need to be versatile, with a range of expertise and skills. To develop these skills, it’s often necessary to become students, in a way, of their business and industry. Beber has adopted this approach throughout his career and believes it is essential for anyone aspiring to become a CMO.</p>



<p>“Don’t be afraid to take a different path&#8230;I raised my hand for every cross-functional project. I wanted to understand how the business worked because…that made me better. It’s ok to take a step to the right, to take on a different challenge that deepens and expands your knowledge because that will make you a better marketer,” he says, adding that entrepreneurial and startup experience is invaluable in a similar way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you&#8217;re two people in a basement, you don&#8217;t have a team of resources across different functions; You are that team&#8230;and by wearing so many hats, you become an operator of a business and understand what drives the business forward, which has served me as a marketer,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How Has the CMO Role Evolved?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Traditionally, when people think about marketing, they imagine big, fun brand campaigns. Now more than ever, though, marketers are also being held responsible for revenue and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The blessing and the curse of marketing is everything you do is measurable. It&#8217;s very clear to see the impact of most things, and whether it&#8217;s working or not. And you&#8217;re held accountable for that,” Beber says.</p>



<p>“Delivering growth while also becoming profitable is no small feat, but what it instills is understanding what you need to do to succeed, what are your KPIs, and then how do you build promotions, tactics, and strategies that deliver?” he says, adding that adaptability, both individually and organizationally, is essential, as things can and will change quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our world is dynamic, it’s changing on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis&#8230;If you’re doing your job well, as soon as you have it figured out within a matter of weeks or months it’s not figured out anymore; the world shifts. Think about what Google Search was 10 years ago and now it’s table stakes and you’re really optimizing to even make it profitable because everyone’s there,” Beber says, explaining that brands can avoid common pitfalls by adopting a data-driven approach and always remembering their purpose and how they provide value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Executing on the fundamentals will give you your scale and your day-to-day, but where you can be ahead of the game, where you’re seeing trends and tapping into them, those can create opportunities for incremental growth that you’re not thinking about,” he says,&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Flawed CMO vs. CIO Debate</h2>



<p>Over the last few years, the lines between CMO and Chief Information Officer (CIO) roles have started to blur. While the latter is typically responsible for implementing digital solutions and processes on an organizational level, these are often directly related to marketing initiatives, which fall under the CMO’s purview. This has created a debate around who exactly should be &#8220;owning digital.&#8221;. According to Beber, though, the premise behind this debate is flawed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“if you answer that question, you&#8217;re doomed to fail because <em>everyone</em> has to own digital. The best companies that I’ve been in share accountability. At Vimeo, product has a responsibility for building products that serve a real value and deliver value. Marketing’s responsibility is to raise awareness, demonstrate that value to the target users, and drive adoption. It’s a one-two punch; it doesn’t work without both of us,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What Marketing Skills Are Most Important Now?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to break into digital marketing, there are a number of technical “hard” skills that you can develop to gain an advantage on the job market. But for Beber, the rapid pace of change in the digital space means that these are often less important than a strong work ethic, a solution-oriented mindset, and an ability to think outside the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People who know how to solve problems and think creatively about delivering solutions are the most valuable people on any team&#8230;It’s not about the function they were hired for, it&#8217;s the solutions that they can deliver for any challenge that we face as a business,” he says, explaining that these are the traits he looks for when hiring for his own team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to have really smart people with high aptitude that look at problems and say, ‘how am I going to solve this and come up with creative solutions to tackling the problems of the future.’ Those are the people that will always have growth and a career path.” <br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>How D2C Brands Are Defining The Future of Retail,</strong> the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on August 6th, and thousands tuned in to learn more about how some of the world’s leading D2C brands are defining the future of retail with new marketing, design, and data strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/446613160" width="640" height="361" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>Direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies have exploded over the past decade, setting new standards for user experience with innovative retail and marketing strategies. In the process, they’ve disrupted entire industries and forced traditional retailers to play catch-up.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at how some leading D2C brands started and how their approach to marketing is helping them grow.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Focusing on Personalization and Personal Connections </h3>



<p>Beekeeper’s Naturals is an innovative wellness company that develops nutraceutical products from plant-based ingredients. The company grew out of the personal experiences of Founder and CEO Carly Stein, and that has helped it differentiate itself from others natural and organic products in the health and wellness category.</p>



<p>“I started this company because I have chronic tonsillitis, coupled with an allergic reaction to basically every over-the-counter medication. I can’t take antibiotics … I was chronically ill, and I couldn&#8217;t find solutions in the natural aisle. I found there was a real disconnect between natural ingredients and efficacy plant-based formulas, and that’s what Beekeeper’s Naturals is all about,” said Stein.</p>



<p>The company’s initial marketing strategy involved seeking out others facing the same challenges and connecting with those struggling with similar medical obstacles. Stein and her team would attend conferences on Celiac’s Disease, find those with allergies and compromised immune systems, and engage with people in chat rooms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How that’s evolved over time is that we basically found these very early evangelists, found the demographic that needed the product that we had, connected with them and have found different ways to work with them,” she said, adding that many “early evangelists” now work with the company on Instagram and as affiliates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Rami Helali of Kotn, a fast-growing Canadian clothing retailer that sells ethically made products, followed a similar approach when first starting out. While Beekeeper’s Naturals targeted specific conferences, Kotn took to the press with a highly personalized approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the insights that I had early on was we needed others to tell our story, others with legitimacy&#8230;and for us, that was people in the press,” he said explaining that the company contacted a list of over two thousand editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wrote a personalized email to every single one of these editors&#8230;and, you know, I sent thousands of these and got probably like six responses. And out of those six responses, probably got two articles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s very much putting yourself in that uncomfortable position to get that first push, because often one of the hardest things to do is go from not-existing to existing&#8230;it requires doing things that don&#8217;t scale,” Helali said.</p>



<h3>Embracing Omnichannel Marketing</h3>



<p>Many leading D2C brands started digital first, but digital-first doesn’t mean digital-only &#8212; D2C&nbsp; brands often find value interacting with their customers in real life to create a cohesive omnichannel experience crucial. Helali emphasized the importance of understanding each of your channels and prioritizing what works for your brand.</p>



<p>“You may be doing 10 things, but find one or two things that really resonate with the customer,&#8221; he says, adding that it’s important to understand what each channel is supposed to do for your marketing stack and sticking to channels that work for your brand.</p>



<p>“I think there&#8217;s a danger in just saying, oh, new channel, new channel, new channel, and not mastering one single channel at a time and understanding your unit economics and how that works for your business,” he said, explaining that building a consistent and transparent brand story comes down to three essential pillars: “understanding your customer, understanding the channel, and understanding what message resonates with what channel is really important to get that cohesive feel across all those channels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Siobahn Sweeney, a Sales Leader at Shopify Retail, believes that embracing an omnichannel approach can help create a seamless shopping experience, which can make a lasting brand impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I think about delivering a really seamless shopping experience, I think about wanting to provide something that’s unique depending on where that customer is interacting with my band, and yet consistent. So, I think it’s really important for brands to embrace this whole idea of omnichannel. It’s about creating a single customer experience across your brand in all those channels and touch points along the way.”</p>



<h3>Taking Advantage of the Data&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A data-centric approach to retailing and marketing is one of the fundamental shifts over the last few years –&nbsp;and in particular the last few months – and D2C brands have been on the forefront of this movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We measure everything from how a specific customer group acts over time to how products do in-store vs. online,” said Helali. “All decisions stem from data and then putting the processes in place so that you’re interpreting that data correctly and taking the actions that are required.”</p>



<p>This granular use of data is how many D2C brands have managed to reach and understand their audience on a deeper level than brands before – and there are many resources available to newly founded brands. Shopify, for example, empowers merchants to use data with their own set of analytics tools.</p>



<p>“When it comes to our merchants that work with us, we have quite a robust amount of data that we are able to share with them from a reporting perspective,” said Sweeney, adding that Shopify uses data in-house as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We use data to inform our marketing strategy the exact same way that we do our product team,” she said.</p>



<p>Stein added that those leading a D2C brand will benefit from thinking adopting a data-driven approach early on, as major retailers look for these numbers when stocking their stores.</p>



<p>“When you are moving into the retail environment as a D2C brand, more and more retail stores care about this data, they are very aware of your metrics on every social platform, and it feeds into your pitch in a big way. So capturing that data and having that structure early on allows you to move into different directions in a really seamless way.“</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>How Brands are Winning on TikTok</strong> panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on July 22nd, and thousands of professionals tuned in to learn how leading brands have adopted the world’s fastest-growing social media platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/440998240" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>In Q1 of 2020, TikTok was downloaded more than 315 million times worldwide, which is the best quarter ever recorded by any app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform is known for its unique style of video – including dancing and voiceover comedy – and has become a key channel for digital marketers to reach Gen Z customers. Much of its growth is down to its simplicity – it is arguably the easiest social media platform to use when it comes to video editing, using music, and adding filters – and the fact that’s impossible to put down; TikTok’s algorithms quickly learn user preferences by capturing likes, comments, and time spent on each video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as with any new social media platform, there is a steep learning curve for brands hoping to create content that feels natural and engages users. And when attempting to connect with the most media-savvy generation in history, this can be trickier than ever before.</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways leading brands are building their brand on TikTok.</p>



<h2>Create for TikTok</h2>



<p>Chipotle was the first restaurant to partner with TikTok in the U.S., and the brand has been praised for its use of the platform through campaigns like the #GuacChallenge and #ChipotleLidFlip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latter was a “challenge” that asked TikTok fans to dance to a song by Dr. Jean about guacamole. The campaign was successful because it felt organic and natural to the platform, mixing music, dancing, pop culture, and a sense of silliness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were the first restaurant brand to do a hashtag challenge, and 59 thousand people ended up doing the lid flip,” said Candice Beck, Senior Manager, Social and Digital Marketing at Chipotle, explaining that the brand has also run TikTok-specific campaigns on National Burrito Day, among others. “We often find pretty big success when we can align a brand moment with a cultural moment like that,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chipotle’s efforts have paid off; they now have more than 800 thousand followers and 11 million likes on TikTok.</p>



<p>“We get so much more engagement on TikTok than other social channels. It’s by far a priority channel for us,” said Beck, explaining that her team has daily 15-minute meetings to discuss content for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are really coming to TikTok right now for happy content. I go there to get some of that uplighting, fun, user content that’s been necessary to bring a bit of joy recently&#8230;we’re using our channels pretty similarly. We’re not using organic presence for PR so much, even driving new products. We’re taking insights that we’ve learned from the platform itself and applying that every time we share a new piece of content.”</p>



<p>Jason Berk, Head of Social and Digital at Sid Lee, believes this is the best approach when it comes to developing a content strategy for TikTok.</p>



<p>“What I constantly tell [clients] is you cannot repurpose your content from other platforms on TikTok. Not only will not work; it’ll backfire. It needs to be quick, relevant content as well. There needs to be a willingness to move fast,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Understand What TikTok Is</h2>



<p>You might think TikTok is nothing but teenage girls lip-syncing in their rooms, but according to Berk, you would be mistaken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tiktok is not a singular platform with a reputation, it’s a lot of different communities and a lot of different people talking in a lot of different ways&#8230;I think that’s the reason why it’s become this de-facto trend factory. Once something goes big in a community, it catches fire and everyone supports that,” Berk said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaleb Ruel, Head of US Consumer Marketing at Spotify, explains that this trend-setting ability makes TikTok stand out from other media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“TikTok is a place where we go to participate in that cultural narrative, and success looks a lot different in that sense. We’re not looking at the same media metrics and bottom line impact on the business,” he said, adding that Spotify has seen success mixing organic and paid media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The biggest lesson for us is that when you have a TikTok challenge alone it’s fantastic, but when you have a challenge that’s coupled with other harder driving media, like larger ad placements that are more marquee, that’s when we see the highest impact.”</p>



<h2>Focus on Authenticity&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Another way TikTok has stood out from the crowd is for the supposed “realness” of its content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Instagram is hyper-filtered and the content that brands partner with there tends to be as well. TikTok tends to be the complete opposite. I’d say authentic and raw are common terms that I hear,” Ruel said.</p>



<p>Berk agrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of realness on TikTok – like the LGTBT community coming out and talking about their stories. That creates solidarity and it’s a little more serious, it unites a community,” he said, adding that this creates an unvarnished, safe place. “On Instagram you have to look your best, you have to be the prettiest, you have to be the envy of your circle of friends. On TikTok, it’s a little safer to show some of your fears and concerns and losses and some of these universal emotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>TikTok may, therefore, feel riskier than other platforms from a brand’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think every brand belongs on TikTok. I think you really have to know your brand ethos and what you stand for and how you stand for it. The ones that do a good job are unapologetic about being there,” Ruel said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most successful brands on TikTok are also vigilant about keeping up with trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The team is constantly mining for UGC about Chipotle, new trends, new insights, specifically on TikTok&#8230;we’re looking for any new posts from other users that we can comment on or anything we should repost or a trend we should consider. So, we’re in deep,” Beck said, adding that this shouldn’t scare brands away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get on there experiment, see what your followers like. [&#8230;] Don’t be intimidated by creating the perfect video; we’ve found a lot of success with some of our comments on other people&#8217;s posts about Chipotle. It’s not about creating the perfect TikTok that meets Gen Z’s liking.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Berk, it all comes down to remembering what you’re trying to do: make videos to connect and have some fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Make the channels and start putting videos out. A lot of people on my team have become pseudo influencers&#8230;It doesn’t cost a lot to make these kinds of videos, so I would say just do it.” <br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The<strong>&nbsp;How Brands Are Winning With Data-Driven Marketing&nbsp;</strong>panel discussion, the latest in&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on June 24th, and professionals around the world tuned in to discuss the impact data has had on marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/432352130" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>The exponential growth of online consumption in recent months has made marketing all the more competitive and nuanced. Now the world’s best brands are relying on data to identify new market opportunities, develop and measure marketing initiatives, and optimize campaigns and content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today and in the future, leveraging data for your marketing will keep you ahead of the competition and help you to cater more directly to your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways brands are benefiting from a data-driven marketing approach. </p>



<h2>Limiting the Guesswork</h2>



<p>2020 has forced many organizations to accelerate digital transformation initiatives, particularly in marketing, where digital channels and eCommerce have taken center stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve transitioned from an era where marketing was an art and now it’s definitely a science,” said Deborah Tampubolon, the Director of Marketing, Customer Acquisition at Home Point Financial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As marketers, we’ve always had to be very good storytellers, and now it’s not a question of understanding just the story to tell the audience, it’s the story of understanding what the data is telling you,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jeremy Silkowitz, the Director of Ecommerce at L&#8217;Oreal Luxe, agrees and believes that a more data-driven approach has taken the guesswork out of marketing ideation, helping brands better tailor marketing to their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What are their shopping behaviors? Where are they engaging? What is working and what is not working? Taking that approach and applying it, we can make sure we’re getting results,” he said, adding that data-driven marketing allows for ongoing optimization.&nbsp;“We’re constantly scrutinizing product pages and looking at analytics to see where conversion is low and how we can quickly make adjustments.”</p>



<h2>Showing Measurable Results</h2>



<p>Marketers who use data to track and measure performance can better direct campaign efforts, adjustments, and demonstrate which channels will result in the best return on investment. For example, the volume of email marketing sent across industries increased by 26 percent in the last three months, with open rates and conversions up by 31 and 22 percent from this time last year. Data like this can help marketers get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>“First and foremost, [data] has made every marketing dollar more accountable,” said Rahul Chowdhury, the Head of Marketing, eBusiness at RB. “We ask ourselves every day, ‘is this moving the needle?’ When you start doing that, you quickly see that search and social media have been elevated,” he said, adding that the rise of data-driven marketing will only increase the amount of testing and experimentation. </p>



<p>“Data-driven marketing has moved us from an era of MadMen to being able to truly test and learn; to get insights by understanding consumers and customers better,” Chowdhury said. </p>



<p>Silkowitz agrees, explaining that L’Oreal has experimented with increased video content and paid social advertising over the last few months, but always keeping an eye on performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everything needs to ladder back to an expectation in return, in making sure that we&#8217;re going to get a return out of any decision to invest time and money. So we develop business cases to understand, as we make these optimizations, what will it trigger – increased engagement or conversion – and then we’re able to track that on an ongoing basis to show that those changes were impactful,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Testing to Define Long-Term KPIs</h2>



<p>A Marketing Week study found that only 24 percent of B2B marketers run campaigns that last longer than six months, a trend that may have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and the need to cover short-term losses.</p>



<p>In <em>The Long and the Short of It</em>, authors Les Binet and Peter Field suggested that while short-term tactics are important for sales, growth and profit are driven by long-term tactics like brand building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting a data-driven approach can help in this regard, encouraging a longer lens and a culture of experimentation, both of which allow organizations to identify trends and gaps in performance over time. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re testing and launching every single week because every week there&#8217;s something new to learn. It&#8217;s too easy to say I&#8217;m going to plan X weeks of a campaign and then I can go on my virtual vacation, but you can&#8217;t do that – there is no rest for the marketers,” said Tampubolon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nothing happens overnight; it takes 30-60-90 days if you&#8217;re lucky to see real changes,” she said, adding that a long-term approach often requires a mindset shift.  </p>



<p>“It&#8217;s an advantage to have a view on what you expect your sales to look like, what budgets you think you’ll have,” Silkowitz added. But, he also warned that long-term planning needs to be flexible and adjust on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plans can change quite significantly vs. what we thought our business was going to look like, but the ability to react quickly, adapt, and shift resources is critical as you experience changes.”</p>



<h2>Continue Learning</h2>



<p>In the end, continuous learning is a job necessity for marketers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The digital space is so quickly changing that you never get a grasp of it,” Chowdhury said, adding that as we rely more on data, it can mean rethinking strategies from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can professionals stay ahead in a data-driven world?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Skills can always be acquired and BrainStation is a great example of that,” Tampubolon said. “But we also need a mindset shift. We used to have big picture thinkers and small, on-the-ground thinkers, but now people have to be flexible and think big <em>and </em>small. We&#8217;re in a global economy now.”<br></p>

<p><strong>Finding the Balance: Growth vs. Brand Marketing</strong>, a BrainStation Digital Leadership Event, attracted thousands of professionals from the world eager to better understand the balance between growth and brand marketing.  </p>



<p>You can watch the panel event here: </p>

<p>As always, the panelists touched on a number of topics, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Defining brand, growth and performance marketing</li><li>Team structure and how marketing teams work together</li><li>Emerging tools and tactics&nbsp;</li><li>The most in-demand marketing skills</li><li>Measuring campaign performance</li></ul>



<p>Discussing the internal struggle many companies have balancing growth versus brand marketing, Lyft’s Whitney Bell came to the defense of brand-building initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The tension [between brand and performance marketing] is something we struggle with all of the time. It&#8217;s easy to say &#8216;with this incentive we can show this ROI or CPA,&#8217; but it can be a struggle getting [stakeholders] to understand that an investment in branding is just that – an investment. We can&#8217;t always give in to those shorter-term pressures,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, though, the panelists agreed that a balance is almost always best, as Trouva’s Juliet Warkentin explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is nothing that happens at Trouva that happens in a silo. We do not succeed as a business unless we are integrated and supportive of each other&#8217;s projects and KPIs,” she said. </p>
