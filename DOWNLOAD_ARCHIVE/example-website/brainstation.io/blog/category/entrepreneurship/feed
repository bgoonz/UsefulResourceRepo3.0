<p>Miami&#8217;s Digital Future: Success in 2021 and Beyond – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 24, and featured four of Miami&#8217;s tech titans from <strong>Softbank Group International</strong>, <strong>Cisneros</strong>, and <strong>aïre ventures</strong>, and special guest Francis Suarez, <strong>Mayor of Miami</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/528967739" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Miami’s digital landscape has exploded over the past few years, especially in 2020 as global companies continue to tap into Miami’s unique ecosystem of highly-qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>Our Vice President and General Manager of BrainStation Miami, Johanna Mikkola, connected with Leigh-Ann Buchanan from <strong>aïres ventures</strong>, Adriana Cisneros, Chief Executive Officer at <strong>Cisneros</strong>, Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at <strong>SoftBank Group International</strong>, and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, to discuss how Miami can capitalize on this unique moment to ensure prosperity for businesses and tech talent.</p>



<h2>Turning Miami Into a Tech Hub</h2>



<p>During an active moment on social media, where people were discussing the possible future for tech in Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez typed four words that would shift the conversation for good: How can I help?</p>



<p>“I had no expectation that it would be the kind of viral sensation that it was,” said Suarez about his offer to help promote technological growth in the city. “We have been trying to systematically create a tech ecosystem in Miami for the past 10 years. Changing the reputation of a city is like moving a cruise ship&#8230;. I felt like I went out there and got a bunch of tugboats and just dropped them onto the cruise ship and just turned it as fast as I could.”</p>



<p>Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at Softbank International Group, recently moved to Miami himself, and is excited about what the city has to offer. “We kind of understand that when you have a confluence of technological shifts and geography that&#8217;s ready, you get really explosive outcomes.”</p>



<p>“It’s been fun to see when you have a lot of smart people living in the same area,” said Adriana Cisneros, CEO of Cisneros. “The local initiatives, universities, and professors who are in touch and very smart people wanting to help up [Miami’s] game.”<br></p>



<h2>Be Intentional With Inclusivity</h2>



<p>With the increased buzz around South Florida’s budding entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is then the issue of accessibility for those wanting to participate. Leigh-Ann Buchanan emphasized that diversity, equity, and inclusion opportunities don’t happen by accident. They require intentional and frequent communications in order to design the right solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is so much that we can do,” Cisneros added. “There is the notion of inspiring by example. We shouldn’t do things to tick boxes, we should do them because they’re good for business and are the right thing to do.”</p>



<p>“We have a blank canvas as we grow the ecosystem at a feverish pace,” said Suarez. “But to create an equal playing field is to empower particularly children&#8230;and adults who are supposed to have the same set of tools. We need to support organizations that are working and creating opportunities in an equitable fashion and Miami has the opportunity to get it right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the needs and the current technical abilities, there are, however, a few gaps that need to be addressed to support the growth Miami has the potential to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no talent gap, but there is a skills gap,” said Nyatta. “[Softbank is] focused on bridging that digital skills gap in Miami. But there is also a permission gap, as ecosystems that are centred around entrepreneurship often don’t give permission for young people to take risks. This has been the secret sauce of Silicon Valley, giving people permission to screw up and unlocking that permission is the most powerful thing a person can do for growth.”</p>



<p>With post-graduate programs focused on providing digital skills training and Miami becoming a study destination for students, Cisneros is excited to see what is in store for the next wave of workers.</p>



<p>“Miami is still a new city. I’ve heard people say it’s like a silly putty in that you can shape it into what you want it to be. People want to hear about what you&#8217;re working on. Compared to other cities, it&#8217;s genuinely welcoming and you don’t need to have money or power to be accepted into a group you&#8217;re interested in.”<br></p>



<h2>Embrace the Global Yet Local Opportunities</h2>



<p>Buchanan described Miami as a visionary city in what it can support and what people can bring into the community. As it relates to digital talent, Mayor Francis acknowledged there is more than training alone that needs to be done to further Miami’s digital future.</p>



<p>“Our infrastructure [needs to] keep pace with the growth that we’re innovating,” he said. “We obviously want to focus on continuing to make Miami affordable, not just through public private partnerships on affordable housing, but making sure that we have continued supply of housing and which thankfully we do.”</p>



<p>Physical infrastructure plans have also included having direct flights to Asia, which would make Miami one of the most accessible American cities.</p>



<p>Nyatta noted, “A lot of the Miami talk has been about Miami and the U.S: Miami versus Silicon Valley, Miami versus Austin. The discussion I haven&#8217;t heard as much, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s happening is Miami is a global metropolis&#8230;Miami is Hong Kong. Miami is Singapore. Miami is Dubai. It is a culturally situated city with very powerful cultural dynamics that are super interesting and unique and specific and authentic with global potential, with a global airport, with global access.”</p>



<p>With his sights on international connections, Mayor Francis is already thinking ahead on how Miami can get involved with the next generation of verticals such as deep machine learning, Cryptocurrencies, and HealthTech.</p>



<p>“We want to be positioned to be the city that is most forward thinking,” he said. “What that means is as our children grow, they have permission to dream, succeed, and fail and have the ecosystem to support that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think this focus on talent is important,” said Cisneros. “Of course good companies always attract talent, but it&#8217;s also very cool to be able to grow the talent from the 305. It’s good for them and it’s good for the city.”</p>



<p>Nyatta noted that while the energy and excitement is excellent fuel, there needs to be continued strategy year over year to solidify the success Miami is poised to achieve.</p>



<p>“This is not even a marathon, it&#8217;s like an ultra marathon. Maintaining intention and strategic clarity over decades is actually the trick, not just a couple of quarters of buzz. Finding ways to build that intentionality into institutions that outlast political cycles, that outlast fund lives is the trick. I think trying to embed these ideas as much as we can into things that will outlive us is the task at hand rather than let&#8217;s just create a lot of attention right now.”</p>



<p>Mayor Suarez agreed, adding that an effective long-term plan starts with preparing Miamians for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The truth that we all understand is tech is here to stay. If we want to create an equitable economy, we need to provide the right tools and opportunities for people to access those tools.”<br></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite earning a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Matthew Mayers knew he wanted to be in the tech industry. So after a few years of side-hustles and working as an Engineer, he applied for the UX Design Diploma Program BrainStation.</p>



<p>We spoke with Mayers about his foray into tech, how the BrainStation experience bolstered his entrepreneurial spirit, and what it’s like to be a Co-Founder of <a href="http://rallylegal.com">Rally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QBmeKrma43aIW_iTtUtPkkL_2NvVDnz3yNw6dJSMvRR8VSFIWeRpBrZbOdySXc31vLk26x22C0AC6RglTFMYzulWoRzDD6qFEOwTxd6JVrTn97sjsEQvDctRCYlFz_m0O4drLV99" alt="Picture of founder, Matthew Mayers."/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>What does a typical day look like for you as a Co-Founder of Rally?</strong></h2>



<p>Every day is different and that&#8217;s why I love my job. As a Co-Founder, my responsibilities range from product design, to customer success, to accounting, to recruitment, to development. Some days are filled with meetings, others are quiet and focused. I start every day by asking myself, &#8220;What set of actions can I take today to add the most value for my company and team?&#8221; Sometimes that means weighing in on a high-stakes product discussion, other times it means running to the post office to buy stamps.</p>



<h2><strong>How did the idea for Rally first come about? What problem does it aim to solve?</strong></h2>



<p>Shortly after completing my <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">program at BrainStation</a>, I was approached by my co-founder Daniel Di Maria (a fellow BrainStation graduate) with an idea. Based on his previous experience as a lawyer, he believed that there were many opportunities to drive improvement within the legal industry. He envisioned a world in which entrepreneurs could affordably manage the legal state of their companies in a streamlined, digital fashion. Automation could be used to help their lawyers and paralegals get work done faster, more accurately, and more enjoyably.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/v40S_ioFWgO9MZfphotq3mkZEChMuDDdwVB3iUJm3JfVTap6D1JSD0pUJGYIsmPW56cl8DqIlYjXdrh8wx8HtcfA-F8Ze9xbP_X36-7gpcfWsIYOn9X89MqQxBdP5wQhuU0wegmN" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<p>Having already experienced my first shot at entrepreneurship, the idea immediately resonated as I had struggled to find affordable legal services. I ended up doing much of my legal work myself and incorrectly.</p>



<p>We soon met our other Co-Founder, Scott Stevenson, who was serendipitously developing a similar concept. Now, three years in, our ideas have grown and evolved but we still aim to solve the same problems – legal services remain too expensive, inefficient, and inaccessible.</p>



<h2><strong>What has been the response you’ve received for Rally?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Legal service providers are feeling a tremendous amount of pressure (especially in a post-COVID world) to adopt technology which enables legal work to be done better and more affordably. Purchasers of legal services are fed up with the antiquated ways of operating and are pleading with their providers to catch up with the modern, digital world. <br><br>More and more forward-thinking service providers are approaching us with a desire to provide a better client-experience and it&#8217;s highly rewarding to be equipping these drivers of positive change. We sincerely believe that this is just the beginning for the legal industry. Massive transformations will be demonstrated in the coming years and we look forward to doing our small part to help.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hrqDeEeVqEgSaOI6czqkfTA0vT6wrdnyghoE3T8btZmHsxK5sLvPc5t36R8rcbxn5a9UHm-W6hPxVcBpIl2aE9H8zq01bOCIgY6iir2AuBSqMxU0ZLs-zrrG0HeEdeOpidvgSLIO" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<h2><strong>What made you decide to apply to the User Experience Diploma Program?</strong></h2>



<p>I have always been deeply fascinated by the intersection of human behavior and technology. User experience design is so much more than the selection of fonts and colours. Digital design has the power to alter how people see themselves, interact with each other, and engage with the world around them. Through BrainStation, I aimed to achieve a deeper understanding of how to harness this power. I wanted to develop both my creativity and technical acumen to improve people&#8217;s lives through innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How did the skills you learned at BrainStation contribute to how you designed your product?</strong></h2>



<p>At BrainStation, I learned how to take a step back and ask the right questions before starting to build. Who are we building for? What are their biggest pain-points? Where are the greatest opportunities to improve people&#8217;s workflows? What do they want, not just from products but from their lives? What do they need?</p>



<p>We spent several months speaking with potential customers, asking these questions and iterating on mockups before writing a single line of code. We have since developed a design-first culture and answering the &#8216;why&#8217; always comes before the &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;how.&#8217; We&#8217;re proud that even our talented development team is involved in the process from the very early stages of design to help ensure we&#8217;re building the right tools for our customers.</p>



<h2><strong>What challenges have you faced in creating a seamless user experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most challenging aspects of designing Rally is accounting for multiple, distinct user types, each with their own unique goals and behavior. While our customers are legal service providers, they use Rally as their client-facing interface. It&#8217;s a two-sided product – similar to a marketplace with buyers and sellers. Accommodating the various “jobs-to-be-done” of each persona while providing a frictionless, unified experience necessitates working relentlessly with our customers and their clients to continuously gather insights. <br><br>Every Designer learns about the value of customer feedback but sorting, filtering, and prioritizing insights is a highly nuanced and ever-evolving process.</p>



<h2><strong>What was a highlight of your BrainStation learning experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While learning the core executional skills of UX Design was one of the best educational experiences of my life, I particularly enjoyed the group discussions focused on the philosophy and ethics of design. Thanks to my instructors, Alex Chong and Brad MacDonald, there were many opportunities to dive into the rich, existential questions of what it means to design. These conversations forever changed my understanding of how the application of science through technology impacts humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_U60H4P8p6Y9Gj-CfoFxbMwMtfUoutUUXwzI27cjaNDTHGqEtWzhbH8A1ufmZR8vDTtTH6qZkdKbZ-XVImw4SawX6-yqJ5EcnjHEuIC-8NMEhmoS23FBchrCFLGNquQNrMgiLvha" alt="Group of young students gathered around a computer in class."/></figure>



<h2><strong>You hired Tiffany Chan, a fellow BrainStation graduate. How did you connect?</strong></h2>



<p>We did! We recently had the opportunity to recruit for an entry-level position and couldn&#8217;t think of a better place to look than the bootcamp ecosystem. We got in touch with Michael Bennett, BrainStation&#8217;s Career Success Manager, who connected us with Tiffany. With her experience both as a student in the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development program</a> and then as a TA, she was able to hit the ground running at Rally from her first day. Our team is now almost half BrainStation graduates!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What would you say are some essential digital skills needed to succeed in business?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The single most essential digital skill I would suggest for anyone in the tech industry is developing a foundational understanding of how code works. You don&#8217;t need to become a certified Software Engineer or even gain true proficiency – but you will have a massive advantage knowing a bit about what&#8217;s under the hood to confidently assess feasibility and effort requirements for new functionality. This applies to Designers, Marketers, Product Managers – everyone. Learning the basics of code has made me a much more effective team member even though most of my job doesn&#8217;t require any coding at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What advice would you give to aspiring UX Designers?</strong></h2>



<p>Designing for an idealistic world with rigid processes will only get you so far. In the real world there are technological constraints, market sizing concerns, budgets, and timelines that all need to be considered. Learning to understand everyone else&#8217;s role within a team (such as marketing, finance, development, etc.) and their requirements is as important as designing for the end-user. This is how you move beyond pipe dreams and toward product designs that actually get built and used in real life. By gaining a sense of the big picture and approaching your process with an appropriate level of flexibility, you will find yourself integrating business and technical requirements into your designs at earlier stages.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p><strong>Stepping Up: Canada’s Next Digital Chapter </strong>– the final installment in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s 2020 Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on December 3 and featured leaders from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Hootsuite</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>EY,</strong> and <strong>Rogers Communications</strong>.</p>

<p>Canada’s digital landscape has exploded over the past two decades, with home-grown companies claiming their rightful place on the world stage. Meanwhile, global companies continue to tap into Canada’s unique ecosystem of highly qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>We spoke with technology experts from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Hootsuite</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>EY,</strong> and <strong>Rogers Communications</strong> to share insights about what makes Canada a place for thriving business, and what Canada can do to continue fostering homegrown talent.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Pivot From Resources to Resourcefulness&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Elana Chan, Head of B2B Marketing at Google agrees with the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, that Canada is shifting from a resource-based economy, to a resourcefulness based economy.</p>



<p>More than 97 percent of the Canadian economy is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB), making them the backbone of the economy today. The ability for SMBs to become more digitally savvy with search engine optimization and social media will become essential to reach an international audience and continue growing.</p>



<p>“Fewer than 10 percent of our SMB export. Yet we know that those that do grow two times faster than others,” said Chan.</p>



<p>Chan continued, “We&#8217;re one of the only G7 countries with trade agreements with all the other G7 countries. So we have all the conditions to export more Canadian goods.”</p>



<p>Adapting to the given circumstances and pursuing new opportunities is a resilience woven deep into the Canadian identity. This is continuously tested as large firms pivot to stay connected and relevant in the minds of consumers.</p>



<p>“Competition is coming from everywhere, even from non-traditional competitors with the big tech firms entering into non-traditional sectors that they weren&#8217;t originally playing in, like financial services. Legacy brands are now finding ways to go direct-to-consumer rather than playing the B2B game,” said Stephen Megitt, Executive Strategy Director at EY.</p>



<p>Despite the evolving strategies from the heavily resourced firms, Megitt sees Canada’s big opportunity to stave off competition coming from entrepreneurial pursuits. “There&#8217;s a lot of small tech startups that are now competing against larger ones. This is primarily fuelled by a strong entrepreneurial environment within Canada.”</p>



<p>Jon de la Mothe, Vice President, Ad Product and Operations for Rogers Communications, has seen the technological transformations Canada has undergone over the past decades. When assessing Canada’s current position against international competitors, “We&#8217;re not playing catch up anymore,” he said.</p>



<p>Tom Keiser, CEO at Hootsuite embraces the disruption that is on the horizon. “We&#8217;re the dominant players. Some of [the panelist companies] are in dominant positions, and have been now for over a decade and we are going to get disrupted. Just like we&#8217;ve been disrupting those before us. The acceleration of disruption with the acceleration of technologies is going to be the norm.”</p>



<p>“We should probably all stop calling it digital transformation and just call it transformation or business transformation,” said Megitt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations are making investments into technology and bringing experiences to life in a matter of weeks that previously would have taken months or years to complete. This requires a workforce and culture with significant agility to tackle the challenge of a compressed innovation cycle, and the opportunity that it can offer.</p>



<p>Leanne Gibson, Head of Industry at Facebook &amp; Instagram Canada said, “We see an urgent imperative for brands to accelerate the pace of e-commerce adoption in Canada and frankly, around the world. With that, skills are required.”</p>



<p>“Every company now is a digital company,” said Chan. “That&#8217;s the only way to succeed, and digital skills are going to be the rising tide that raises all ships.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Raise Your Hand to Reskill</h2>



<p>As industries shift, there is a growing disconnect between available skills and available positions.</p>



<p>“We now are fighting for the same talent across industries,” said Megitt. “When you introduce this new context and [way of] doing things, every single company is now looking to have the same set of players on their team that can focus more in design thinking, human centered design, and UX.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Demand is already outstripping supply across product, across design, across engineering in Canada,” said Keiser. “As the public cloud continues to evolve and really everything becomes digitized and digital products, the demand for being able to bring that cohesively together into a design and aesthetic that is easy, navigable and delightful&#8230;only becomes more and more important. Having that foundational set of skills becomes more important than ever for the success of anyone working in the digital space.”</p>



<p>Chan sees Canada’s success over the next 10 years linked to how well we retrain existing workers, “I don&#8217;t think we can leave people behind here. The digital divide is going to be really real and problematic if we cannot have basic digital skills for a wider population.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For professionals mid-career, changing track and learning new digital skills can be destabilizing. Chan, however, believes that you should not discount your current skill set. Rather, lean into your experience and transferable skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in tech for a while, and there are a lot of transversal skills that we&#8217;re looking for, that people in more traditional, quote unquote, industries have,&#8221; Chan said, adding that you sometimes just have to take a risk. &#8220;You have to make the jump, which is a little bit scary because it&#8217;s unknown. But a lot of these traditional companies hire very smart people. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking for [in tech].&#8221;</p>



<p>De la Mothe championed the proactive people that saw their roles evolve from where they started 20 years ago. “The folks that started first to begin that upskilling, cross-skilling are the ones that raised their hands and wanted to learn.”</p>



<p>Megitt sees the global value that Canadian talent offers, but that it will take foresight from Canadian-based companies to create the right kind of environment to keep talent invested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Companies all over the world are looking to grab talent from anywhere, because that&#8217;s the way that we work now.” He continued, “We as Canadians have to create the right short-term and long-term opportunities to help keep the talent here and keep introducing and innovating new technology, new products within those experiences.”</p>



<p>Fostering tech talent goes beyond the current pool of potential workers, Megitt sees the need for collaboration between social institutional structures like education and government to prepare emerging talent for the job market that has yet to be created.</p>



<p>“It can’t start when they get a job. It needs to start early on in life to expose them to STEM and to expose them to careers that they thought weren’t for them. We need to work with [academia and] the government more to create incentives and programs that will train and nurture tech talent, and give them a reason beyond just the job to stay [in Canada] and continue to work and develop the fabric of Canadians.”&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Adapt Alongside Users and Employees</h2>



<p>With human-centred experiences being emphasized in almost every industry, Megitt notes that offering opportunities to lift others up is a strength that companies should be leveraging to create a more well-adapted, strengthened workforce.</p>



<p>“When everyone has opportunities to contribute and you have a diverse perspective and you have a diverse workforce, you&#8217;re going to generate great quality products and experiences.”</p>



<p>Chan said, “As we grow, as we&#8217;re getting more Canadian talent and we&#8217;re reskilling, I think we have to really be thoughtful of great representation across the board.”</p>



<p>“[Canadians] are all really proud of our multicultural society that we live in. At Google, we think about how important it is to be representative of our users. You can&#8217;t be representative of your users if your teams and values aren&#8217;t also reflecting those views,” she continued.</p>



<p>Keiser spoke to how brands and organizations need to assess their values and to actively reflect them through all experiences as consumers become more value-focused. “They are really thinking about who they want to do business with. They want to do business with entities that they&#8217;re aligned with on values.”</p>



<p>Megitt referred to Michael Bierut’s definition of a brand as not something a company creates; rather, it is created by the people that give the brand meaning. “How a consumer interacts with a brand is the meaning that is going to be associated with that brand. So ultimately, experience becomes brand. How [your company] goes about creating those experiences for your customers or for your employees will ultimately ascribe the value to the brand that you have.”</p>



<p>Social media has become a common method to connect brand and identity in order to build the one-to-one relationship and engage with their customers. In a year that has been dominated by change, Keiser advised that social listening is a skill all leaders need to utilize and continuously develop.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve seen a lot of big brands and companies make tremendous missteps by not listening and trying to dominate a conversation as opposed to really listening and participating in a conversation.”</p>



<p>“If we all put ourselves in the consumer&#8217;s shoes, we know our expectations are higher than they&#8217;ve ever been and that is not going to change, said Gibson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timely information has never been more relevant than in the digital age and the explosion of ecommerce. Companies are expected to be constantly in tune to the customer needs and deliver personalized, immediate experiences to the consumer.</p>



<p>“Consumers expect all brands to be omnichannel and to have a frictionless commerce experience wherever they go,” she added. “If they don&#8217;t get it, they will leave.” Despite this expectation, only 40 percent of Canadian businesses have an ecommerce website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With many opportunities being left on the table, businesses should be designing experiences with data-driven decisions and leveraging technology in a much better way.</p>



<p>“Customer expectations have evolved, employee expectations and evolved,” added Megitt. “Our context for everything that we used to do is now different. We may never get back to normal and we certainly can never go back to normal digital operations either.”<br></p>



<h2>Invest in Canada’s Future by Investing in Yourself</h2>



<p>What does all the evolution mean for the digital future of Canadian businesses and talent?</p>



<p>Companies looking for growth opportunities should be looking for talent that are in the pursuit of growth, and creating spaces that motivate them to thrive.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s hard to see where and how some of this disruption is going to take place. But it&#8217;s happening right now,” said Keiser. “It&#8217;s this continual acceleration of disruption and creating new and interesting opportunities and really every space that we&#8217;re where we do business in.”</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re learning about better ways of working and we&#8217;re learning about psychological safety and making sure people have what they need to actually be successful in this environment,” said Megitt.</p>



<p>One big decision individuals should be considering is how they are spending their time, and what can be invested today to earn sought-after rewards tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gibson advised that it is up to the individual to take advantage of the available options. “If you&#8217;re that curious person who prioritizes leaning in and being on a learning journey your entire career, the opportunities are really endless.”</p>



<p>Chan said, “The passion and the energy that you&#8217;re bringing to the table plus your talent is a really powerful combination. If you are leaning into your superpowers, you can help people overlook a lot of your gaps.” She continued, “Everyone here is talking about they&#8217;re looking for talent. [Companies are] looking for good people. They&#8217;re looking for very smart people who want to learn and grow and do better and solve interesting problems.”</p>



<p>Megitt championed the Canadian stereotype of a perceived politesse around the globe as a superpower in itself. “I love that stereotype because I think we are [nice]. We take care of each other and we take care of our own&#8230;Being nice will never mean that we finished last.”</p>

<h3><b>How did you break into the fashion industry? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I launched </span><a href="https://corduroiclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corduroi club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015, the concept of the brand is to focus on excellence. My goal for the company is to create quality products in limited quantities. I grew up with many talented, creative friends, and I hope to create a collaborative platform that constantly goes back and forth between new ideas and products. Over the past few years of running corduroi club, I have been fortunate to meet many like-minded creatives, artists, photographers, and brand owners from all over the globe that I would’ve never met otherwise. It opened up many doors for me when I decided to take the risk, put out my idea, and watch it grow little by little. </span></p>
<h3><b>How did you discover the demand for affordable, high-quality T-shirts? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, I was searching for quality T-shirts for myself. After researching and talking with people, I realized there is a potential market for mid-range quality T-shirts in North America. It really started off with a passion to find something that I love, which eventually led to researching production, finding a manufacturer, and next thing I know, I am setting up a business meeting and starting a clothing brand!  </span></p>
<h3><b>What inspired your branding and aesthetic? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">corduroi club’s aesthetic is really just a natural expression of my upbringing. It is a collage of all the things I’ve immersed myself in over the years: growing up in Hong Kong and Vancouver; reading Japanese magazines from early 2000s; studying jazz music in university &#8212; and placing all of those elements together into one project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized a lot of my inspiration comes from my fascination for street culture and design. You look at cities like Tokyo, Vancouver, and New York for example, how each of those cities have a certain atmosphere and feeling: the way people talk, the architecture, the sounds. All of these unique cultural expressions are what inspires me when I think in terms of branding and identity. With corduroi club, I hope to use these white T-shirts as a blank canvas to unravel the personality and individuality of each person wearing these simple quality garments. It’s an idea I am always thinking about and experimenting with: to create products that users can wear in their own style and expression. </span></p>

<h3><strong>At one point, you opened a temporary storefront for your T-Shirts. Why did you think it was important to have a Pop-up store? </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, thankfully my friends own a design studio and storefront in Kitsilano called SORT. I think it is always important to showcase the products in a physical space and allow customers to experience the products in person. I love meeting customers and interacting with them; I think it is a good way for me to receive feedback on how customers feel about the brand and how it is received. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup brand, I think it is special for me to discover who the early customers are and to be able to connect with them directly as friends. Their support is what encourages me to keep going and it has been a rewarding experience to see the brand and the customer base grow over the years. </span></p>

<h3>What made you decide to take a UX Certificate Course?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last year or so, I became very interested in the tech industry because a lot of my friends are programmers and designers. I realized the importance of UX design as a universal skill and how it aligns with the things that I do: designing business solutions (products) that ultimately help people solve problems and improve their daily experiences. </span></p>
<h3><b>What are some key lessons you learned from BrainStation that helped you design your brand and product? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the important skills I learned from the program are design thinking, user empathy, and understanding the importance of user-centric designs. Design thinking was a big one for me. When studying music, I was trained to practice and practice until I could play the drums better and faster, kind of like exercising and building muscles. But, it never really taught me to ask why, or how I should approach a problem when I am stuck. Starting a business can be really tough when everything begins with a trial and error process. I learned a lot from my mistakes and if I had learned about design thinking earlier on, it would’ve helped me strategize and plan ahead to create more optimal business decisions that would have saved time and money.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10685 alignright" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-819x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-960x1200.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600.jpg 1855w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What do you do to stay creative in your spare time? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my spare time, I usually read design articles on tech websites to keep up with the industry. I also love to research vintage clothing, watch skateboard videos, and read about Bauhaus designers and their approach.</span></p>
<h3><b>The UX Course teaches students to use a User Journey Map to organize ideas and plot research. How did you adapt this method from your UX training into planning your retail products? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key insights I discovered through my </span><a href="https://www.jameschoi.design/corduroiclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Journey Map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was understanding to address the moments when customers experience doubts during the shopping experience. Often, they are doubtful when they are unsure about their size, which is a common problem for online shopping. I try to alleviate those doubts by providing measurements of the shirts and reference photos on social media to show how the product fits on different body types. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10670 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-1024x594.png" alt="user journey map showing customer pain points" width="1024" height="594" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-1024x594.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-300x174.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-768x445.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-960x556.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM.png 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Do you think you’ll expand beyond the T-shirt space in the future? If so, will you follow the same process? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely, I still see corduroi club at it’s beginning stage and there are still so many projects I want to explore in the future. I am so glad and thankful for the strong support from customers all over the world. They really encourage me to move forward and continue to expand the label. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember one time my friend took a photo of a guy wearing a corduroi club tote bag at a concert in Tokyo, it was an incredible moment for me! I think the process is always refining and I am always learning new information about design and growing a business. I am always trying new things and I am excited to apply the things I have learned from BrainStation to grow the brand as well as my UX career in the tech industry. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re looking to improve yourself on a professional or personal level, it’s always a wise idea to emulate the best. And when it comes to developing good habits that encourage productivity, creativity, and general success, you’d be hard-pressed to find better role models than the founders of the world’s top startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Airbnb’s Brian Chesky to Stitch Fix’s Katrina Lake to Spotify’s Daniel Ek – or even the super-famous likes of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, or Mark Zuckerberg – when it comes to founders and CEOs, there are ties that seem to bind even the most seemingly dissimilar personalities. And in many cases, the connective tissue is in the small things – founders tend to have the discipline to set and stick to certain best practices in their day-to-day routines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we looked at the habits that most successful founders seem to share.</span></p>
<h2><b>They Make the Most of Every Minute</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, founders don’t have time to waste. And when it comes to maximizing every minute of their day, some have gotten pretty creative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk –  the CEO of Tesla and the mind behind SpaceX – said in 2016 that he was working 85 to 100 hours per week as he juggled both companies. How did he manage? One tactic was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">break his day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into five-minute slots. He’s even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">got</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the habit of wolfing down his lunch in just five minutes – usually during a meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the single best piece of advice: Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself,” he has </span><a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/13/elon-musk-secrets-of-effectiveness/#fqb.ktmW9mqD" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s not alone in finding creative ways to make the absolute most of his day. Capify CEO and founder David Goldin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedules</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of his most important calls during his morning commute. Anne Wojcicki of 23andme even stopped paying for parking largely because she doesn’t like wasting her time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get parking tickets all the time. We’ve worked out the stats and it’s 50-50 odds of getting a ticket and the cost versus time saved means I can accept it,” she </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/parking-illegally-makes-mathematical-sense-says-23andmes-wojcicki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><b>They Cherish Their Calendars</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With schedules regimented down to the last detail, founders seem to have few things they covet like their calendars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin makes her calendar a central focus of her day – and that of her team since she makes it public for all her direct reports to see how she spends her time. She’s not only meticulous about logging her appointments, but also reviewing her calendar to make sure she’s spending time on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am really crazy when it comes to my calendar. I’m hypervigilant about making sure that I spend time on the right things,” </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-founders-guide-to-discipline-lessons-from-fronts-mathilde-collin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Collin, whose shared inbox startup kicked off 2020 with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a $59 million Series C funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I don’t always know what I’m doing, then I get sucked into checking my emails or answering questions instead of focusing on what I said was most important at the beginning of the week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn’t just log the big events in her calendar. She blocks off larger chunks of time for a “time for culture” session in which she spends time considering her employees and whether they seem happy. She also books 15-minute blocks to write emails to her employees or read over recent research. She even has a 15-minute chunk of time blocked off specifically for reviewing her calendar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a unique time-management strategy while he was working eight hours per day at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the social-media company and pre-IPO Square. He created a theme for each day; Monday was for management, Tuesday was about product, Wednesday was devoted to marketing, communications, and growth, and so on. Not every day was devoted to work, of course – he took Saturdays off to hike and Sundays to reflect and strategize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many leaders also emphasize the importance of actually booking unscheduled time into their calendars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This enables me to get things done on the same day instead of allowing the guilt pile to build up,” </span><a href="https://time.com/4027015/business-success-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dr. Walter S. Scott, founder of satellite imagery company DigitalGlobe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am significantly more productive when I am not forced to multitask,” he added. “By creating pockets of time in which I can work alone, I am able to accomplish tasks on the same day and leave time for collaboration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carving out alone time during the workday is a priority for Spotify’s Daniel Ek as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also has another piece of advice for the bold: don’t be afraid to cancel a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just don’t have as many meetings as you think,” Ek </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90213545/exclusive-spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-on-apple-facebook-netflix-and-the-future-of-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Instead I have a lot of me time where I’m just thinking; I’m at a whiteboard drawing by myself. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I have a call or another meeting, I’ll just block it out if I’m in the zone,” he added. “That’s unorthodox because it means that you’re breaking social contracts, you’re disappointing someone because you didn’t show up. But if you’re really, really focused, those are the times when the breakthroughs come. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might go for three days and not sleep because I’m focused in that moment.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They Establish Rules Around Work-Life Balance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although different leaders have different thoughts on what work-life balance actually looks like, something founders seem to have in common is that they find an equilibrium that works for them – and then they establish clear rules around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re certainly motivated by creating a happy home life, but also by ensuring that they’re bringing their best self to the office each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Failure of your company is not failure in life. Failure in your relationships is,” </span><a href="https://medium.com/@ev/formula-for-entrepreneurial-success-ea0b02c504cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ev Williams, CEO of Medium and co-founder of Twitter. “When you don’t sleep, eat crap, don’t exercise, and are living off adrenaline for too long, your performance suffers. Your decisions suffer. Your company suffers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much demand on their time from inside and outside their companies, founders typically find it helpful to set clear boundaries. Tumblr’s David Karp </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t allow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laptops in the bedroom. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos wakes up naturally, without an alarm clock, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t schedule</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> morning meetings so he can spend time with his family. Boll &amp; Branch founders Scott and Missy Tannen make sure they’re home every day early enough to have a family dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be co-founders, but we are also mom and dad to three daughters. No matter how hectic running a fast-growing startup is, we make sure to shut off the cell phones and have a family dinner with our girls,” they </span><a href="https://time.com/4027015/business-success-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “While many CEOs are still going strong at six p.m., we’re passing the green beans and focusing on what matters most to us — our family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s most amazing is how many of our business and marketing ideas have come from our twin eight-year-olds and our 11-year-old right at the dinner table.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, oftentimes it’s having kids that prompt these leaders to finally surrender to a more sane schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that has been an adjustment being a new mom is that the morning is some of the most valuable time I have with my son,” </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-katrina-lake-the-founder-of-stitch-fix-2017-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stitch Fix’s Katrina Lake. “It used to be that I would check email and Instagram first thing in bed, and now as soon as he&#8217;s up, I&#8217;m up. I&#8217;ve really appreciated the clarity and being able to start the day in a more organic way with my son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really important for me to feel present when I&#8217;m at work, that I&#8217;m totally listening and paying attention and not worrying about what my son is doing. On the flip side, I try to bring that same level of being present at home. I want to feel totally present in everything I do.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They Take Care of Their Bodies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with impenetrably tight schedules, the world’s top founders seem to share a commitment to health and fitness – and some even have some quirky workout habits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a daredevil whose athletic interests </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">span</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gymnastics, high-flying trapeze, springboard diving, ultimate Frisbee and hockey. Mint.com founder Aaron Patzer lifts weights and runs, but he also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">loves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> climbing trees – a habit he picked up when he was 3. Other Founders find creative ways to weave wellness into their days; 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki is an admitted “fitness freak” who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">biked five miles to work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day while eight months pregnant. Apple’s Tim Cook </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wakes up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around 4:30 a.m. daily to ensure several trips to the gym per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this exercise isn’t just about looking good. Most draw a connection between their physical health and their job performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Staying in shape is very important,” </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-workout-routine-2015-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. “Doing anything well requires energy and you just have a lot more energy when you’re fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I make sure I work out at least three times a week – usually first thing when I wake up. I also try to take my dog running whenever I can, which has the added bonus of being hilarious because that’s basically like seeing a mop run.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They Set Goals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders juggle so many disparate concerns that it can be easy to lose sight of the big picture. So it’s not surprising that many are fastidious about setting clear goals and reviewing them often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, as part of his daily routine, Spotify’s Ek writes out his goals for the day, week, and month, and every evening he checks to see how he’s doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then I just allocate my time (to match the goals),” he said. “People think that creativity is this free spirit that has no boundaries. No, actually the most creative people in the world schedule their creativity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front’s Collin makes an effort not just to set goals, but to communicate them to the rest of her team. At 10 a.m. sharp every Monday morning, she sends a note to her direct reports outlining her goals for the week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about telling your reports every single thing you’re going to do. Rather, it’s a chance to share what’s top-of-mind for you, which of course should be top-of-mind for them,” she </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-founders-guide-to-discipline-lessons-from-fronts-mathilde-collin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadcasting her goals to her team also has the added benefit of keeping Collin focused, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I start to slip or if my weeks don’t ladder up to those big goals we’re focusing on, that sends the wrong message.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those goals should realistic, but also ambitious. In fact, Box co-founder Aaron Levie considered it one of his main roles with the cloud enterprise storage company to keep the company’s collective sights set high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Probably the biggest value that I add to this company is reminding people to push on the scale of the opportunity – to realize that they can do something 10 times bigger, 10 times better, 10 times faster,” he </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/23/8-companies-poised-to-disrupt-their-industries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><b>They Keep Informed</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the swift-moving startup world, staying on top means staying on top of what’s happening – and what the competition is up to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s easy to understand why many founders start their day with a deep dive through the news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I do once out of bed is read 15 to 30 minutes religiously,” </span><a href="https://time.com/4027015/business-success-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ahmed Albaiti, Founder and CEO of digital health innovation company Medullan. “I jot down anything interesting for rumination vis-à-vis healthcare, (such as) Netflix’s god mode or Jaguar’s brainwave tracker. It’s amazing how many dots you can connect by just reading.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdGreetz founder and CEO Eric Frankel says he reads “voraciously,” a habit he picked up much earlier in his career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My first job at Warner Bros. was preparing a daily press packet without internet,” Frankel </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/the-daily-habits-of-35-people-at-the-top-of-their-game.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I had to read everything physically, clip pertinent articles, copy and distribute them to execs. This job taught me the power one garners by knowing everything that’s going on in business and the world — who’s doing well and might be a candidate for a sale of a popular Warner Bros. TV series or movie and who is in trouble and might need a hit TV series or movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One needs to be able to converse with other executives intelligently about their business.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve talked about how New York may be </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-new-york-is-poised-to-surpass-silicon-valley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poised to surpass Silicon Valley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how Boston is experiencing a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-bostons-bioboom-means-for-the-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boom in the biotech industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we wanted to take a closer look at the growth of job markets on a state level. Are there larger regional trends that can help us pinpoint where the greatest career opportunities may exist?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out, we looked at </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/bdm/bdmstate.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and tracked the net amount of new businesses opened in every state over the last ten years. What we found was both expected and surprising in equal measures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the states that saw the largest net amount of new businesses in the last ten years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utah</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how the overall map looked:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9860 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901.png" alt="map of USA showing net amount of businesses opened" width="1000" height="932" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901.png 1000w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901-300x280.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901-768x716.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BSTN-Infographic-Net_Open_Businesses-e1570815232901-960x895.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a look at some of the more surprising states to make the list, starting with:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>The Growth of the Utah Job Sector</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most surprising about our findings were Utah and North Dakota ending up on the top five list. We’ll get to North Dakota later, but first, let’s take a look at what could be leading to Utah’s sudden entrepreneurial boom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Utah is on fire, relatively speaking. According to a report from Wells Fargo, the state’s economy is among the fastest-growing in the nation, which may be encouraging would-be entrepreneurs and investors alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s doing well for all the reasons you&#8217;d want to see an economy do well — mainly a fast-growing labor force [that] is very well-educated and young,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.deseret.com/2019/3/28/20669517/utah-economy-among-the-fastest-growing-in-u-s-here-s-why"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wells Fargo Economist Charlie Dougherty, adding that the economy is also among the most diverse in the nation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo’s report points to the development of new sectors like cloud computing, big data, and software development, as well as the growth of aerospace and life sciences as reasons for the state’s positive economic outlook. The numbers back this up. The growth in the number of tech jobs in the state has grown 4.9 percent over the last 10 years, which is more than triple the tech job growth rate of the United States as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Utah enjoyed the nation’s fastest job growth over the past 12 months, but according to federal data, it was actually the construction industry that led the way, expanding by 6.2 percent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that while Utah led the country in job growth by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">percentage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the states with the biggest increase in the number of new jobs were actually Texas (350,000), California (269,100), and Florida (170,500).&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Boston’s BioBoom Fuels Job Growth&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts&#8217; appearance on the top five list makes sense given the growth of the region’s biotech sector. The Boston area alone has </span><a href="https://www.massbio.org/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 1,100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> biotech and biopharma companies, academic centers, and life-science organizations, making it a world leader in this area. In fact, on FierceBiotech’s Fierce 15 list of the world’s most promising biotech companies, six of the 15 companies highlighted were based in the Boston area:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrakis Therapeutics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beam Therapeutics&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jnana Therapeutics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kronos Bio</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandion Therapeutics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass Therapeutics</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs in the biotech industry grew by 28 percent from 2008 to 2017, and by 4.3 percent in that final year alone. There are now more than 70,000 people employed in the industry in the state, averaging an annual wage of $149,731. If you’re doing the math, that means the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-bostons-bioboom-means-for-the-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts biotech workforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is bringing home just over $10.4 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, venture investment in the state’s biopharma companies was $3.1 billion in 2017. This is a staggering number when you consider that these Massachusets companies received 37 percent of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">biopharma VC dollars invested in the US that year. And while significant investment in the field comes from outside the state, there are well-established, local venture capital firms that specialize in the sector. F-Prime Capital, for example, was among the first VC companies to focus on biopharmaceuticals, medtech, and healthcare IT services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boston’s, and Massachusetts’, growth as a worldwide biotech hub has actually created a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/demand-for-talent-rising-amid-bostons-tech-industry-growth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talent shortage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially when it comes to tech-related jobs. The State of the Tech Economy report found that nearly 10,000 new tech jobs were added in Massachusetts in the previous year. A follow-up report, the Massachusetts Tech Pulse Index, meanwhile, found that 70 percent of tech employers expected to increase employment over the following six month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve had a long career in human resources and watched a lot of (hiring) cycles,” Russ Campanello, Executive Vice President of Human Resources at iRobot, </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/02/19/the-war-for-tech-talent-escalates/ejUSbuPCjPLCMRYlRZIKoJ/story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Boston Globe, “and this is as intense as any of them.”</span></p>
<h2><b>North Dakota Rides the Crude Oil Boom</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota may be another unexpected name on the top five list, but it’s not that surprising when you take a closer look. For one thing, North Dakota is riding an unprecedented oil boom. In fact, the U.S. is now producing more crude oil than any other country, and the state is playing a large role in that. Overall, North Dakota is the number two oil state in the US (behind Texas) and is now setting </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?f=M&amp;n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPND1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">production records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in oil production has had a clear impact on communities (and business creation) across the state. NPR recently focused on Watford City, which has seen its population more than tripled in the past decade, from 1,790 to 6,523.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our town is booming, our main street is full. You don&#8217;t go through little towns and see every storefront have a business in it. We do,&#8221; one resident </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/23/669198912/after-struggles-north-dakota-grows-into-its-ongoing-oil-boom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told NPR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in North Dakota is now at 2.6 percent, which is lower than the national average. The state’s population is also rising. In fact, of the 3,142 counties in America, there is only one that has grown by over 50 percent in the last eight years, and that county is Williams County, North Dakota, which grew 57.8 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That isn’t to say that North Dakota’s growing job market and population are exclusively related to oil. Inc. magazine recently included </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine North Dakota companies on its Inc. 5000 list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which highlights the nation&#8217;s fastest-growing companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were the ND companies that made the list, along with their industry and growth rates:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoSchedule, Bismarck, software,&nbsp; 2,771 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haga Kommer, Fargo, financial services, 1,482 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PRx Performance, Fargo, retail, 742 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BNG Team, West Fargo, business products and services, 148 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discovery Benefits, Fargo, health, 119 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hatch Realty, Fargo, real estate, 119 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myriad Mobile, Fargo, software, 80 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomsen Homes, Fargo, construction, 74 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedigree Technologies, Fargo, software, 57 percent</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s anything this list makes clear, it’s that the state’s economy is diversifying, with software and tech playing a much more prominent role, all of which bodes well for the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay tuned over the next few weeks as we take a closer look at each of the states listed here, particularly with regard to the growth of tech jobs.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming an entrepreneur isn’t easy –&nbsp;it takes grit, determination, and most importantly, the right skill set. Professional development courses are also a great way for entrepreneurs to develop the skills they need to start their own business. Meet </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monikaidzior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monika</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Founder of marketing firm </span><a href="https://www.idziorgroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDZIOR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who took BrainStation’s Digital Marketing Certificate Course before starting her journey into entrepreneurship.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Headshot_MI-1024x730.jpg" alt="Entrepreneur" class="wp-image-9831" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Headshot_MI-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Headshot_MI-300x214.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Headshot_MI-768x547.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Headshot_MI-960x684.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><b>Can you tell us about your education and career background?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My background is quite varied. I received an Honours Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto with concentrations in Economics and French. After graduation, I worked for the Government of Canada and then transitioned into marketing in the architecture and design industry. Earlier this year, I founded my own marketing firm, IDZIOR, whose mission is to help architecture, engineering, construction, and design firms with their social media presence and online and offline marketing needs.</span></p>



<p><b>What was your motivation behind taking the Digital Marketing Course?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to enrolling in BrainStation, the majority of my marketing expertise had come from my work experience and supplementary resources which I sought out on my own. Although this provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the tools and strategies available, I was interested in learning more about the theory behind the work I was doing from one consistent source with a different industry background. This, coupled with hands-on experience in a classroom setting made BrainStation the ideal complement to my existing digital marketing skill set.</span></p>



<p><b>What were some of the most valuable skills you gained during the course? Have these skills aided your professional development?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most valuable skills I gained were technical skills, notably those related to paid advertising and SEO. Paid advertising and Google algorithms are extremely intimidating at first, so having them broken down into digestible bits made the concepts easier to grasp. It was also great to hear about personal experiences and best practices from Instructors and Teaching Assistants to further solidify my own understanding.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These skills have tremendously aided my professional development, since they provided me with a deeper understanding of digital marketing, along with their methods of implementation. There is a benefit to learning about each individual component under the digital marketing umbrella as a whole, as this helps with the comprehension of how all individual parts move together under a greater strategy.</span></p>



<p><b>Can you describe the BrainStation learning experience? What was the highlight?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BrainStation learning experience was informative, interactive and most of all, a lot of fun. The Instructor and Teaching Assistants were credible marketing professionals who taught me a lot about digital marketing, and also really engaged the class in the process.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highlight of the course was the final group project, where we were tasked with creating a digital marketing strategy for a brand of our choosing. This was the perfect exercise to test us on what we had learned throughout the course and proved to be much more effective than traditional exams.</span></p>



<p><b>Did the skills you learned in the Digital Marketing course help you when starting your company, IDZIOR?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital marketing skills I learned significantly helped me when starting IDZIOR. Since the digital landscape changes almost daily, the Digital Marketing course allowed me to both update my current skill set and gain new skills in marketing.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course also helped me refine my public speaking skills, since we had multiple opportunities to present our analyses from in-class working sessions. This was an unexpected surprise that is extremely beneficial to a business owner, especially when it comes to participation in speaking engagements.</span></p>



<p><b>As the Founder of IDZIOR, what does a typical workday look like for you?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, no two days are the same. My weekdays usually start with a coffee, a podcast (currently listening to How I Built This with Guy Raz), and a brisk walk to the office.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I check my calendar first thing to see what’s on my schedule for the day and ensure that all client deliverables are ready to go out on time. I then start to work on deliverables for the following days, whether that be drafting and implementing social media and marketing strategies or creating marketing materials for my clients.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My afternoons are generally reserved for business development and client meetings around the GTA, however at times my work from the morning carries over into the afternoon or evenings, depending on the nature of deliverables. I love what I do, so I don’t mind working around the clock.</span></p>



<p><b>Why do you believe that digital skills training is important?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that digital skills training is extremely important since digital is at the forefront of everything. Most people spend the majority of their time on their phones or laptops, whether it be browsing online or consuming media, which further demonstrates that our society is rapidly shifting to a digital world. From a marketing perspective, 90 percent of brands use social media to increase their brand awareness – this makes digital skills an extremely crucial component to any brand’s marketing strategy execution.</span></p>



<p><b>What digital skill would you like to develop next?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital skill I would like to explore next is data analytics, which will assist with analyzing the effectiveness of marketing and social media campaigns.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to a mix of homegrown tech startup companies and expanding offices from established giants like Amazon and Google, urban centers from Vancouver to New York to Toronto are witnessing a boom in employment opportunities — and with it, highly skilled tech workers moving on in. But will all those workers actually stick around long-term?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One survey suggests — maybe not. A whopping three out of every four employees in the tech sector would consider moving to a new city for work, </span><a href="https://thehustle.co/tech-workers-relocate-remote-work-cost-of-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Axios research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And when workers are figuring out where to live, more than 80 percent say the cost of living is the top factor, followed by weather, commute times, and affordable housing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many desirable candidates open to moving around, cities across North America should be bracing for a tech-xodus of sorts, given the high possibility of workers looking for more affordable places to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, companies need to be extra cautious about keeping their top hires happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a big part of the attraction from an employee perspective is, am I working in a job that&#8217;s all the things I&#8217;m looking for?” says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Mullin, Executive Director of the </span><a href="https://brookfieldinstitute.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Ryerson University in Toronto.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Good pay, it&#8217;s compelling, it&#8217;s interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a high demand for tech skills, he adds, and many jobs in the industry — be it web development or graphic design or social media management — can be done remotely more often than other industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of the reason tech workers are easier to pull away, but it’s something companies and cities can combat through a variety of channels.</span></p>
<h2><b>Focus on Culture and Retraining&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways companies can boost employee retention is by focusing on improving overall corporate culture, which can mean increasing salaries and providing benefits like on-site childcare, catered meals, and social events.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to pay them more, give them better working environments&#8230; that creates a more vibrant environment and helps retain them,” Mullin says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we&#8217;ve recently written about, <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retraining, or reskilling, is an increasingly important tool for organizations,</a> and it too can have a huge impact on culture and employee retention.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a</span><a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-value-of-employee-training-and-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2017 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 70 percent of employees said that job-related training and development opportunities influenced their decision to stay at their job.&nbsp; As little as a 10 percent increase in educational development has also been shown to lead to an </span><a href="https://www.businessknowhow.com/manage/higherprod.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.6 percent gain in productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ensure Cities Are Worth Living In</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments, he adds, can also play a role in fostering the type of community skilled workers want to call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A place like Toronto and other cities like New York, the tech component of our economies is growing quite rapidly, and high-quality companies — like start-ups or scale-ups or even large companies — setting up shop&#8230; bodes well,” Mullin says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if those cities aren’t livable, quality hires can get restless and disenchanted. So, he says, civic leaders need to regularly ask a key question: Are they making their city a good place to live?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Public transit, affordability&#8230; if those things aren&#8217;t there, it doesn&#8217;t matter how good the job is,” Mullin warns. “You&#8217;ll start to lose people to places where they can get the work they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For employers, it can be worth lobbying their local government as well, to ensure decision-makers get the memo that livable cities attract top talent — which in turn boosts the economy and attracts more talent and investment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, a win-win.</span></p>
<h2><b>Adapt to a More “Fluid” Labor Market</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullin says while companies and cities need to be aware of worker preferences, and the likelihood of team members jumping ship, there’s also no cause for alarm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You might have a phenomenon where there is a shift of people out of cities, or out of big cities and into smaller cities, but the net effect is you still have people pouring into the tech sector,” he says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would take a huge, sudden shift to suddenly have the outflow increase to such an extent that it starts to have these numbers decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line? It’s natural and healthy for people to move in and out of cities, and it’s all part of a “fluid” labor market, Mullin says.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, whether companies like it or not, having workers willing to move is a good way to keep employers on their toes — so they’re always giving top hires a reason to stay.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe given the breakneck growth in the Big Apple, but New York City’s tech scene continues to boom&#8230;and its homegrown startups are playing a huge role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, New York’s startup scene has grown from $2.3 billion total invested in 2012 to more than $13 billion in 2018. According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation’s recent Global Startup Ecosystems Report, the city is now the world’s second highest performing ecosystem with 7,000 startups, 326,000 jobs, and over $71 billion in value. And Silicon Valley may now </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-new-york-is-poised-to-surpass-silicon-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be in sight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s 100 biggest local tech companies currently employ more than 38,000 people according to Built in NYC, and 80 percent of those organizations planned to expand last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a deeper look at seven startups leading the New York City tech boom. </span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Peloton</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Peloton’s swift ascension to an international sensation could make your head spin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising a world-class indoor cycling studio experience that can be accessed anywhere and fit into any schedule, Peloton sells $2,000 spinning bikes that feature a screen that streams recorded and live classes filmed in its New York studio. CEO and co-founder John Foley says the company is “weirdly profitable,” and indeed it saw its value soar to $4.15 billion after a $550 million funding round that the company said would be its last before its expected IPO this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 700 employees already based in New York, the company has plans to continue its rapid growth and has announced that it will relocate to a 312,000-square-foot space at Hudson Commons in 2020. Certainly, Peloton is committed to the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New York City is where Peloton started, and it will continue to be our home as we scale our business globally,” Foley </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-to-expand-nyc-footprint-with-new-corporate-headquarters-at-hudson-commons-in-2020-300752307.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “As our brand lives at the intersection of fitness, technology and media, this city is where the best talent can be found across all three of those industries.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.braze.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Braze</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leading customer engagement platform, Braze – formerly known as Appboy – has picked up serious steam in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the startup – which delivers personalized messaging experiences across push, email, apps and more – announced $80 million Series E funding led by Meritech Capital Partners, meaning that the company hauled in $130 million in just over a year and more than doubled its valuation to $850 million in 2017. Braze delivers tens of billions of messages to more than 1.5 billion monthly active users globally, and the startup can now boast more than 500 customers, including ABC News, AccuWeather, HBO, Lyft, and Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder CB Insights, a firm that tracks start-ups, included Braze on its 2019 list of the 50 companies worldwide on a path to a $1 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 150 of the company’s 300 employees based locally, perks include free daily lunch, medical insurance, tuition reimbursement, a flexible time-off policy and a 401(k) with employer matching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re a crew of smart, talented, hardworking individuals who are as curious as we are informed,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/06/27/nyc-companies-hiring-july-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senior Technical Recruiter Stu Levinson. “We don’t settle. Our culture encourages fresh perspectives, genuine vibes and a deep commitment to excellence.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.dataminr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Dataminr</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A real-time information discovery startup promising to transform vast public social media feeds into the earliest alerts, Dataminr helps industries including corporate security, finance, the news media, and public relations stay on top of breaking news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup officially took on unicorn status after closing a $392 million funding round in June 2018, lifting its valuation to $1.6 billion – more than double its 2015 valuation of $680 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to benefits including health insurance, 401(k) matching, free daily meals and a professional development fund, Dataminr promises its employees – who number roughly 250 locally at the company’s headquarters, located blocks from Grand Central and Penn Station – a diverse, inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When people feel comfortable being their authentic selves, they are more likely to be creative, take bigger risks and perform at higher levels,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/10/24/diversity-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Manager of Technical Recruiting Kenji Porter. “It’s more than creating an environment with people from different backgrounds – it’s also encouraging diversity of thought and empowering everyone to share ideas, participate in initiatives for positive change and make meaningful contributions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m proud to work for a company that values and includes different perspectives in everything we do.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://compass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Compass</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the mission statement of helping everyone find their place in the world, the thriving tech startup Compass aims to simplify the real-estate process – and since launching in 2012, it’s already become the country’s largest independent real-estate brokerage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just in 2018, Compass more than tripled its agent population to over 7,000 and launched in markets including Seattle, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and Dallas. The company expected to more than double its 2017 sales volume of $14.8 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not surprising that the company has ambitious plans for the future. After closing a $400 million Series F financing round in September 2018 – bringing total capital raised to nearly $1.2 billion – the company announced plans to expand internationally, while also setting the goal of gaining 20 percent market share in the top 20 U.S. cities by 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense that a company that promises to help users find their dream homes has invested in a </span><a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2018/05/31/a-look-inside-compass-new-nyc-headquarters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beautiful space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its own; its 180,000 square-foot headquarters in Union Square features cafes, collaboration zones, a game room, and a rejuvenation lounge.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.zola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Zola</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another startup chosen by CB Insights among worldwide companies looking likely for a $1 billion valuation, all-in-one wedding-planning platform Zola has couples and investors alike swooning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founded in 2013 by Shan-Lyn Ma and Nobu Nakaguchi, Zola claims to have reinvented the wedding planning experience to help the soon-to-be-betrothed do everything from create their own website, manage their registry, and stay on top of their guest lists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zola really turned heads with the May 2018 announcement that it had raised $100 million in Series D, bringing its total capital up to $140 million and, as of February 2019, helping to lift the company to a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$600 million valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Ma said the company would look to grow its share of the market – as well as the headcount of its staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are going to invest in our technology resources and product development in order to fuel innovation,” she </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/05/03/zola-100m-series-d-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We’re also going to think about mass brand awareness so everybody knows about Zola. Also, we’re hiring!”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://us.letgo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>letgo</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you think your old stuff was worthless? Think again: letgo has proven that there’s a ton of cash to be made in the second-hand marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billed as the biggest and fastest-growing app to buy and sell locally, letgo – which, surprisingly given how much money it’s raised, was only founded in 2015 – has taken the world by storm, with 100 million downloads, 400 million listings and 6 billion messages swapped by users as of </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180808005445/en/letgo-Receives-500M-New-Funding-Commitment-Naspers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was also the month letgo announced a staggering $500 million investment from Naspers and although the company isn’t disclosing valuation, that round reportedly raised it above $1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has earmarked that influx of funding for product evolution, expansion into new verticals and, of course, growth – and for job-seekers intrigued by the fast-rising company, the startup looks for people who enjoy problem-solving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look for candidates who want to build something impactful and that people love using because it makes their lives simpler,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/06/27/nyc-companies-hiring-july-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director of People Operations Natalia Harris. “We hire people who are excited by challenges rather than intimidated by them.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Glossier</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the direct-to-consumer beauty company Glossier, the future sure looks pretty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by Emily Weiss, the company now has more than 200 employees across three offices and operates in the U.S., Canada and several countries in Europe. Its annual revenue more than doubled in 2018 while landing more than 1 million new customers. A $100 million Series D funding round in March 2019 lifted its valuation to $1.2 billion and locked in its unicorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named one of the 50 most sought-after startups in the U.S. by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2018-50-most-sought-after-us-daniel-roth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Glossier also boasts a gorgeous office space – worthy of its super-popular </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/glossier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – where every conference room is named after an inspiring woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss even calls their headquarters her favorite place to be in New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are born out of an editorial site, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Into the Gloss</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and everyone here gets inspired by building creative spaces that are very out in the open,” she </span><a href="https://www.mydomaine.com/emily-weiss-glossier-office-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We have a great communal space here with sofas, so everyone can come hang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thinking behind the design of this area is making as many creative spaces as possible in a company.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Why did you decide to take this specific course?</strong></p>
<p>It seemed to offer a curriculum specific to my interest in product marketing and management that I am sure will challenge my skills and develop me as a Marketer and Product Manager.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first hear or read about the course and BrainStation?</strong></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to attend some workshops at the Toronto Campus as a delegate of the Queens University Marketing Association Conference (QMAC). The location and the venue itself were amazing.</p>
<p>I won a scholarship to BrainStation through the QMAC event. The curriculum seems to offer very specific learning material, and the instructors seem to be reputable engaging individuals.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking to achieve within the time enrolled in the course? What concept or area are you most interested in?</strong></p>
<p>As a freelancer &amp; entrepreneur, I am interested in learning more about Lean Product Development and how to develop a Minimal Viable Product.</p>
<p><strong>What gave you the push or sparked your interest to further your digital skills and education overall?</strong></p>
<p>Being so early in my career, I want to equip myself with experiences and a deeper understanding of marketing as a whole to give myself an advantage over my peers upon graduation from university. I believe my time at BrainStation will set myself up for success in the long term by expanding my marketing acumen.</p>
