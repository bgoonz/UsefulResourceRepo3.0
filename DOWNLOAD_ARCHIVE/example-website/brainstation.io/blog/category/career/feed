								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It goes without saying that the spread of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on employment, hiring trends, and the world of work in general. While the current “new normal” has been a shrinkage in the workforce, startups in Vancouver’s hot tech market are still growing and hiring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are three great Vancouver tech startups that are hiring right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://lumen5.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Lumen5</a></h2>



<p>Lumen5 combines artificial intelligence and machine learning in a platform that can turn text into engaging video content in minutes&nbsp; –&nbsp;with no training. Launched in 2017, Lumen5 recently won New Ventures BC and was recognized for being one of the fastest-growing startups in the province, with over 400,000 users across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company is currently hiring a Front-End Engineer and a Javascript Engineer, but the company also has an open call page, and they encourage ambitious, talented individuals to apply, anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company shares that they are always looking for self-starters with an entrepreneurial spirit. If that sounds like you, or if you want to know more about the culture and available roles at Lumen5, visit their <a href="https://lumen5.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">careers page here</a>.</p>



<h2><a href="http://freshprep.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Fresh Prep</a></h2>



<p>Fresh Prep is a meal kit delivery service that provides pre-portioned, pre-chopped ingredients in reusable cooler bags, and recyclable or compostable packaging options. Launched in 2015, Fresh Prep has grown its customer base by over 200 percent year over year and now has over 250 employees.</p>

<h2><a href="https://vessifootwear.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vessi</a></h2>



<p>Vessi is a shoe company like no other. Founded by Mikaella Go and Tony Yu through a Kickstarter project (their campaign attracted more than nine thousand backers and 1.2 million dollars pledged), the company has a patented fabric technology, which was designed to withstand Vancouver’s wet, rainy weather –&nbsp;and stay stylish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Totally vegan and sustainably made, the waterproof shoe “functions like a boot, fits like a sock, but looks like a sneaker.” This mix seems to be hit; pre-orders were halted to keep up with the overwhelming demand. Now the company is hiring to continue its growth; Vessi is looking for talented individuals in administration and HR, customer success, and marketing, Find out more about the company and their available roles at the <a href="https://vessifootwear.ca/pages/careers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vessi careers page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

I also hold a certificate in Media &amp; Communication Fundamentals from Seneca College, and recently completed a Marketing certificate at George Brown College in addition to the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/social-media-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Marketing Certificate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from BrainStation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of my career, I’ve been working at TELUS for 11 years – I started in 2008 where I was hired as a Sales Representative selling cell phones and plans in my local mall, and did that for over 5 years to financially put myself through University. In my last semester of University, I was required to do an internship, which I completed on the Marketing Communications team that I’m still on today. I’ve grown from an Intern, to a Specialist, to a Manager, to a Senior Manager within 5 years. I’ve definitely had the authentic “climbing the corporate ladder” experience.</span></p>
<p><b>What does your day-to-day look like as the Senior Marketing Communications Manager, CRM at TELUS?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two days are the same within my role, and that’s how I like it! Depending on the day I could be spending hours in back-to-back in-person meetings at the TELUS office, on conference calls at home, sifting through emails on the train, or writing briefs out of the Marketing agency – it really depends. I’m very grateful for the flexible work style that my team is offered as it allows me to do my best work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I specialize in crafting marketing communications for TELUS’ existing customer base and work closely with our main Marketing agency, The Greenhouse, throughout the creative direction and development process. At any given time, I manage up to 20 integrated marketing campaigns simultaneously from briefing, to execution, to post-mortem for my respective portfolios.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the core elements and channels of your digital marketing strategy at TELUS?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core channels I leverage for the marketing campaigns I manage targeting TELUS’ existing customer base are Facebook, Instagram, IAB (Interactive Ad Banners), and GSP (Google Sponsored Promotions).</span></p>
<p><b>You’ve worked on the Marketing Communications team at TELUS for more than five years, how have you seen the strategy or marketing efforts change with the rise of digital technology?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I started as an Intern in 2014, TELUS’ marketing communications strategy has changed significantly. Back then, it was common for my team to create physical addressed mail pieces promoting TELUS’ products and services, and send them directly to customers – I remember spending hours learning about different types of paper stocks and finishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, my team has shifted our efforts to primarily digital-focused campaigns, and that’s allowed us to meet and exceed our engagement and conversion expectations. We’ve tested, failed fast, and innovated to remain competitive within the space and ensure we’re delivering the right message, to the right person, at the right time, in the right medium.</span></p>
<p><b>What role has professional development and learning played throughout your career journey so far?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional development and learning has played a pivotal role throughout my career journey, and I’m a passionate lifelong learner that’s dedicated to being enrolled in at least 1 course per year. TELUS is an organization that’s incredibly supportive of team members’ professional development and success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I used a combination of in-store sales experience and self-taught marketing knowledge to get my foot in the door in the field, consistently and intentionally keeping my skills up-to-date with courses and bootcamps completed outside of my day job has undoubtedly contributed to my growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as I’ve spent my entire career thus far working within the same company, it’s important for me to learn from industry professionals in different fields to gain different perspectives and expose myself to new ways of problem solving. I’ve been taught by professors who work in everything from finance, to CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods), to e-commerce, to boutique marketing agencies and everything in between – and it’s truly helped diversify the way I develop creative solutions within my role.</span></p>
<p><b>You have an extensive background in marketing and communications, and you’re no stranger to the marketing world, so what drove you to take the BrainStation Social Media Marketing Course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TELUS is a very large organization that has many different teams with various specializations. My team, which specializes in overall Customer Communications, collaborates with the highly skilled Digital and Social Media Marketing team to ensure we’re delivering quality communications to our existing customer base. I believe that in order to have the best possible outcomes in this collaborative effort, it’s imperative for me to have a thorough understanding of the foundation of the digital and social media marketing world, to be able to provide them with the tools they need to help facilitate a successful campaign. I took the BrainStation course to be able to play my part in ensuring our teams are developing quality, engaging campaigns as efficiently as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I started doing my research for what organization to take a Social Media Marketing course at, BrainStation was recommended on numerous occasions through word of mouth, online searches, and within the tech community.</span></p>
<p><b>In addition to your roles at TELUS, you were the Co-founder and Host of a successful podcast that recently wrapped up, and are now working on a new solo project called Liberty Leave. Can you tell us more about these?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damsel in the 6ix was a podcast I co-hosted that encouraged women to effortlessly slay life and focused on career navigation, self-development, and dating in Toronto. It was featured on BlogTO’s “Top Toronto Podcasts You Should Be Listening To” article, and included podcast guests from companies like Bumble, Plan International Canada, NKPR, and more. After over 12K listens and 62 episodes, my co-host and I have officially closed the chapter and are exploring new opportunities after an incredibly fulfilling experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new project I’m currently working on is called Liberty Leave and will focus on inspiring people who are making purposeful pivots in life and have left behind what doesn’t bring them liberty, for what does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s important for people to develop their own identity that doesn’t solely stand on the legs of their day job. Whether that’s just a strong personal brand, or it also includes a side project that allows you to let your creativity flow and work with brands you may not have the opportunity to in your day job – growing your career and presence doesn’t solely need to be done within the company you work for full-time. </span></p>
<p><b>How are you applying the skills you learned in the Social Media Marketing course to your professional role at TELUS or to your side project?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skills I learned in the Social Media Marketing course have helped me better understand targeting practices and user personas, pinpointing what verbiage has the highest likelihood to resonate with my audience, what layouts and formats drive the most engagement, what platforms tend to have the highest conversion rates for different demographics, and much more that I’m applying to my role at TELUS today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Liberty Leave, I have the opportunity to completely build a brand from scratch, and I’m excited to utilize the skills I learned in the course to create a presence on social. In this day and age, it’s imperative to have a strong social media presence for a company to grow, and I can’t wait to reference my pages and pages of notes from class to build out an acquisition strategy to support my growth stage.</span></p>
<p><b>What was your favourite part of your BrainStation experience?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favourite part about my BrainStation experience was interacting with the community. I had some incredibly bright and ambitious classmates, and it was so inspiring to see how they were utilizing their knowledge from the Social Media Marketing course to help drive results for either an organization they work for, or for an existing or upcoming business they were passionate about developing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also had a great professor that I found very relatable, and she really helped me shape my understanding of where and how to spend on Digital Marketing channels depending on what your desired outcome is, and illustrated her recommendations with real-life examples and commentary.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/perfecting-the-pivot-what-you-need-to-know-before-changing-careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jump into a new career</a> can be an overwhelming and complex decision, but switching career paths is becoming more commonplace as demand for digital roles continues to skyrocket. Taking part in a program or bootcamp that will prepare you with the skills necessary for your career transformation can be integral to finding success. </span></p>
<p>To help you through the decision-making process, BrianStation invited diploma program graduates to talk about how they made the switch to their desired career.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a recap of what they shared about their experience in the program and finding a job in a new industry. </span></p>
<h2><b>Diverse Career Backgrounds</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panelists came from a range of career and education backgrounds, and there was at least one alum from each of BrainStation’s diploma programs – <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/data-science-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Science</a>, <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/user-experience-immersive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Experience (UX) Design</a>, and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/web-development-immersive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Development</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aline Santoso, for instance, was working as a Biomedical Engineer at UBC prior to applying to BrainStation’s Data Science Diploma Program and is now a Data Scientist at Teligence Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My background is in engineering, and I had a lot of data that I didn’t know how to deal with,” said Santoso. “I think that was the first time that I started thinking I need to do this more efficiently, and that’s when I started searching for programming, and then stumbled upon data science. When BrainStation launched the Data Science program, I took it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikhila Kakarlapudi moved from London to take the UX Design program, and is now working as a Product Designer and Manager at LivNao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My background is in tech consulting, so I was quite fortunate that I had experience across the design lifecycle so to speak. All the way from strategy to designing and launching tech products. The area I was most interested in was the design side of things so I really wanted to dig in and get more tangible skills in that area,” explained Kakarlapudi. “Around the same time I was thinking of moving out of London, I was researching different courses that were available and came across the UX Design program at BrainStation.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Deciding on BrainStation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing all the alumni have in common – they did their research before deciding on BrainStation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Bruna Garcia, a Web Development diploma graduate, she weighed many factors before finally applying to the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were three things that drew me to BrainStation. First of all, I did a bit of research about the technologies that the programs use, and BrainStation focused some curriculum on React and open source programming languages which I wanted to learn more about,” said Garcia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also, I really like the environment here, people are friendly, people are nice. And then there’s the financial part, having the opportunity to have a payment plan really helped as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others were more focused on the fact that a 12-week diploma program meant they could be starting their new career sooner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was considering Data Science for a while, and UBC at that time launched a Data Science program, but it’s 16 months, and BrainStation was only 12 weeks,” said Santoso. “I think that was a major decision point for me; three months versus 16 months, and I could get a job after that.”</span></p>
<h2><b>The Learning Experience</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People interested in diploma programs often ask questions about the learning experience. What does it really mean to be in an immersive program? Is it the same as university? How do you learn so much in 12 weeks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the BrainStation alumni spoke to that on the panel, explaining what a typical day looks like and how the programs differed from traditional education they had experienced in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I graduated [from university] in October and came to BrainStation in January – and it’s like night and day,” explained Nick Abasolo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick studied Economics in his undergraduate degree before taking BrainStation’s UX Design Diploma Program and now works as a Product Designer at Dialpad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In college or university you show up to class sometimes, and listen sometimes, but at BrainStation, you’re learning practical skills from people who do that job,” said Abasolo. “It’s not Professors who study the subject as a theory, it’s Designers, or Developers, or Data Scientists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diploma programs are a collaborative, project-based environment, meaning that students are applying they skills they learn every day to complete real-world projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first time I came to BrainStation I was expecting more of a traditional teaching style and I was pleasantly surprised that it was more like working in a team,” said Santoso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s definitely a fully immersive experience,” said Kakarlapudi. “It’s really collaborative, and I liked the classroom style where you have lectures in the morning and then work on the Capstone projects in the afternoon. And you have the contact with the Educators, so if you have questions, they are really open to giving feedback and providing help.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Finding a Job After a Diploma Program</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panelists all highlighted the intensity of the program, and emphasized that it’s an environment where hard work really </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pays off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three diploma programs culminate with Demo Day, BrainStation’s graduate project </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/brainstation-graduate-student-showcase-capstone-projects"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showcase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is an opportunity for students to present their Capstone project to Hiring Partners, industry professionals, and the BrainStation community. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students also benefit from the Career Success Program, which supports them on their job search with mock interviews, resume and interview preparation, and personal branding guidance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a mock interview just before our Demo Day and I prepared a ten-slide presentation, and maybe on the second slide [the interviewer] said ‘let’s just jump into your sketch file’ – I was completely unprepared for it as it was my first experience having that style of an interview,” said Kakarlapudi. “It was so helpful having that input and noting the things that he’d question me on. Having the opportunity to have that real time feedback was useful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the diploma programs there are opportunities to attend tech tours and workshops with professionals from various industry-leading organizations – really valuable experiences when you’re looking for a new job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During my time at BrainStation we had a lot of workshops with different people and companies in the industry, and at that time one of the people I met worked for Unbounce,” said Garcia. “When my TA position at BrainStation was coming to an end, she actually contacted me and offered me a position.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changing careers is hard, but the BrainStation alumni are proof that with the right skills and support, it’s definitely possible. </span></p>
