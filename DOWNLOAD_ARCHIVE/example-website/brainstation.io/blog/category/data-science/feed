								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This last month, graduates had the opportunity to participate in our first stay-at-home hackathon (in partnership with Microsoft).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each team had three days to design a solution for a better work-from-home experience that could integrate with the Microsoft Teams video chat software. After a few intense days of work and collaboration, the judges were seriously impressed with the results.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-1024x536.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11935" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-768x402.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-1536x804.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-2048x1072.jpg 2048w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-960x502.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We spoke with the winning team: Pablo Lopez Castillo (UX Design), Jung Oh (UX Design), Ali Eddeb (Data Science), and Nick Mahon (Data Science). Together, the alumni designed FocusBuddy, a productivity app to help you stay focused on your tasks.</p>



<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>Having recently completed their full-time diploma programs at BrainStation, the graduates were eager to test their new skills with a challenge from a tech giant like Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By participating in this hackathon, my hope was that I would be exposed to the types of challenges or projects Microsoft employees get to tackle, as well as how they solve them,” Oh said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For their project, the winning team wanted to reflect the current conditions professionals face when working from home. “We found that productivity was a primary issue remote workers face due to a variety of reasons. One of the most prominent pain points users had with productivity was that they had trouble maintaining self-discipline when attempting to thwart distractions (such as a cell phone),” the team explained.</p>



<p>The team decided to focus on developing a Microsoft Teams add-on called FocusBuddy, which helps boost remote productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FocusBuddy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Identifies user work habits and suggests on how to improve them with computer vision</li><li>Sends reminders and recommendations throughout a session to increase productivity and wellness&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Awards points for uninterrupted work and healthy habits</li><li>&nbsp;Allows daily team goal-setting with leader boards and results&nbsp;</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-1024x634.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11937" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-1024x634.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-300x186.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-768x476.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-1536x951.png 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-2048x1269.png 2048w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1-960x595.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131457/Screen-Shot-2020-05-08-at-10.45.17-AM-1.png 2302w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Working Together</h2>



<p>Working remotely, the team used a plethora of tools to iterate, create, collaborate, and test. The Designers relied on Sketch, Figma, and Invision, while the Data Scientists used Sublime Text 3, Anaconda Prompt, and Jupyter Notebooks. Of course, Microsoft Teams also supported communication and collaboration to keep them working together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Seeing our concept come to life within the time constraints was satisfying as we all had pivotal roles,” Castillo said, explaining that there were many proud moments amongst the team.&nbsp;As a bonus, the team created a product <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFr-fAFbb8u6iAJivQWQgxv3bm4342Wk/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">commercial</a> which really tied the whole presentation together. </p>



<p>Eddeb for one was impressed by the team dynamics. “We were able to criticize our ideas well and did not fall into groupthink. We were able to delegate tasks effectively and we overall had a good time working together.”</p>



<p>Similarly, Oh enjoyed working with Data Scientists to leverage unique solutions. “We were able to ask our Data Scientists to provide thought-provoking perspectives, educate ourselves regarding the possibilities of data, and implement innovative solutions as a result.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mahon, meanwhile, was pleased with the way the UX team brought their ideas into reality. “Bringing such a polished look to an otherwise rough idea was incredible.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-1024x536.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11938" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-1024x536.jpeg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-300x157.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-768x402.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-960x502.jpeg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But it wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting the project, in particular, posed a challenge. “There were just so many ways to approach the improvement of the work-from-home experience,” the team said. “We spent a significant amount of time redefining our problem space to achieve what we felt to be the best solution.”</p>



<p>As they moved forward, the team relied on what they learned at BrainStation to find success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From the plethora of knowledge gained in completing the Data Science program at BrainStation, the most relevant of it was learned during 3D day,” Mahon said. BrainStation 3D is a day in which students from the UX, Data, and Web Dev platforms come together for a day-long collaborative competition to practice working cross-functionally. “Working with UX Designers beforehand and having an idea of how our work complements one another went a long way in arriving at our final product,” said Mahon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The others agreed that BrainStation gave them the tools to work well as a multidisciplinary group. Plablo shared that the program taught him skills that helped him with “navigating the problem space and understanding how to extract insights and translating research to identify user needs is a skill I am always working to improve on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh agreed that the diploma program taught them how to approach problems in a team setting. “This skill was useful in the hackathon because it enabled our team to get all of our ideas on the table, use our individual strengths and knowledge to analyze and select an idea to move work with, and apply the technical skills we have been trained in.”</p>



<h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>



<p>The team encourages other recent graduates and others seeking a role in UX or Data to practice, practice, practice. Edebb says the best advice he’s received is to continue working on projects. “Once you have foundational knowledge, try to implement what you have learned by working on projects.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, Mahon reminds us:<em> </em>“The slogan that is heard throughout our time at BrainStation is based on being ‘a lifetime learner.’ My advice is to do exactly that; there is never nothing new to learn and the more you know, the more directions you will be able to take your career.”<br></p>

<p>Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, hundreds of BrainStation students recently graduated with Diplomas in UX Design, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Web Development (opens in a new tab)" href="https://brainstation.io/blog/graduate-showcase-winter-2020" target="_blank">Web Development</a>, and Data Science. We couldn&#8217;t be prouder of their achievements and the way they took everything in stride.</p>



<p>BrainStation’s full-time Diploma programs culminate with students producing an individual portfolio piece for their final Capstone project.</p>



<p>Here are some of our favorite Data Science projects from Winter 2020. You can also see all of our graduate&#8217;s projects on our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="hiring page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://brainstation.io/hiring-brainstation-graduates" target="_blank">hiring page</a>. </p>



<h2>RoadBoost: Intelligent Traffic Light Control System</h2>



<h3><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Daria Aza (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariaaza/" target="_blank">Daria Aza</a></h3>



<p>The satisfying video below speaks for itself. See how Daria was able to improve traffic flow using Deep reinforcement learning to regulate traffic lights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to create an environment with vehicles and pedestrians, Daria’s goal was to teach traffic lights to react to situations in real-time and adjust lights accordingly. The negative cumulative reward was calculated based on the number of vehicles and pedestrians stopped at the intersection. After every action, the reward was recalculated, eventually decreasing the delay to such an extent that most vehicles and pedestrians were able to move through without waiting. </p>

<h2>Radiomics: Associating tumor features with survival outcome</h2>



<h3>(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hervé (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/herve-choi/" target="_blank">Hervé</a>) Hiu Fai Choi</h3>



<p>Hervé’s project aims to associate lung cancer tumor features with the survival outcome of the patient. Observing characteristics of the tumor, such as how big, irregular, lumpy, or coarse the tumor is, may influence the treatment the patient chooses to undergo or the clinician chooses to administer. </p>

<h2>Use of NLP and Supervised Learning to Target Wine Scores</h2>



<h3><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Aviel Stern (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avielstern/" target="_blank">Aviel Stern</a></h3>



<p>Aviel created a predictive model for wine scores by looking at geography, price, description, variety, and vintage. This algorithm provides valuable consumer insights to wine sellers curating selections and consumers looking for trendy flavors.</p>



<p>Her work found that logistic regression performed the best with a 80 percent accuracy score in predicting how well wine would be rated. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation held its first online panel discussion yesterday –&nbsp;Entitled <em>Data Literacy: The New Essential Skill</em> –&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the event attracted thousands of professionals from the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>Ian Bester, BrainStation&#8217;s Vice-President and GM, hosted the event, which&nbsp;featured Nada Salem from Spotify and Thomas Levi Unbounce.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panelists touched on a number of topics, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The origin of the data skills gap</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring for data literacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to develop employees with cross-functional abilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promoting a data-first culture at your organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of upskilling and continuous learning in data literacy</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering advice to professionals interested in data, Nada Salem discussed how educational backgrounds were becoming less important in the hiring process, particularly when it came to data roles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I work with so many people who don&#8217;t have professional training; many are successful taking online courses and using resources such as BrainStation. I&#8217;ve seen so many individuals transition to data roles based just on online courses,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panelists also discussed the importance of basic data skills throughout an organization. Levi, in fact, suggested that all professionals should now have basic data skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Learn to embrace uncertainty and probabilities &#8211; learn basic statistics, learn what things don&#8217;t tell you. What is it not able to tell me? How can I use this to inform my questions? Having the ability to ask good questions will really help your decision making and communication with your companies’ data team,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://colin-fraser.net/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Fraser</a>, a Data Scientist at Facebook (and a former Lead Educator at BrainStation) has recently publish a dashboard that tracks the growth of COVID-19 across Canadian provinces.&nbsp;The data comes from the&nbsp;Johns Hopkins COVID-19 resource center, which they’ve shared publicly in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">this GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>While Fraser cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information with the rapid progression of the virus, the data should be consistent with the Johns Hopkins dashboard.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve explored in the past, the need for data professionals is soaring and trending only upward, with an expected 28 percent rise in demand over the next two years and a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2.7 million new jobs.

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, those in the industry are seeing a larger and larger focus on machine learning. BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that machine learning was the trend most likely to have an impact on the work of data professionals, with 80 percent of data respondents singling it out as the top difference-maker in the coming five-to-10 years. And Google Trends shows that its popularity as a search term has grown roughly 200 percent over the last three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, what’s the difference between data science and machine learning? We took a closer look.</span></p>
<h2><b>Machine Learning</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply, machine learning – or the process of a computer learning how to better perform a task as it gains more experience doing so – uses&nbsp;algorithms to make predictions and find patterns. Machine learning spans a wide array of ideas, tools, and techniques used by Data Scientists and other professionals, and it’s one of the most popular methods for processing big amounts of raw data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be easiest to view machine learning as a part of data science. Machine learning frees Data Scientists from the tedious task of sifting through massive volumes of data by using complex algorithms and problem-solving methods including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of machine learning are all around you. Facebook, for instance, uses machine learning to analyze your past behavior to present content and notifications in line with your interests. Similarly, when Netflix somehow recommends a show you’d love to binge-watch, it’s an example of machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the simplest example of machine learning in motion lies in how it approaches the task of recognizing handwriting. To train a machine with examples of correct input-output pairs – which is called supervised machine learning – the computer is shown images of handwritten numbers alongside the correct labels for those digits. The computer then tries to figure out the shared characteristics of each digit, and gradually picks up on the patterns between the images and the labels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, machine learning is effective to solve problems that are statistical or probabilistic in nature, deeply complex, and that can be adequately handled with an approximate solution. For instance, the issue of detecting credit card fraud checks those boxes: solutions are probabilistic because a determination won’t be made until a company reaches its customer; the rules around fraud are complex; and approximate solutions are adequate since we’re simply flagging transactions for further review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many of the more advanced machine learning tools do require some experience and knowhow, the basics can still be impactful for those looking to dig deeper. Many supervised and unsupervised learning models are implemented in R and Python, and straightforward models like linear or logistic regression can be used to perform informative machine-learning tasks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Data Science</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science uses technology and math to find otherwise invisible patterns in raw data to help us make predictions and better-informed decisions. As more and more data is generated and collected by companies, data science is the key to finding otherwise hidden insights that can have a transformative effect on factors including consumer behavior, operational issues, marketing opportunities, supply-chain cycles, and predictive analyses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Data Scientist spends significant time collecting, extracting, cleaning, modeling and analyzing data before using an array of techniques to come to meaningful conclusions, including predictive causal analytics (or predicting the possibilities of an event in the future), prescriptive analytics (conjuring a range of actions and the related outcomes) and, yes, machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might sound as though Data Scientists spend their days buried in numbers, but that isn’t the case. BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey found that Data Scientists primarily work on developing new ideas, products, and services, as opposed to optimizing existing platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while a majority of respondents (73 percent) indicated that they work with numerical data, 61 percent said they also work with text, 44 percent with structured data, 13 percent with images, and 12 percent with graphics. Some even work with video and audio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all cases, however, the goal of data science is to leverage data to help a company make better decisions. And given the sheer volume of data being generated and now analyzed, data science is a field that has never been more important.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company decides to make the leap into data science, and has hired their first Data Scientist. She shows up and her boss hands her a laptop and tells her to get to work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the company is lucky, they’ve snagged an enterprising Data Scientist who can figure out a way to make an impact. Odds are though, it will lead to an expensive Data Scientist sitting around, frustratedly wishing they had something to work on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can you do to avoid this increasingly common situation? Here are some things you should do before hiring a Data Scientist. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a Realistic Data Roadmap</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard how revolutionary data, AI and machine learning are going to be, so once you hire your first Data Scientist, they ought to have no trouble ushering your organization into the future. Right? Not exactly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientists are equipped with in-depth knowledge of statistics, machine learning, and big data technologies&#8230;but they most likely don’t know your industry. This means that your Data Scientist will spend a significant amount of time learning your business and figuring out how to apply their knowledge and expertise to your domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can help this process significantly by having a general understanding of what can and can’t be accomplished with data science – even if you don’t have a full understanding of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Data Scientists do what they do. By having some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ideas about how the Data Scientist could impact your business, you will minimize that lag between your first hire and your first data-driven business decisions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand What Data Scientists Can Do</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data science” is broad, and Data Scientists can do a lot, but contemporary understanding of this is centered around </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">machine learning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is fundamentally about making accurate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">predictions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a side note, in machine learning, we use the term “predict” quite broadly—in every-day speak, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">predictions </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are about the future, but in machine learning, predicting is the much more general filling in of data that we don’t have. So you may have a machine learning algorithm that “predicts” what segment a customer belongs to based on their activities and interactions with your company. This prediction isn’t really about the future per se, but we call it a “prediction” because you are using data that you have to fill in data that you don’t have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning predictions involve taking data that you have and using it to predict the values of data that you don’t have. Truly understanding this idea is half the battle. To pose a machine learning problem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you begin by identifying some outcome that you want to predict. You might go on to theorize some events or data points that you think would be instrumental in predicting that outcome. Generally these predictive data points are called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">features</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The machine learning approach is then to get as many historical examples as you can of the outcome that you’re trying to predict, along with the features that you’ve chosen, and have the computer analyze the historical examples to find patterns linking the features to the outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By understanding the outline of this process, you can empower your newly hired Data Scientist to do effective work much more quickly and easily. Moreover, if there is a strong understanding of what can be produced (and what is needed to produce it), you and and the business as a whole will be better positioned to use the Data Scientist’s work.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand What Can Go Wrong</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider two competing telecom companies, BigTel and CoolTec. Neither has had a Data Scientist working in the marketing department before, but managers at both have read about how data science is the future and have decided to hire one. Each has a focus on improving customer retention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manager at BigTel brings the Data Scientist on, hands her a laptop, and tells her to start using data science to help customer retention. The newly hired Data Scientist at BigTel begins feeling around, getting her hands on whatever data she can find, analyzing different measures of customer churn and retention, trying to come up with a useful way to apply the skills that she brings to the problem of reducing retention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She spends a few months producing impressive and informative reports and powerpoint presentations, interviewing people across the business to better understand customer retention, and brainstorming ways to impact retention. Unfortunately, it’s not clear how to make use of these facts, figures, and ideas to fundamentally affect changes in customer retention. Many months go by and it begins to look like the return on investment in data science isn’t as great as it was cracked up to be. Everyone is sad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CoolTec, the hiring manager has read this article and spent some time contemplating how to use machine learning to help with retention – before even making the first hire. By the time the Data Scientist is hired, there is already a plan: the Data Scientist at CoolTec will create a machine learning model that predicts which customers are likely to churn in the next three months. The model will make these predictions based on customer interactions, historical billing patterns, and geography. That model will be used to generate call lists for retention agents, who will contact the high-risk customers with special offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CoolTec, the Data Scientist can get started doing what she’s good at right out of the gate. When the problem is posed in the language of machine learning—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a model to predict which customers are likely to churn—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Data Scientist’s education and training will be put to its best use. And while they are building this model, managers at CoolTec can make arrangements with the rest of the business for how to consume and deal with the predictions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to know everything about machine learning to hire a Data Scientist— after all, that’s what you’re hiring the Data Scientist to do. But it is useful to understand the general principles of machine learning, and how to use that process to produce positive business outcomes. The Data Scientist’s specialty is in creating predictive models, not in creating positive business outcomes. As a manager, if you can handle the translation from a business question to a machine learning question, the Data Scientist can hit the ground running, producing things that can be truly transformative.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the skyrocketing demand for Data Scientists and the reasons the field is growing at such a rapid rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in the technical skills required by the field, read on for the top programming languages for Data Science.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Python</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a manageable learning curve and an array of libraries that allow for near-endless applications, Python is the top programming language of choice for many Data Scientists who appreciate its accessibility, ease of use and general-purpose versatility. In fact, BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that Python was the most frequently used tool for Data Scientists overall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since being introduced in 1991, Python has built up a growing number of dedicated libraries to carry out tasks including data preprocessing, analysis, predictions, visualization, and preservation. Meanwhile, Python libraries including Tensorflow, pandas, and scikit-learn allow for more advanced machine learning or deep learning applications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientists also tend to find Python to be generally faster than R and better for data manipulation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You can find out more about this language with BrainStation&#8217;s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_ProgrammingLanguagesforDataScience">Python Programming Course</a>.</p>
<h2><b>R</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A free, open-source programming language that was released in 1995 as a descendant of the S programming language, R offers a top-notch range of quality domain-specific packages to meet nearly every statistical and data visualization application a Data Scientist might need, including neural networks, non-linear regression, advanced plotting and much more. Its visualization library ggplot2 is a powerful tool, and R’s static graphics can make it easier to produce graphs and mathematical symbols and formulae.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Python does have a speed advantage over the slower R, but for specific statistical and data analysis purposes, R’s vast range of packages gives it a slight edge between the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth noting that R isn’t a general-purpose programming language and is intended to be used specifically for statistical analysis. And R does feature a steeper learning curve than the approachable Python.</span></p>
<h2><b>SQL</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing for “Structured Query Language,” SQL has been at the core of storing and retrieving data for decades now. SQL is a domain-specific language for managing data in relational databases and it’s a must-have skill for Data Scientists, who rely on SQL for updating, querying, editing and manipulating databases and extracting data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL is particularly helpful for managing structured data, especially within large databases. And since SQL is a core skill, it’s helpful that its declarative language is quite readable and intuitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though SQL is not as useful as an analytical tool, it is a highly efficient and crucial tool for data retrieval.</span></p>

</div>
<h2><b>Java</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the oldest general-purpose languages used by Data Scientists, Java’s strength lies in part in its popularity and ubiquity: many companies, especially big, international companies, used Java to create backend systems and applications for desktop, mobile or web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java skills are increasingly attractive in part because of the possibility of weaving data science production code directly into an existing database. It’s also highly regarded for its performance, type safety and portability between platforms. And it’s worth noting that Hadoop runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM), another reason Java is a must-have skill for Data Scientists.</span></p>
<h2><b>Scala</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly and flexible, Scala is the ideal programming language when dealing with great volumes of data. Combining object-oriented and functional programming, Scala avoids bugs in complex applications with its static types, facilitates large-scale parallel processing, and, when paired with Apache Spark, provides high-performance cluster computing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineered to run on the JVM, anything written on Scala can run anywhere that Java runs. It is becoming especially popular for anyone building complex algorithms or performing large-scale machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scala does feature a steeper learning curve than some programming languages, but its massive user base is a testament to the value in sticking with it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Julia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A much newer programming language than others on this list, Julia has nevertheless made a fast impression thanks to its lightning-fast performance, simplicity, and readability. Designed for numerical analysis and computational science, Julia is especially useful for solving complex mathematical operations, which explains why it’s becoming a fixture in the financial industry. It’s also becoming widely known as a language for artificial intelligence, and many large banks are now using Julia for risk analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the language is relatively young, Julia does lack the variety of packages offered by R or Python.</span></p>
<h2><b>MATLAB</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used widely in statistical analysis, this proprietary numerical computing language will be helpful for Data Scientists dealing with high-level mathematical needs, including Fourier transforms, signal processing, image processing, and matrix algebra. MATLAB has become widely used in industry and academia for its intensive mathematical functionality. It’s also worth mentioning its value as a data visualization tool, as it features some great inbuilt plotting capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB can also help cut down on time spent preprocessing data and help you find the best machine-learning models, regardless of your level of expertise.</span></p>
