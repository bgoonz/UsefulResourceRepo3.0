								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It goes without saying that the spread of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on employment, hiring trends, and the world of work in general. While the current “new normal” has been a shrinkage in the workforce, startups in Vancouver’s hot tech market are still growing and hiring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are three great Vancouver tech startups that are hiring right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://lumen5.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Lumen5</a></h2>



<p>Lumen5 combines artificial intelligence and machine learning in a platform that can turn text into engaging video content in minutes&nbsp; –&nbsp;with no training. Launched in 2017, Lumen5 recently won New Ventures BC and was recognized for being one of the fastest-growing startups in the province, with over 400,000 users across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company is currently hiring a Front-End Engineer and a Javascript Engineer, but the company also has an open call page, and they encourage ambitious, talented individuals to apply, anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company shares that they are always looking for self-starters with an entrepreneurial spirit. If that sounds like you, or if you want to know more about the culture and available roles at Lumen5, visit their <a href="https://lumen5.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">careers page here</a>.</p>



<h2><a href="http://freshprep.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Fresh Prep</a></h2>



<p>Fresh Prep is a meal kit delivery service that provides pre-portioned, pre-chopped ingredients in reusable cooler bags, and recyclable or compostable packaging options. Launched in 2015, Fresh Prep has grown its customer base by over 200 percent year over year and now has over 250 employees.</p>



<p>The company is looking to hire nearly a dozen positions in the next couple of months to help meet increased demand, including development, marketing, and production roles. The company boasts competitive pay, career growth opportunities, oh, and free food! A full list of available roles can be found <a href="https://canr57.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/freshprep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">at the Fresh Prep career</a> portal.</p>



<h2><a href="https://vessifootwear.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vessi</a></h2>



<p>Vessi is a shoe company like no other. Founded by Mikaella Go and Tony Yu through a Kickstarter project (their campaign attracted more than nine thousand backers and 1.2 million dollars pledged), the company has a patented fabric technology, which was designed to withstand Vancouver’s wet, rainy weather –&nbsp;and stay stylish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Totally vegan and sustainably made, the waterproof shoe “functions like a boot, fits like a sock, but looks like a sneaker.” This mix seems to be hit; pre-orders were halted to keep up with the overwhelming demand. Now the company is hiring to continue its growth; Vessi is looking for talented individuals in administration and HR, customer success, and marketing, Find out more about the company and their available roles at the <a href="https://vessifootwear.ca/pages/careers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Vessi careers page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spocket has over 10 different positions currently open, including development, product management, marketing, and customer experience roles, with more to come in the weeks ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>*by</em> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrious, the largest premium workplace provider in the country.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many people staying at home, online learning has become the norm — at a time when rates were already high. In 2017, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">77 percent of American companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented some form of online learning, with 98 percent planning to do so this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re taking advantage of the time at home to develop professionally or personally, online learning has a number of benefits. It’s more convenient and less time-intensive than in-person courses. And it can have significant results: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/are-online-courses-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a recent survey of 1,000 online students, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">91 percent said it improved their professional lives and 93 percent, their resume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to get the most out of your studies, you need a setup that will help you focus. As a flexible workplace provider, part of our mission at </span><a href="https://www.industriousoffice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to design spaces that actively </span><a href="https://www.industriousoffice.com/blog/thrive-at-work/four-ways-to-hack-your-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encourage productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the office, that means anything from having different rooms optimized for different kinds of work modes to creating a beautiful environment that members are excited to spend time in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how to translate some of the lessons we use every day in our offices to your home study space.</span></p>
<h3><b>Identify the Right Study Spot</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the urge to plop yourself down on the couch with your laptop when you need to focus. Your work — and your work-life balance — will improve if you take the time to designate a specific area for your studies. Otherwise, it’s all too easy to get distracted when you’re trying to concentrate. The opposite is also true; it can be harder to switch out of study mode when you’re working in the exact same spot you watch TV in. Especially if you’re a troubled sleeper, you should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid working in your bedroom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">even leaving your study materials there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want a calm place where you study in peace. But what if the bedroom or living room is your only option? You can create visual distance between your studies and your home life by positioning your desk or table so that it’s removed from the sightline of your couch or bed and vice versa. For example, face a window overlooking a quiet street. Or, put up a barrier like a curtain, screen, or even a bookshelf.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pay Attention to Your Comfort</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first sit down, you might not even notice that your setup is uncomfortable. But if you give it time, you could start experiencing lower back or neck pain. Don’t let it get to that point — make adjustments with items you already have and by making small investments in equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top of your monitor should be at about eye level. To achieve this, you could purchase in a laptop stand, or use books to raise your screen. Then, get a second keyboard so that you can rest your hands at or even a bit below a 90-degree angle. Your monitor should be positioned directly in front of you — to prevent twisting — and at about an arm’s length distance away. This will prevent you from overextending or craning your necks to reach it. </span></p>
<h3><b>Sweat the Details</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make your study spot a place you want to be in. Keep your space clean and tidy, and fill it with objects you love, but won’t find too distracting, like a pretty notebook or photo of your family. Plants are another great choice. Spending time in nature has been shown to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce stress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give you energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help you feel happier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working by a window isn’t just pleasant — it’s good for you. According to <a href="https://www.workdesign.com/2017/05/harnessing-power-natural-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorkDesign</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light can make you more engaged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and reduce headaches, eye strain, and blurred vision by as much as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">84 percent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, quiet is essential in order to be able to focus; </span><a href="https://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/compressed_WorldGBC_Health_Wellbeing__Productivity_Full_Report_Dbl_Med_Res_Feb_2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracting sounds can cause performance to drop by as much as 66 percent.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So make sure your study spot is somewhere you can actually concentrate. </span></p>
