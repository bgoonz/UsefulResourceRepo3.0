<p>In the era of <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-big-data-has-transformed-sports">big data</a>, cybersecurity is increasingly important in protecting digital data from damage, theft, or attack. Digital data can include industry information, intellectual property, identifiable information, personal and protected health information, and more.</p>

<p>Digital leaders today must understand how security threats exploit our most commonly-used technologies. The Cybersecurity Certificate Course is for those who want a practical, leading-edge understanding of the threat landscape, security best practices, and industry techniques,” said Field.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Tech Defining the Future of Work </strong>– the latest panel in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on October 8th and featured executives from League, Fiverr, Prudential, and Microsoft. </p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;">

 </div>




<p>Technology was already transforming the ways we work, both as individuals and as companies, long before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. When offices emptied out earlier in the year, this process was greatly accelerated, which created daunting new challenges – and a few opportunities. The need to adapt the ways we work and the focus on digital continues to this day, and will persist well into the future – even long after the pandemic has ended.</p>



<p>We spoke with four experts – from Microsoft, League, Fiverr, and Prudential – about how they’re leading the monumental shift toward more dispersed ways of working, both for their employees and for the clients they serve.</p>



<p><strong>Embracing Tech Is No Longer Optional</strong></p>



<p>As the pandemic drives workforces to disperse physically, technology has stepped in to keep us connected. The demand for tools like teleconferencing and cloud storage may seem obvious in hindsight, but that doesn’t diminish the challenge of rolling them out rapidly, and at scale.</p>



<p>As Jordan Sheridan, Modern Workplace Lead at Microsoft, explains, “Remote work isn&#8217;t exactly new in 2020, but this is the first time that everybody’s had to embrace it: … What tools do we need? What security considerations do we have? … How do we connect, collaborate? Helping our customers put the infrastructures in place that will allow them to [work remotely] was the biggest challenge about scaling that infrastructure. In April, our CEO said that we saw about two years of acceleration in two months.”</p>



<p>Gil Sheinfeld, CTO of freelancer marketplace Fiverr, agrees with Sheridan. “Since COVID started, the world has been forced to work differently. Remote work and digital transformation are not optional, but mandatory. We’ve seen increased demand for all sorts of business services, especially for e-commerce related services. And also from many businesses who need to transform their business from the offline world to the online world.”</p>



<p>Sheinfeld’s observation speaks to a less obvious demand for new digital tools – namely, ways to help deliver traditionally offline goods and services with the online customer service users have come to expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every organization is now starting to shift into a technology organization,” says Shradha Prakash, VP Future of Work, Org Design and Talent Enablement at Prudential. “Customers want that one-click experience. And it’s very difficult to replicate that. Businesses that were previously based on relationships, now, suddenly, are more about convenience, more about bringing that same experience to a digital platform. And if we need to provide those kinds of technological enhancements, what are the processes we need to change, and what are the structural implications of it?”</p>



<p>Susan Van Klink, CRO of the health benefits hub League, sees the silver lining in the rush to move services online. “In the accelerated move to the cloud, companies are looking for consumer-centric, personalized, engaging solutions that employees will use.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In League’s field, virtual health care, the pandemic has accelerated that shift “by about a decade,” Van Klink says, “in terms of access to mental health care, access to physical health care, and access to third party solutions that will help people manage their health better. We see all of this as a great thing – but it’s really exposed the need for companies to have a digital footprint and an infrastructure.”</p>



<p><strong>Technological Change Drives Organizational Change</strong></p>



<p>A dispersed workforce, cloud-based tools, and online customer service affect not just the way individuals do their jobs, but also the ways entire organizations operate. One of the first demands this shift placed on businesses was for drastically improved agility.</p>



<p>Van Klink says, “COVID has revealed a lot of gaps in the current system, as it relates to accessibility, lack of data, direct correlation to business continuity, and having a healthy workforce to drive your business forward.” Each of those gaps represents an opportunity for businesses to embrace new ways of working.</p>



<p>Prakash concurs. “It opened up the world for us. Leadership sometimes didn’t have exposure to remote working or virtual environments, and that was constraining their thinking. And suddenly it was like, ‘Oh, now I can actually work in different time zones, I can work out of different cities, I can work out of different talent clusters.’”</p>



<p>That decentralization has translated into deeper changes to managerial structure. Whereas business strategy once came from the top down, a decentralized workforce armed with the correct collaboration tools can generate strategic insights at every level. The result is improved talent enablement, similar to the Japanese concept of <em>kaizen</em>, where business activities are continuously improved by all employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Talent enablement means helping your [people] lead and drive business strategy to produce outcomes,” Prakash explains. “It’s a collective, democratized way of ensuring your talent understands how the work is done and what it requires to get work done.” While this was often outsourced to consulting firms in the past, a more decentralized, democratized workforce means that “everybody in the organization should be responsible for doing it.”</p>



<p><strong>Human Problems Require Human-Centered Solutions</strong></p>



<p>Businesses are, after all, made up of people. But while the problems WFH poses for business are different from the ones we face as individuals, digital tools offer ways to help us adapt.</p>



<p>A major pitfall of working from home is the loss of community – those chance encounters that not only give rise to unexpected opportunities for collaboration, but are also integral to employee’s mental well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was an organic ability to connect the dots over water coolers and during restroom breaks and in corridors,” Prakash notes. “There was a time when people would meet in the cafeteria and talk about their kids and dogs. Suddenly, that’s losing out, because we don’t bump into each other on a digital platform.”</p>



<p>At League, Van Klink says, they’ve turned to digital tools like Donut to stimulate serendipitous conversation, replicating what happens organically in an office. “The tricky part is maintaining that social connection,” she says. This was especially true in the case of new hires. “We had to create a whole new process around virtual recruiting and onboarding that would help convey the culture of the company without the face-to-face component available to us.” Even social media platforms like Instagram are useful in maintaining visibility to employees and customers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to recruitment efforts at Microsoft, Sheridan says, “We’ve had good success with things like breakout rooms. Instead of a traditional hackathon that you’d do in person in a large room, we set up breakout rooms and send people into smaller group interactions to get that same feel of how they’re interacting together.”</p>



<p>Maintaining a sense of community online – a trend well underway even before the pandemic – is one thing. Addressing the mental strain unique to remote working is quite another. As Sheridan explains, “Your brain actually processes differently as you’re participating in a video call than it would if you were on a conference call or sitting in a meeting room. Technology overload is definitely taking its toll in different ways.” Microsoft Teams has responded by allowing people to sync their teleconferencing backgrounds, “to make the meeting a little bit more engaging, make it feel a little bit more natural, and try to bring down that fatigue.”</p>



<p>Another contributor to fatigue for the WFH set is the gradual blurring of work and home. Counterintuitively, doing away the morning and evening commute hasn’t improved mental well-being; it’s only allowed the stresses of work to bleed into home life. In response, Sheridan’s team has been toying with a virtual commute, “to create that demarcation between the work environment and the home environment” and allow people to shift gears, decompress, and compartmentalize.</p>



<p>Ultimately, our experts are optimistic that we will collectively learn how to regain the benefits of the physical office – the separation of work and home, the sense of community, the ability to collaborate and find spontaneous connections – without losing any of the advantages that remote working offers – like access to a broader talent pool, opportunities to relocate, improved agility, and more input from across a company’s org chart.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the competition to discover and lure top tech talent heats up, some of the world’s top tech companies have found great success by rethinking a longtime requirement in their search for skilled workers: the college degree.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/degree-problem-you-can-still-land-jobs-top-companies-joseph-milord/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a number of leading companies have ditched their requirements for a four-year college degree, including Google, Apple, IBM, Nordstrom, Costco and Bank of America. That’s in line with recommendations from experts like those at the Harvard Business Review, which declared in 2017 that “competency is more important than credentials” and warned of how degree requirements could threaten the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, a bachelor’s degree is no longer a barrier for entry to work at the world’s top companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world, those are exceptional human beings,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google’s former senior vice-president of people operations, Laszlo Bock. “And we should do everything we can to find those people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why has there been such a dramatic shift in educational expectations? Here are some of the reasons tech workers no longer need a college degree to thrive in their field. </span></p>
<h2><b>It’s All About Skills</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an influential 2016 letter to U.S. President Donald Trump, IBM President and CEO Ginni Rometty described the rise of “new collar” jobs and the shifting skills requirements to excel in those positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, IBM’s vice-president of talent Joanna Daley told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/why-ibm-wants-to-hire-employees-who-dont-have-a-4-year-college-degree.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC Make It</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that about 15 percent of her company’s U.S. hires don’t have a four-year degree and that the tech company now looks at candidates who have hands-on experience through bootcamps or industry-related vocational classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Getting a job at today’s IBM does not always require a college degree; at some of our centers in the United States, as many as one-third of employees have less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes obtained through vocational training,” Rometty </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition, we are creating and hiring to fill ‘new collar’ jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, and cognitive business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelling in positions such as those often requires highly specialized training that is in line with the absolute latest industry trends, which isn’t necessarily a strength of large colleges with rigid four-year curriculums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, HackerRank’s annual survey of student developers attending college found that only 32 percent reported learning to code in school, with 27 percent saying they were self-taught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More businesses should overhaul their outdated practices and stop pretending that when it comes to the skills they need in employees, there’s any correlation between a degree from one of the nation’s elite schools and high performance,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/college-degree-requirements-upwork/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains why a LinkedIn study found that companies including Apple, Oracle, and Google often ask either for a degree or “equivalent practical experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The four-year degree isn’t gone altogether but we’re starting to see a shift in what these companies are looking for,” </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-dont-need-a-4-year-college-degree-for-these-high-paying-jobs-at-google-apple-netflix-2019-04-08"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Laura Lorenzetti, editor at LinkedIn. “There’s a growing emphasis on skills over school as they compete for top talent. People still see the four-year degree as a signaling factor but companies are taking experience as seriously as a four-year degree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>A Tech Talent Shortage Has Employers Rethinking Their Priorities</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you have surely heard about the industry-wide– and ever-growing – </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/canadas-tech-talent-gap-increasing-the-value-of-digital-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for tech talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that there are simply not enough skilled workers to meet it. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is forecasting the employment of computer and information technology professionals to grow by 13 percent by 2026 – faster than the average for all occupations. Meanwhile, a recent report from G2 Crowd found that 80.8 percent of employers reported that it’s more difficult to fill positions now compared to 2015, while 51 percent said that the difficulty owed to a lack of talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM has felt that crunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got a massive skills gap across the tech industry, so people with non-traditional backgrounds are really becoming valuable,” </span><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-you-dont-need-a-4year-degree-to-get-the-tech-job-of-your-dreams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kelli Jordan, talent leader for IBM’s New Collar Initiatives program. “You don’t need to go get a computer science degree to be a web developer. You can learn those languages in a variety of ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, a phenomenon called “degree inflation” led to many companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for jobs that had traditionally been filled by workers who didn’t have one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2014 report from Burning Glass Technologies looked at the scope of degree inflation by comparing the number of people in a certain occupation who have a degree to the number of job postings requiring one. The report found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs, 21 percent for computer and math jobs, and 13 percent for sales jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a glaring shortage of talent in tech, it would be self-defeating for companies to exclude so many skilled workers because they don’t have a credential that might not even be relevant to their job.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For decades, at many companies that I worked for, I wasn’t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four-year degree,” </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/need-college-degree-get-job-these-companies-say-skills-matter-n1001526"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trish Torizzo, chief information officer for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which recently dropped its degree requirement for applicants.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Now) supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It Creates a More Inclusive Environment</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ottawa-based eCommerce giant Shopify has never demanded a college degree in its job postings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t require any background or a specific amount of experience in any specific field. Instead, we want someone who can make an impact,” </span><a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/work/want-a-job-in-canadian-tech-dont-worry-about-that-university-degree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shopify’s director of talent acquisition Anna Lambert, who noted that after seven years – and 3,000 hires! – she has seen a major shift in the industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s less focus on experience and more on your ability to do the job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Lambert’s recruitment team includes someone who used to be a welder – a background she says is “very different, but somehow totally applicable.” She suggests that instead of asking prospective employees for a specific experience and deciding they aren’t qualified, try to make all people feel welcome and consider where their strengths might lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A more inclusive job posting will show that you know experience comes in all forms – and you want that,” Lambert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a more open-minded approach to educational requirements could also help to reverse the tide of an ongoing crisis in tech: a lack of diversity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges in the U.S. and around the world continue to struggle with </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/can-people-like-me-go-to-college-inequality-and-dreams-of-higher-ed-73893"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequality and a lack of diversity among their student populations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That mainly owes to economics; while </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cpa.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">83 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of students from high-income families in the U.S. enroll in college, only 63 percent from low- and middle-income families do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of what motivated Upwork to drop their degree requirements for new hires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly, four-year universities produce too few graduating classes that are reflective of the country’s racial, social, and economic diversity,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/college-degree-requirements-upwork/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel. “Because of their soaring fees, colleges are pricing themselves out of reach for many Americans. As a result, businesses are in danger of being walled off from huge sections of America’s talented pool.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who may be shunted to the margins of the labor market won’t be disqualified for lack of intelligence or skill, but because they simply can’t afford to pay for school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a 2017 research project from the Harvard Business School determined that employers “appear to be closing off their access to the two-thirds of the U.S. workforce that does not have a four-year college degree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is only getting worse as college becomes more out-of-reach for many Americans; average annual tuition costs at four-year universities more than doubled between the 1985-86 and 2015-16 academic years, from $12,052 to $26,120 after adjusting to inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If education becomes unaffordable for most and companies continue to require college degrees, we’ll perpetuate a system by which those companies will only hire from a relatively small and privileged group of graduates,” Kasriel said. “That makes no business sense for a country that’s already suffering from a painful lack of know-how in many crucial tech sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also isn’t fitting for a country known as the land of opportunity.”</span></p>
<h2><b>A Lack of Value</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both employers and workers alike are complaining that the four-year college degree isn’t necessarily bringing an adequate return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve covered the high costs of a college education already, and the results aren’t necessarily always there. According to the 2018 Freelancing in America survey, 93 percent of freelancers with a four-year college degree said skills training was useful for the work they currently did, compared to only 79 percent who said their college education was useful.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 DigitalOcean survey found that bootcamp grads heading into a software engineering position felt “much better prepared for the real world” than four-year college grads, by a margin of 61 percent to 36 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that perceived lack of value goes both ways. From an employer’s perspective, Harvard’s report found that degree-holders command an 11-to-30 percent wage premium, but fail to justify that premium in productivity or other outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the report found that college graduates filling these positions “are costing companies more money to employ, tend to be less engaged in their jobs, have a higher turnover rate, and reach productivity levels only on par with high school graduates doing the same job.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It Can Improve the Lives of Their Workers</b><b><br />
</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there are plenty of great reasons to pursue a college education. But getting a degree only because it seems like a prerequisite to finding a job isn’t one, and crushing student debt is taking a huge toll on the American workforce.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 44.2 million Americans are now carrying student loan debt, and those Americans owe more than $1.48 trillion collectively – roughly $620 billion more than total U.S. credit card debt. Research from Citizens Financial Group showed that 60 percent of student debt borrowers can expect to pay off their loans in their 40s, while another </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8LurBVUNQZfQVhYZWZvamlfd00/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that Wisconsin university graduates take on average 19.7 years to pay off a bachelor’s degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While tech companies compete to offer their employees the best packages of benefits and perks, there’s certainly something to be said for a workforce who aren’t buried under a pile of debt.</span></p>
<h2><b>Follow the Leader</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry trends often start at the top, and when it comes to loosening or dropping degree demands – to put it simply – all the biggest companies seem to be doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, a recent LinkedIn study showed that many of the companies listed among its 2019 LinkedIn Top Companies in the U.S. no longer require a degree, including Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Netflix, Airbnb, Facebook, Oracle, Dell, and, of course, Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that about half of Apple’s U.S. employment in 2018 was made up of people who didn’t have a four-year degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stressed instead the need for certain in-demand skills; in Apple’s case, that skill is coding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we’ve looked at the…mismatch between the skills that are coming out of colleges and what the skills are that we believe we need in the future, and many other businesses do, we’ve identified coding as a very key one,” he </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-why-college-degree-isnt-necessary-2019-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainly makes sense given that Apple’s Steve Jobs famously founded the company after dropping out of college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company, as you know, was founded by a college drop-out,” Cook </span><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftop-companies-are-hiring-more-candidates-without-a-4-year-degree-2019-4&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fdegree-problem-you-can-still-land-jobs-top-companies-joseph-milord%2F&amp;xguid=67b5964b3e61ef97c1d7513af1846f14&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=30439db150c9a1425c3c997e96b18423"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “So we’ve never really thought that a college degree was the thing that you had to do well. We’ve always tried to expand our horizons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Jobs wasn’t the only tech trailblazer who didn’t hold a degree. The same could be said of Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Dell’s Michael Dell, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, and Whatsapp’s Jan Koum.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BCG’s 2018 digital maturity survey of top restaurant brands found that 80 percent had access to a wealth of data. There’s a big opportunity there – BCG’s numbers found that <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#data,on-campus#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_datausedinrestaurants">data and analytics programs</a> yield five to 10 percent increases in revenue, 10 to 15 percent reductions in store-level operating costs, and 10 to 20 percent improvements in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization). Further, digital restaurant leaders’ total shareholder return has almost doubled the S&amp;P 500. And the National Restaurant Association’s 2019 State of the Industry report found that eight in 10 restaurant operators agree that the use of technology provides a competitive advantage and many planned to ramp up their efforts in that area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, data could be critical to the ongoing health of the restaurant business. An August 2018 report from The NPD Group found that the total restaurant count in the U.S. saw a one percent year-over-year decrease. Unlocking the insights of the reams of numbers available to restaurants could be crucial to their survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the ways big data has already transformed the food industry, and what further changes might be on the horizon.</span></p>

<h3><b>Inspire – and Recognize – Loyalty, While Luring Back Lapsed Guests</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it seems like every fast-casual restaurant and coffee chain has a mobile app these days, there’s a good reason – it’s a crucial way to help you order faster while also learning more about you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And restaurant and delivery mobile apps are indeed more popular than ever. BCG’s study found that the installed user base for three top apps – Starbucks, McDonald’s, and Dominos – has grown from 45 million users to 76 million from June 2016 to 2018, while the number of users with Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub leaped from 9 million to 42 million over that same period. A survey </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/483857/restaurant-apps-usage-reasons-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that most diners use restaurant mobile apps to view menus and prices (55 percent), scour deals (38.2 percent), order food (30 percent), and reserve a table (23.8 percent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BCG’s numbers, U.S. restaurant loyalty programs now also have a combined 130 million members, more than double their 2015 level – which means dining is the fastest-growing industry for loyalty programs. More than two-thirds of diners are members of at least one such program, and 25 percent say they’re members of three or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps generally have the effect of bringing customers back more often. In fact, 40 percent of app users </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-ca/publications/2018/feeding-algorithm-restaurants-use-data-capture-competitive-advantage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that they increased their visit frequency after downloading. Research from BCG shows that restaurant companies with “well-defined, strategically executed” loyalty programs can boost incremental revenues by 10 to 15 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does your data play into that? Starbucks’ app is a good example. The company’s loyalty program is a gold standard for personalization, with tailored messages and offers being sent to people based on their ordering history. Starbucks often uses the program to get you in the door, whether you’re a regular – for instance, if you ordered a Venti Americano three days in a row, you might receive an email with incentives to extend your coffee streak another few days – or a lapsed customer who might be tempted back with a too-good-to-be-true deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made massive investments and made progress on personalization, ahead of what I would say other restaurant brands to date have been able to accomplish,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/personalized-fast-food-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Martin, a Partner at BCG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? Their app just keeps getting more popular – according to Starbucks’ 2019 third-quarter results, active Starbucks Rewards Membership in the U.S. increased 14 percent year-over-year to 17.2 million users.</span></p>
<h3><b>Improve Operating Efficiency</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data isn’t just being used to bring more hungry patrons into the restaurant – it’s also having a major back-of-house impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from Toast found that 78 percent of restaurant managers look at their metrics and finances daily, compared to 46 percent two years prior. And 95 percent of restaurateurs think technology improves efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of that is the fast-casual chain Panera Bread, which unveiled its Panera 2.0 plan to drive digital orders in 2014. Panera collects information about orders on all its digital channels to prepare for in-store labor and product needs, and that data has informed real changes at the chain, including redesigned kitchens and a reworked assembly line. As a result of those changes, the chain – which now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> half of all sales could soon be digital – </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-panera-solved-its-mosh-pit-problem-1496395801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">managed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut its wait time to order food from eight minutes to one minute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not alone in leveraging data to smooth their operating process. Domino’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built an algorithm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to predict how long it would take to make and deliver a pizza – with factors including number and tenure of staff in the restaurant – while UberEats and DoorDash are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop the best model to predict delivery time, taking into account weather data, sports schedules, and seasonal irregularities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is also helping restaurateurs recognize their star employees – and who might be underperforming. It’s especially helpful for people managing multiple restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Charlee Williamson of the New Orleans-based Ralph Brennan Restaurant Group oversaw six managers and 78 servers on the other side of the country, at California’s Jazz Kitchen. She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Server Scorecard, offered by the restaurant management software company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avero</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ranks servers on multiple criteria and helps match the right waiter to the right table. For instance, a server who ranks higher in sales might be the right fit for a high-rolling party, while another who excels at tip percentage could be best-suited to handle a difficult table full of rowdy children.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nailing the Menu (and Finding Flavor Trends)</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Applebee’s made the rather radical shift in 2016 to what was thought to be a millennial-friendly menu, it didn’t work out – to put it mildly. The chain announced in 2017 plans to close over 100 locations, and executives pointed to the fact that the youth-focused offerings had alienated what they believed to be their core guests: boomers and gen-Xers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company went back to the drawing board, they did so armed with data. Adrian Butler, the SVP and Chief Information Officer of Dine Brands (the parent company of Applebee’s), outlined a 4D technology strategy to help the restaurant regain its momentum: Data, Discovery, Dining, Delivery. The focus was on “leveraging data and analytics of our guests and operations to craft personalized experiences,” beginning with the menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applebee’s began to poll its customers via tabletop device surveys, and by the end of 2017, the chain had noticed a 7 percent uptick in overall guest satisfaction. As they dug deeper into data, they also realized why their millennial-focused menu had been such a misfire – their clientele was already evenly </span><a href="https://www.michiganstateuniversityonline.com/resources/business-analytics/dining-on-big-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">split</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among generations, with 26.4 percent boomers, 28.3 percent gen-Xers, and 29.9 percent millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data isn’t just useful for restaurants looking to make their menus shine. It also helps us understand what foods are whetting American appetites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pork lovers among us might have noticed that bacon is suddenly everywhere – in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sundaes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cocktails, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And thanks to Wired, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Food Network to analyze 49,733 recipes and 906,539 comments from their website, we learned that everything really is better with bacon. Together, they searched all the recipes that fit a certain description – pizza, for instance – and calculated the average rating for those foods that did not include bacon. They found that the recipes with bacon did score higher – and the only exceptions were among pasta and desserts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They drilled deeper and looked at other food fads and how they’ve waxed and waned over time, with ingredients like Portobello mushrooms and sriracha seemingly being past their moment in the sun. Lada Adamic, a Computer Scientist at the University of Michigan and Facebook, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wired’s research even further and found that feta, cream cheese, cranberries, strawberries, and avocado were also reliable recipe hits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate project, Adamic wanted to see if it was possible to create a predictive algorithm to see how a recipe would turn out. She and her team took nearly 50,000 recipes and 2 million reviews from allrecipes.com and created an algorithm to extract out all the ingredients, cooking methods, and nutritional profiles, then looked at how often two ingredients were paired together in the same recipe. She </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/11/19/165294248/could-nate-silver-predict-how-good-your-pumpkin-pie-will-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that her algorithm predicted with nearly 80 percent accuracy how many stars a recipe would get on the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Adamic was inspired by her own kitchen frustrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was having trouble moving beyond literally reading the recipe and then following it exactly,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, I just believe in data,” she added. “Now I feel more comfortable using spices more freely.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Improve Customer Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since few are forecasting a big leap in restaurant patronage, many restaurateurs have shifted from focusing on the number of customers to the quality of experience each visitor has – and data has been a big help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total restaurant traffic is not growing, so anything restaurants can do to offer a better customer experience differentiates them from the competition,” </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-restaurants-are-using-big-data-as-a-competitive-tool-1538515392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Portalatin, a food-industry adviser at market-research firm NPD Group Inc. and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eating Patterns in America.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the primary way most restaurants are capitalizing on data to form a better bond with diners is through personalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TGI Fridays, for instance, began gathering data from point-of-sale systems, social media, credit-card transactions, and mobile devices to create personalized campaigns for the four million-plus guests who have given the company permission to contact them directly. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">result</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was stark: the chain doubled its to-go business in the 12 months leading up to August 2018 and increased social media engagement by more than 500 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gone are the days of trying to figure out what millennials want versus boomers,” </span><a href="https://www.eater.com/2018/10/10/17957350/restaurants-data-mining-personal-information-privacy-loyalty-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> TGI Fridays Chief Experience Officer Sherif Mityas. “We want to know what Mary wants versus Susan, and we need an unprecedented amount of data, analytics, and machine-learning to utilize this data in the best possible way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based reservation systems allow restaurants to create detailed profiles on patrons with notes on everything from dietary restrictions to beer preferences. That information could be shared across an entire restaurant group, allowing servers to offer a customer their favorite IPA or a not-too-spicy appetizer they might love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants have numerous ways to collect that data. McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A dangle free food in exchange for diners filling out surveys rating their experience. Starbucks has always offered free wi-fi, but as of April 2018, the coffee chain </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Starbucks-wifi-policy-change-481089611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users to submit their full name, email address, and zip code before surfing the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California-based chain Tender Greens, meanwhile, uses the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Punchh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile app to log each customer’s name, email address, and purchase history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives us ways to recognize people who’ve been in regularly or haven’t been in for a while or have specific preferences,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founder Erik Oberholtzer.  “We want to accommodate everyone’s needs, sometimes before they even mention them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just fast-food or fast-casual restaurants that are using data to boost customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s Michelin-starred </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oriole</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses data from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upserve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system to determine who are their top 100 guests (in terms of the number of visits and amount spent) and creates a profile with every first-time reservation. Upserve also tracks the top 100’s dining companions when they divide up the bill, sending a list of credit-card numbers, dates of visits and what was bought. The restaurant matches the numbers to a name, then uses social media to put a face to that name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t know that someone’s going to become a regular, so you don’t necessarily keep track of those people. But the system does,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/dining/restaurant-software-analytics-data-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Co-Owner Cara Sandoval, adding that they’re sure to recognize regulars when they come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn’t make the reservation themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the simple fact that ordering via a mobile device – whether for pickup or delivery – is just faster and more convenient than standing in line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, restaurant digital orders have grown at an average annual rate of 23 percent since 2013 – now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">representing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3.1 billion visits and $26.8 billion – and will triple in volume by the end of 2020, according to the NDP Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Digital orders will remain an outsized source of growth for the restaurant industry over the next few years and operators who desire to grow need to embrace a digital strategy,” </span><a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2019/mobile-apps-now-represent-the-bulk-of-restaurant-digital-orders-and-restaurant-branded-apps-dominate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Portalatin.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Harvard Business School, managers and employees “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perceived the future in significantly different ways,” with employees being much more optimistic about the future than managers may realize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, “workers seem to recognize more clearly than leaders do that their organizations are contending with multiple forces of disruption, each of which will affect how companies work differently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this should clearly serve as a warning to managers and executives, it is also good news of a sort. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the words of the study, “your workforce is more adaptable than you think.” And with a full 74 percent of organizations implementing digital transformation initiatives (and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research showing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it’s cheaper to reskill current employees than to hire new ones), an engaged, adaptable workforce is essential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you tap into this willingness to change? Let’s take a closer look at some ideas behind future-proofing your workforce. </span></p>
<h2><b>Put a Focus on Reskilling </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You wouldn’t sell a product without having a supply chain in place. So why not apply the same thinking about your workforce? That’s one of the suggestions put forth by the report, which states that “while companies are keen to prepare for the future of work, they remain mired in their historical approach to hiring, training, and talent management.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers typically rely on a combination of networking and job postings to secure new talent, but that’s a problem when the talent you’re looking for might not exist in the labor pool. Creating a pipeline for new talent by training and promoting from within is one solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, as part of its Workforce 2020 solution, AT&amp;T collected information about the skills of its 250,000 employees. AT&amp;T compared that information to the skills the company determined it would need to stay competitive in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, AT&amp;T developed a learning program with the goal of training existing employees to meet the future demands of the company. As a result, AT&amp;T is hiring “far fewer” outside contractors because existing staff are able to do the work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/13/atts-1-billion-gambit-retraining-nearly-half-its-workforce.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it expects employees involved in the training program to be four times more likely to make a positive career move, and two times more likely to be hired into a “mission-critical” role at AT&amp;T.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put this kind of reskilling program into place, organizations need to start at the top, identifying and closing skills and knowledge gaps among managers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estée Lauder, for example, sent management teams to BrainStation for digital skills training, which resulted in a robust, </span><a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/02/05/estee-lauder-digital-tactics-are-paying-off.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital-first marketing approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that paid immediate dividends. </span></p>
<h2><b>Engage Employees in the Process </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When employers were asked what was holding employees back from learning new skills, “managers chose answers that blamed employees, rather than themselves,” according to the report. In fact, fear of change was the number one reason managers said is holding employees back from learning new skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while respondents to this survey claimed to be eager to learn and embrace the future (which was backed up in our Digital Skills Survey), </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-fight-employee-turnover-skills-training"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies have nevertheless shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a majority of people do fear change when digital transformation initiatives are introduced, with 39 percent anxious when new tech is introduced.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get around these fears (or at least the perception of fear), organizations can get employees engaged in the process by explaining the why and the how, not just the what. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ING Netherlands used this strategy when they overhauled their workforce to “turn itself into an agile institution almost overnight.” Instead of hiring new staff and laying off existing employees, the bank communicated with staff about upcoming changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, employees who didn’t think they would fit into the new culture were happy to leave (ING provided support to find other jobs), and employees who stayed were eager to learn new skills and transition the company into its next phase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the transition wasn’t easy, CEO Vincent van den Boogert said,  “when you talk about the why, what, and how at the same time, people are going to challenge the why to prevent the how. But in this case, everyone had already been inspired by the why and what.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By engaging employees in the good, the bad, and uncomfortable parts of the process, ING created a win-win situation out of a typically negative experience for employees and employers alike.</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>With the digital economy's rapid pace of change, the right learning management system can make all the difference. </p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-every-business-needs-a-learning-management-system">Why Every Business Needs a Learning Management System</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog">BrainStation® Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning management systems (LMS) have been around for roughly 20 years, but their importance has only increased with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the digital economy&#8217;s rapid pace of change.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from the Association for Talent Development found that 83 percent of surveyed learning professionals confirmed current LMS use, and 71 percent said they had seen an increase in use over the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the specific features and functions of different learning management systems vary, an LMS allows an organization to deploy and track online training initiatives while also providing a home hub for all kinds of important information. More robust learning management systems, like BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/synapse-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse learning platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can offer a host of other features, even allowing students to attend live lectures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your organization is considering taking the leap, here are some of the many benefits you can expect by investing in a learning management system.</span></p>
<h3><b>An LMS Will Save Your Organization Money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATD Research’s 2018 State of the Industry report found that organizations spent $1,296 per employee on learning, a 1.7 percent increase over the year before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So organizations are already investing in continuing education, but an LMS can help focus those efforts and ensure that investment isn’t going to waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s especially true for smaller organizations with limited HR staff, but even in larger organizations with more resources, an LMS can significantly reduce the amount of time your HR department has to spend running training sessions, directing employees to important resources, or responding to queries where answers are easily available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Succession planning also becomes significantly easier when all training materials and programs are centralized and accessible, and likewise, an LMS makes the process of onboarding new hires a breeze – getting your employees up to speed faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, using online classrooms and learning spaces is much more efficient in terms of both time and money than sending employees to in-person training or continuing education programs, which can also include travel and hotel expenses.</span></p>
<h3><b>It Can Provide A better, Deeper Learning Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your employees, an LMS can provide the most convenient, enjoyable and – most importantly – educationally effective training experience possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LMS will give your employees 24-hour access to the learning materials and resources they need, with the flexibility to learn at the office or from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And particularly robust LMS will take that educational experience even farther.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Synapse allows for seamless, responsive real-time feedback that allows for faster and deeper comprehension and engagement. Further, thanks to social learning features across different mediums, students using Synapse will still get the full experience of engaging and networking with classmates and instructors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since Synapse is the world’s first data-driven learning platform, instructors have the ability to track the comprehension of course content to develop a personalized learning experience for each student. Synapse also presents instructor comments on coursework right next to the project requirements, creating a constructive feedback loop that learners appreciate.</span></p>
<h3><b>You Can Track, Report, and Manage Progress</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an LMS, you won’t need to wonder how your employees are faring in their training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A learning management system will allow you to pay careful attention to where employees are in the training process as well as which concepts are proving particularly engaging or challenging. That allows organizations to identify opportunities for further training, areas of organizational weakness, or even employee strengths they might not otherwise have identified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those advanced reporting functions also give you a real sense of the ROI of your training efforts, so you’ll no longer need to guess about their effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those progress management tools are especially crucial within organizations that require any amount of compliance training.</span></p>
<h3><b>Positioning your company for the future</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the capacity to feature multimedia learning tools, to encourage remote digital communication, and to incorporate the very latest in eLearning trends and strategies, a good learning management system will ensure your company is providing the most current and innovative learning experience for your employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the benefits run even deeper as you look forward. We mentioned that succession planning becomes easier with the adoption of an LMS, but it’s even possible that a good LMS might not simply make those transitions easier, but also reduce turnover overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Kronos study found that 87 percent of HR managers polled called improved retention a high or critical priority. If you’re among that group, consider a recent Gallup study that found 87 percent of millennials rate “professional or career growth and development opportunities” as one of the top factors in whether they stay in a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, a robust LMS won’t just help you empower and enrich your employees, it may also help you attract and keep the best talent as well.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written in the past about how digital skills training can help </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-employee-training-can-help-your-digital-transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your company’s digital transformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but there’s increasing evidence that a learning and development (L&amp;D) program is now an essential component of the digital economy. Today’s employees are increasingly seeing the value in ongoing, professional development that improves their performance on the job, and prepares them for the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are three reasons every company should be investing in L&amp;D.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">L&amp;D Improves Employee Engagement and Retention</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee retention often comes down to one thing: engagement. Are your employees engaged in their job and happy to come to work? According to Gallup’s </span><a href="http://www.gallup.com/services/178514/state-american-workplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of the American Workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only 32 percent of workers felt this way about their jobs. Unfortunately, this is most likely exacerbated by the digital transformation that is now changing entire industries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">74 percent of organizations are actively involved in digital transformation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">63 percent of executives say their digital investments are growing.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rapid digital shifts are ultimately creating concerns and anxiety around job security in many organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An L&amp;D program has the benefit of boosting your company’s skill set and knowledge, while also improving overall morale and engagement. It is one of the simplest and most effective ways to show your employees that you care about their development and future, which ultimately plays a big role in keeping them from leaving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence to back this up. </span><a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-value-of-employee-training-and-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2017 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which surveyed 400 employees spanning three generations, 70 percent indicated that job-related training and development opportunities influenced their decision to stay at their job. 87 percent of millennials (who now make up 42 percent of the workforce), also said access to career growth opportunities was very important in deciding whether to stay or go. Overall, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nazbeheshti/2019/01/16/10-timely-statistics-about-the-connection-between-employee-engagement-and-wellness/#7c8f13f522a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly engaged teams are said to experience 59 percent less turnover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than teams that are less engaged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can have a massive impact on the bottom line, particularly when it comes to closing skills gaps. According to a 2019 </span><a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Towards_a_Reskilling_Revolution.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s now cheaper to reskill current employees than to hire new ones, which means an effective L&amp;D program can save your company valuable time and money that would have otherwise been spent on recruiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also been suggested that a 10 percent increase in educational development leads to an </span><a href="https://www.businessknowhow.com/manage/higherprod.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.6 percent gain in productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly engaged workforces outperforming less engaged teams by 147</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> percent. According to The American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), companies that offer comprehensive training also have a 24 percent higher profit margin and a six percent higher shareholder return over companies that do not provide training.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Builds Your Employer Brand</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the reviews-based world we live in, people can easily turn to social media or websites like Glassdoor and Payscale to read anonymous reviews from current or past employees to discover what it’s really like to work somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/19-interesting-hiring-statistics-you-should-know.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">54 percent of us do</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means an employer’s reputation is now more important (and more fragile) than ever, and providing ongoing learning opportunities is an easy way to cultivate a strong workplace culture and employer brand. Apart from the impact, this can have on your company’s reputation, there is evidence to suggest that it can be a recruitment tool in and of itself. In fact, 42 percent of employees say </span><a href="http://www.selectinternational.com/blog/10-employee-engagement-statistics-of-2018-how-to-learn-from-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning and development is the most important benefit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">when deciding where to work.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Improves Company-wide Innovation and Performance </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Richard Branson has famously said, “Clients do not come first. Employees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’ve embedded a culture of learning and support in your workplace, innovation is a natural and fruitful by-product. An ongoing learning strategy provides a context for your team to think forward. And by mapping out your employees’ career pathways, you are not only promoting a leadership mindset among junior employees but also preparing your company for long-term growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation keeps employees engaged, excited, and encourages them to perform better, which will be reflected in your brand as an industry leader that stays ahead of trends. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-value-of-employee-training-and-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“companies with engaged employees outperform those without by up to 202%.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only does ongoing learning support the team on the ground by creating a “</span><a href="https://gelbgroup.com/why-a-learning-culture-helps-you-improve-your-companys-bottom-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pool of employees who are quick learners and flexible workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” it also enables senior leadership to embrace innovation and “weave [it] into the daily business processes of the company to reduce costs and wastage and drive up productivity and profits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So whether your company is interested in new techniques to engage your team, a strategy to improve your employer reputation, or ongoing innovation, a comprehensive learning and development program will help address those challenges.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C-suite leaders are worried about their company’s ability to compete with born-digital businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the finding from a new </span><a href="https://www.protiviti.com/US-en/insights/protiviti-top-risks-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Protiviti and North Carolina State University that surveyed executives about risks businesses are facing in 2019. Results from this year’s survey show a significant increase in digital readiness concerns, jumping from the number 10 position in 2018 to number one in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s why the ability to adapt to digital is more important than ever, and how to ensure your business isn’t left behind.</span></p>
<p><b>What is a Born-Digital Business? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born digital businesses were created during and after the post-1990s era of the Internet, email and social media. And with technology evolving faster than ever, born-digital businesses could have a significant advantage when it comes to keeping up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Organizations have much greater concerns that their existing operations and legacy IT infrastructure may not be able to meet performance expectations as well as companies that are ‘born digital,’” says Pat Scott, Executive Vice President at global consulting firm Protiviti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executives surveyed for BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> agreed digital readiness is a top priority, with 74 percent reporting their organization is actively involved in digital transformation activities. More than half (63 percent) also said their digital investments are growing and 89 percent said there are elements of their products and services that did not exist five years earlier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both reports make it clear technology is changing the way we live and work, and that businesses must adapt to stay competitive. Now, let’s look at some of the ways executives can compete with born-digital businesses and a few examples of companies winning and losing the race. </span></p>
<p><b>Competing With Born-Digital Businesses </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of digital transformation is a company’s ability to self-assess their position in the digital landscape. To help businesses stay on track, there are </span><a href="https://www.financialexecutives.org/FEI-Daily/December-2018/4-Ways-to-Compete-With-%E2%80%98Born-Digital%E2%80%99-Organization.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four questions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Protiviti recommends executives ask when thinking about how to compete with born-digital businesses: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself where you are on a scale of digital readiness (Are you a skeptic, a beginner, a follower, or an innovator? Where are your competitors?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate your employee’s skill sets and talents (Do you have staff who understand the technology your business will need to grow?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate your leadership team’s skill set and talents (Do you have a mix of seasoned executives and leaders who understand new trends in technology?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcome resistance to change (Do leadership and staff resist or welcome change?)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Canada Post, a 250-year-old business in the midst of digital transformation, for example. The first step towards a digital transformation is self-awareness, and Canada Post recognized they needed to make big changes to move from a traditional brick and mortar business into a digital leader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lead to the 2011 launch of a digital strategy focused on eCommerce and user experience. Part of that strategy involved updating their recruitment process to attract top digital talent, creating a digitally-friendly office, and empowering existing staff to change their roles through training.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve invested a lot to create an environment where people don’t feel like they’re coming to an old, archaic organization with old bureaucracy in the way,” said Canada Post’s Director of Design and User Experience, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-a-250-year-old-postal-company-is-becoming-a-digital-leader" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vadim Tslaf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far their plan is paying off. Canada Post is a leader in eCommerce delivery and their annual revenue has nearly doubled since 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, we can look to Blockbuster, Toys R Us and recently bankrupt Payless ShoeSource as examples of businesses that didn’t update their business model soon enough to contend with born-digital competitors.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, in its </span><a href="https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/payless-to-close-248-canadian-stores-saying-its-ill-equipped-for-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bankruptcy filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Payless (founded in 1956) cited the company’s “inability to keep up with the shift in customer demand” and a failure to add a digital offering as its downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples like Canada Post and Payless prove that ‘digital transformation’ is more than just a buzzword. The ability to adapt to new technology could make the difference between a business that thrives and a business that doesn’t survive. Where will your business land?</span></p>
