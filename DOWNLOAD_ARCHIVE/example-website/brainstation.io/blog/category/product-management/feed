<p><strong>Brick &amp; Mortar to Click &amp; Order: Retail Experience in 2021</strong> – the first instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series –&nbsp; took place on January 21 and featured leaders from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;">
<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/503248993?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">2020 was a year that transformed retail, forcing brands to reconsider and re-invest in the way they market and sell their products among increased online competition.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Many top brands are now offering faster shipping and one-click checkout for seamless UX, as well as AR/VR experiences that allow customers to “touch-and-feel” their preferred products. There has also been an increased focus on omni-channel selling, most notably on social media, with a record of $23.3 billion in social commerce sales expected by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">We spoke with digital marketing and product experts from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong> to share insights on how they’ve adapted their in-person and online shopping experiences for customers, and the trends and channels have been most successful in preparing for the future.<br></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Invest in Ideas Early</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the rapid pace of innovation over the course of the year, some brands had to play catch up to pivot their offerings to fit the digital landscape. Many of the brands that saw success during these uncertain times were ones that were already investing in digital channels and opportunities.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Jonathon Relkin, Director of Off-Premise at Chipotle, credited his team for being an early adopter of emerging tech, from third-party partnerships to Tik Tok. “We were laying the foundation prior to all of this happening,” he said. “We invested in a digital flow from what the customer sees to the back of house operations.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Relkin also saw a swift change in where their revenue was coming from, “20 percent of revenue was coming from digital before. In the height of Corona it went as high as 70 percent. Now we’re averaging at 50 percent and we’re able to lean into it because of the work and investments made to have digital success.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Daniella Bellaire, Head of Global Revenue Enablement and Shopify, noted that whenever changes appear, reducing barriers of adoption across the board is a good place to start.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Retailers are more adaptable than people thought,” she said. Shopify partnered with the Government of Canada to create a Go Digital Canada initiative to help entrepreneurs start up their businesses during this time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Make Data-Driven Decisions&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">For a Consumer Packaging Goods (CPG) company like General Mills, change can be slow as annual cycles have been used for decades. The company, however, has been able to navigate these tricky times by optimizing existing strategies and attempting to automate as many processes as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Our motto for our omnichannel is ‘to show up brilliantly’,” said Jay Picconatto, Director of Commerce at General Mills. “Our retailers wanted quality content across platforms. Most of our energy has been spent to show up brilliantly on all platforms.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The company has also focused on director-to-consumer (D2C) shopping, allowing them to gather and analyze relevant data on their customers, brand, and operational partners. With this information, they&#8217;ve been able to review the effectiveness of their digital strategy and optimize approaches, processes, and campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“E-commerce a year ago was less than five percent of our business. Now, it&#8217;s more than double that. We&#8217;ve had to really have a heavy lift on some of those process tools and capabilities, even just ways of working to make sure that we show up brilliantly on our retailers platforms.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Focus on Your Brand Story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Both Relkin and Bellaire agree that having consistent brand storytelling across your channels is important to a consumer to buy-into the ethos of your brand, to then buy your products. This means investing in your digital infrastructure and leveraging the resources available to you.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“We fundamentally believe we can change the world one burrito at a time,” said Relkin. “We look at our digital ecosystem and the channels that we show up on and really think about who&#8217;s there, why are they there, what are they interested in, and how do we engage in that conversation as a brand.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The reality is digital affords us an ability to do storytelling and probably a better way than than a traditional grocery store does,” said Picconatto. “It allows us to provide solutions in a way that we never could figure out in store. For example, we can even bundle things in different parts of the store online.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Picconatto points to an example how his digital team jumped on a Barbie cake trend that allowed them to sell dolls alongside their Betty Crocker cake mixes. “We could never pull that off in-store,” he said.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Integrate Digital and Analog Experiences</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the adoption of digital platforms and e-commerce, delivering a great user experience is now practically mandatory for success in today’s market. While retailers are looking to create and innovate their digital experiences, our panelists also remind brands to invest in their physical spaces as well, and to rethink how they could be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“User experience is really at the forefront of the digital experience and the online shopping experience. Making sure it’s easy to put things into a cart, and that it’s easy to check out,” said Bellaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Most of the growth online is still being fulfilled in store,” said Picconatto. “When you think about click and collect models for grocery performance, for example.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Stores are working with band-aids right now with having fulfillment warehouses bolted onto the buildings or just sitting in the front of the store. You need to think through the total product offering needed to make [the pick up experience] easier.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Convenience will prevail,” said Bellaire. “But if there’s a unique experience involved, I will show up and I will buy in-person because I want to support my community.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Ultimately, humans love tangible experiences and value convenience. With the retail changes that will continue to unfold, the potential for a new symbiotic relationship between in-store activities and digital conveniences to augment each other to a holistic consumer experience leaves lots of room for entrepreneurs and businesses to find their unique place in this evolving landscape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Scrapping the Roadmap: Navigating Products Through Change</strong>, a BrainStation Digital Leadership event, attracted thousands of professionals around the world eager to understand how brands were managing products and product development in a crisis. </p>



<p>You can watch the panel event here: </p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/421629191" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>Here are some tips on how to navigate product development and management through periods of change. &nbsp;</p>



<h2>Be Able (and Willing) to Change Mindset</h2>



<p>Over the last few months, brands across industries have had to adjust product roadmaps, and they’ve often had to do that at light speed. Maria Potoroczyn, from Citi, explained how COVID-19 forced the company to completely redefine its product roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s May 21st and we’re basically done with what we initially had on our roadmap for 2020. So, we&#8217;ve had to define the path forward from scratch,” she said. </p>



<p>Daryl Porter, from Walmart, described how the company quickly shifted focus to boost its delivery service. </p>



<p>“We rallied the entire organization around building capacity very fast – adding pickers, ramping up delivery infrastructure – there was a lot of operational focus there, and on the digital side we had to make sure we could enable that. We gathered Product Managers and Engineers and brought them all together in a “tiger team” to allow for decisions to be made quickly,” Porter said.</p>



<h2>Focus on Prioritization</h2>



<p>Given the pace of change, prioritization of initiatives has been fundamental to organizations across industries. Michael Ayoola, from The New York Times, explained how the media organization has delayed more experimental initiatives (involving AI and machine learning) to focus on projects that would provide more immediate value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Advertising has taken a hit, so growth and engagement have been the focus,” he said, explaining that The Times has allowed free access to content related to COVID-19, and provided removed paywalls for high school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel agreed on the need for planning flexibility, but Porter added that Walmart has been careful to maintain a long-term lens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We tried not to build functionality that would have no place in a post-COVID world,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Data is King (But Trust Your Instincts)</h2>



<p>Over the last few months, key metrics have shifted and they continue to change. This has increased the importance of remote user testing.</p>



<p>“Drivers of satisfaction have dramatically changed. What was important before isn’t necessarily important now,” Porter said, adding that while data remains essential, not having all the information is okay too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of our decisions are based on 70 percent data and 30 percent instinct – and that&#8217;s okay, Usually we’d be a lot higher on the data side, but by being a little less risk-averse, we were able to do it.”</p>



<p>Potoroczyn explained that despite occasional gaps in data, the last few months have reminded organizations how products and product roadmaps <em>should</em> be managed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been such a tangible example and reaffirmation of some of the great principles of product management: stay close to the customer and in sync with their needs, understand your technical limitations, and make sure you understand the tradeoffs of all the other things you choose not to do,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Project and Product Managers often work hand-in-hand, there are a few more differences between these roles than just two letters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any professional experience, you’ve likely either avoided a Project Manager in the office hallway or desperately sought them out. These individuals play a critical, and often fleeting, role in an organization. Their goal is to steer a specific project through its lifecycle – initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and completion – with an eye towards striking the delicate balance between time, cost, and quality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Managers have a bird’s eye view of a project. They’ve mastered the art of laying out a plan that maps out the timeline and resources needed to bring a project to life, breaks down the budget, identifies and removes roadblocks, and minimizes risks. On top of all of that, Project Managers need to motivate the team through the typical highs and lows that come with project delivery and manage communication with stakeholders of all stripes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Product Manager’s role can be slightly different depending on the organization. For example, some organizations include marketing as a responsibility while others don’t. Ultimately, a Product Manager is responsible for the success of a product from concept to launch to continuous improvement. They determine the what, why, and when of the product that the engineering team then builds out. They communicate this through a product roadmap (more on this further below). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Managers eat, sleep, and breathe the needs of their customers. They’re constantly working to create value for them that’s also aligned to business goals. For this reason, many people describe Product Managers as “mini CEOs” that sit at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience. </span></p>
<h2><b>What Keeps Them Up at Night? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scope creep” might sound like a villain with fresh breath to you, but it’s enough to make a Project Manager’s blood run cold. In reality, it means that the project work that was once agreed upon is now slowing expanding, putting timelines and budget at risk. This is usually because a detail was overlooked, not shared or simply unknown in the initial planning phase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Managers have to nervously laugh through the suggestion that the timeline for the project was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yesterday</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that they only have 80% of the resources required to get it done. They also have to constantly grapple with stakeholder expectations that may differ, and in some cases, conflict.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar vein, changes in corporate strategy can upend even the most carefully planned product roadmap. Like Project Managers, Product Managers have to contend with the often messy politics of stakeholder disagreements. It’s their goal to rally an organization around a single product vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s really the two C’s that have the power to rob a Product Manager of a good night’s sleep: competition and customers. A new startup on the block might directly compete or (gasp!) launch an awesome substitute to your product. Not to mention there’s always the potential that customer demand can fall flat after spending months on development. </span></p>
<h2><b>What are Their Deliverables?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer to this lies in each of their titles. A Project Manager delivers a complete project, while a Product Manager delivers a usable product. The difference here being that a product isn’t “complete” in the same way a project is once it’s launched. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Managers own:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project plan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A detailed document that includes scope, timeline, resources, and costs that maps out the optimal path to project completion.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Stakeholder communication:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This can be something as simple as an email or as detailed as a presentation, but typically outlines progress and next steps.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project handover:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> All of the documents and artifacts needed for the next or future teams to operate and maintain the outcome of a project (ie. a new product). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Post-mortem:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A report or presentation that explains what went well and what didn’t. It’s meant to help future Project Managers better predict obstacles and identify helpful shortcuts. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Managers own: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Product strategy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A document outlining the vision of the product that includes how the product will evolve, how it will get there and why it’ll be successful with customers. The customer’s needs must have a starring role in this document. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Product roadmap:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The roadmap is a visual representation of how your product will evolve over time. It helps ensure that even the smallest tasks roll up to the grander goal. It used to prioritize tasks, coordinate teams and track overall progress. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Product backlog/user stories</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This is essentially a working list of things to be done during product development from the perspective of the user. The product manager is constantly maintaining the backlog. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Product analytics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Once the product is launched, a Product Manager monitors its usage, analytics, and customer feedback to look for areas of improvement or new opportunity.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Skills Needed to Get the Job Done</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be a successful project or Product Manager, you need to have a good mix of hard skills and soft skills. The table below lists some of the typical skills needed to get the job done, but it shouldn’t be considered exhaustive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical thinking</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that a Project Manager needs to have keen time management and <a href="https://www.coursecompare.ca/courses/subject/project-management-courses/">organizational skills</a>. They have to keep themselves and the team on track, monitor progress, and tweak as the project unfolds. When things go awry &#8211; and they almost always do &#8211; Project Managers need to act quickly and creatively to solve problems to avoid derailing the entire project. They need to exhibit leadership skills by setting goals for the team, keeping them motivated, and removing any obstacles that get in their way or threaten the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Project Manager needs to be diplomatic. They should feel comfortable negotiating with executives, stakeholders and members of the project team. Anything from added constraints to personality clashes fall within their jurisdiction. Finally, communication is paramount. Stakeholders expect to be updated on project status clearly and in a timely fashion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Managers need to have empathy and an acute awareness of the needs of their customers. Their creativity takes the wheel when it’s time to brainstorm solutions to the problems they’ve identified, and storytelling comes in handy when rallying a team around a product vision. Like Project Managers, Product Managers also need to be able to solve problems as they arise.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having at least an understanding of technical skills like programming and UX design can be the “Rosetta Stone” to speaking the language of the product team. You don’t necessarily need to write code or design a hi-fi prototype (depending on the specific role), but you should be able to translate more technical aspects of your product to the less technical parties involved. When it comes to analytics though, it’s really important that Product Managers have the ability to draw insights from data to determine future iterations and drive decision making. </span></p>
<h2><b>How They Work Together</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a company spots an opportunity to launch a new product. As mentioned earlier, a Product Manager would put a lot of legwork into determining the what, why and when of the product ahead of its development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Project Manager might enter the picture when it’s time to start bringing this product to life. Both the product and Project Manager help determine the when, but the Project Manager influences the how and by whom. Once the product is launched, and all parties celebrate, a Project Manager steps back while the Product Manager prepares for the next iteration. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, a Product Manager (PM) is responsible for overseeing product development from conception to completion. They help figure out what products should get made, ensure that they do get made, and report back on how users are responding to those products.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">product management, PMs are the glue that holds together the user experience, the technical requirements, and the business requirements of a product. Mind the Product co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Erikkson has described them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “the unsung heroes of the tech world.” </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, PMs can be very well compensated: Indeed claims the average salary for a Product Manager is just over $100,000, while Glassdoor puts it at roughly $$113,000.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-7181 size-full"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/image1.png" alt="product manager" class="wp-image-7181"/><figcaption><a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erikkson, 2011</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>What is Product Management?</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than ever before, <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/product-management#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_WhatDoesaProductManagerDo">savvy product management</a> can have a huge impact on company success. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the digital product world of tremendous consumer choice, low switching costs, social sharing, ratings, reviews, and recommendations, making great products matters more than ever to keep a user’s attention,” </span><a href="https://medium.com/@tworetzky/what-does-a-product-manager-do-205b40d82da3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says Brett Tworetzsky, SVP Product at InVision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand the scope of product management, consider the maturity of the company. If it’s an early-stage start-up, a PM will likely be responsible for everything required to get the product out the door, from research to QA to writing up release notes. If the company is seasoned or multinational, there will be many PMs working on a narrower band of the product’s development. Some PMs, for example, may specialize in collecting and analyzing user feedback while others will facilitate the technical development of the product. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Product Manager’s degree of decision-making power also depends on the size and culture of the company. In large tech firms, executives typically decide what products get made, while PMs are in charge of the user research and execution phases.</span></p>



<h2>What Does a Product Manager do?</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, they “own the Job-to-be-Done,” </span><a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/qa-what-does-a-product-manager-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as Geoffrey Keating puts it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. PMs are passionate about understanding their users’ problems and needs, and they rely on a deep user experience understanding when working with their research, technical, and marketing teams. PMs also cultivate a comprehensive understanding of the product’s strengths and weaknesses, always maintaining a desire for improvement. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This role has both internal-facing and external-facing aspects, and requires a mix of:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management</span></li></ul>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While PMs are managing the development of a product, they are also managing</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in order to accomplish the end goal. Keating jokes that a possible equivalent title is “Direction and Consensus Manager.” If you think about the steps it takes to create a digital product, from brainstorming to widespread user-adoption, you’ll appreciate just how much collaboration is needed.</span></p>



<h2>What are the Skills of a Product Manager?</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PMs must be versatile enough to work at the intersection of UX, Business, and Tech. They need a blend of “big picture” and detail-oriented skills, must be creative as well as analytical in their thinking, and feel comfortable interacting with people </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology. &nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tworetzsky identifies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six skill subsets, roughly corresponding to the different phases of development: </span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Strategic thinking</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">brainstorming, structuring thinking, driving strategy, becoming a go-to expert</span></i></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing and providing presentations and emails, interpersonal engagement</span></i></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Collaboration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading and participating in meetings, solving problems, diffusing team member conflicts</span></i></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Technical</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing scenarios, performing analytics, building prototypes, knowing Search Engine Optimization</span></i></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Detail orientation and QA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: &nbsp;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">writing clear functional specifications, catching mistakes and recovering from errors, delivering on time, navigating options, achieving outcomes</span></i></li><li><b>Empathy/User science</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">interviewing, prototyping, using analytical tools, understanding and representing needs, synthesizing results</span></i></li></ul>



<h2>How do I Become a Product Manager?</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people migrate to product management jobs mid-career. In fact, according to the 2019 BrainStation Digital Skills Survey,&nbsp;<span class="highlight-number">88 percent</span>&nbsp;of Product Managers started their careers in a different field.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior roles in marketing, engineering, business analysis, or general management provide viable pathways, although typically, a PM will have a solid foundation in at least one of three areas (UX, tech, or business). </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the jump into a role as a Product Manager, it’s helpful to build a portfolio that can demonstrate your technical abilities. Core competencies include developing an understanding of Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to build technology products and learning how to ideate and test your minimum viable product. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and virtual reality </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these are some of the trends Product Managers expect will have an impact on their field in the next decade according to BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/product-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, Product Managers turn ideas into reality. They’re responsible for leading the team that creates, distributes, delivers, and solves problems as a product comes to life. As we’ve written about, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-does-a-product-manager-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Managers are “the unsung heroes of the tech world.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we’re profiling four Product Managers who are leading the way in the growing fields of robotics, machine learning, virtual reality, and blockchain. Here’s what they’re working on and how they’re paving the way for new technology.</span></p>



<p><b>Erin Teague &#8211; YouTube&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Teague</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wants you to get up close and personal with a band of gorillas, or experience a live concert without leaving your living room. That’s because Teague is YouTube’s Head of Product for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Digital Skills Survey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just over 10 percent of product management professionals have experience in VR and AR, which&nbsp;</span>makes&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teague a leader in a small but <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/product-management#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_4trailblazingPMs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing field of product management</a>.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the time this (VR and AR) was this crazy thing. Our team was just starting, it was&nbsp; not even clear what this meant,” said Teague at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Product Leader Summit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted by Spero Ventures.</span></p>



<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m6lfbgSMMOk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teague joined YouTube in 2016, and the company launched YouTube’s VR app that same year. Since then, she has continued to lead development on a product that demands constant change, as VR tools and technology are developed.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The technology is going to continue to evolve, what mattered a year ago probably won’t be true today,” said Teague. “VR is still very early, but we believe the future is bright.” &nbsp;</span></p>



<h3><b>Donna Romer &#8211; IBM Watson AI</b></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image size-medium wp-image-8854"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Donna-Romer-300x300.jpeg" alt="Donna Romer, IBM Watson AI" class="wp-image-8854" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Donna-Romer-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Donna-Romer-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Donna-Romer-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Donna-Romer-109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Donna-Romer-100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption>Donna Romer, IBM Watson AI</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked which trends will change product development over the next five-to-ten years, more than 80 percent of respondents said artificial intelligence (AI) will have an impact</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donna Romer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vice President of Product for IBM Watson AI, is sure to agree. As the leader of the team that delivers Watson’s AI, Romer is part of a small but growing group of AI Product Managers, and she recently wrote about what that means on </span><a href="https://medium.com/@donnabella/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-ai-product-manager-d67dc97da2e1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As (Product Managers) we like to start with drawing out the UX, but really, don’t start with wireframes. Instead, AI (Product Managers) first create/collect a data set that represents the problem space. Only then do they ask an Engineer to iterate on the problem to deliver 90 percent accuracy for the problem to be solved,” wrote Romer. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romer goes on to list questions AI Product Managers should be asking when starting a project, and it should come as no surprise that each question mentions data: Did you collect data first? Is your data different? Are you always looking for new data?</span></p>



<h3><b>Ajit Kulkarni &#8211; Chronicled</b></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image size-full wp-image-8855"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ajit.jpeg" alt="Ajit Kulkarni, Chronicled" class="wp-image-8855" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ajit.jpeg 200w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ajit-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ajit-109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ajit-100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption>Ajit Kulkarni, Chronicled</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajit Kulkarni</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leads product at Chronicled, a tech company using blockchain and IoT to power supply chain solutions. He believes that product management in this space is not unlike other products. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to understand the landscape and know how every team working on the product interacts with each other. This principle is helpful for managing any product, especially a product that uses new technologies such as the blockchain where the speed of change is tremendous,” </span><a href="https://blog.chronicled.com/what-its-really-like-to-be-a-product-manager-in-the-blockchain-industry-e23f843acc2b"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says Kulkarni</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to understanding the technology behind blockchain (he says it’s essential to understand full-stack solutions), Kulkarni emphasizes the importance of interpersonal skills to be able to communicate effectively with Engineers, Executives, and customers. He also stresses that Product Managers working in blockchain need to be consistently learning. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll always have more to do and more to learn. That’s just a fact. But it’s where most of the excitement lies for a Product Manager in the blockchain field,” says Kulkarni.</span></p>



<h3><b>Danielle Thé &#8211; Wattpad</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danielle Thé thinks machine learning will become part of every business in the future. She’s the Product Manager for Machine Learning at Wattpad, the social storytelling platform that’s using </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lilyrugo/2019/01/30/wattpads-new-book-publishing-branch-uses-machine-deep-learning-to-find-stories/#3dafce167bf8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Story DNA”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to identify trends and predict bestsellers or the next blockbuster.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that we’ll see a movement towards Data Science that is similar to what happened with the Internet. In the early days, only some businesses believed they needed to be online  —  now every business is online in one way or another,” wrote Thé</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a recent </span><a href="https://medium.com/@daniellethe/my-new-strategy-for-learning-data-science-47625c856abb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about her experience learning Python as a Product Manager. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thé</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is also passionate about making the digital world easy to understand. More than 9,000 people are subscribed to her YouTube channel featuring videos about topics like SQL, web cookies, and of course, machine learning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rh9t8CKqi-c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></figure>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe companies who don’t leverage their data will fall behind those who do. With Data Science, its practices and principles will soon become so foundational to almost any role in business, marketing, product, or government,” says Thé.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/product-management#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowToGetAjobAsAProductmanager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product Managers</a> are increasingly important to the product development process and have been called the “unsung heroes of the tech world,&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">glue that binds user experience with technical and business requirements,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and the new dream job for MBA students. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a Product Manager was most likely involved in the creation of your favorite product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out how to land a job in this fast-rising field, we spoke to a number of Senior Product Managers. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Managers Need to Commit to Continuous Learning</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some jobs require a specific, tailored education path (read: you’re not becoming a brain surgeon without going to medical school).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product management is the opposite. Across North America, Product Managers come from a variety of backgrounds, including degrees in communications, marketing, and engineering, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s no undergrad degree you take, and then you become a Product Manager,” notes Nahla Salem, a Senior Product Manager at Loopio, an RFP response software. “You need to be strategic and plan out your career in a way that leads to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, this strategic plan involves continuing education. According to a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey of 2,500 Product Managers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 71 percent of respondents held at least one professional certification in addition to an undergrad degree, and 76 percent considered continuing education very or somewhat important to their career. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are good reasons for this focus on continuous learning: the best Product Managers often have to know more about their industry than anybody else in the company. On top of that, they’ll need to be able to speak the language of Developers, Engineers, Designers, Marketers, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They wear many hats, using a broad knowledge base to make trade-off decisions, and bring together cross-functional teams, ensuring alignment between diverse functions,” management consulting firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey once wrote</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adding that “product management is emerging as the new training ground for future tech CEOs.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Industry and Develop a Diverse Skill Set </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most PMs agree on one thing: It’s not an entry-level job. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the skills a good PM requires — management abilities, problem-solving, cross-functional teamwork, and decision-making — come from experience in the workplace. Fittingly, according to the 2019 BrainStation Digital Skills Survey,  over 80 percent of product respondents are working in an intermediate or higher position level. What&#8217;s more, <span class="highlight-number">88 percent</span> of product management professionals started their careers in a different field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;ll hear a lot of PMs say they were doing the job of a PM long before they had the job title,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillip Gornicki, a Senior Technical Product Manager at Rubikloud. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s because leadership and interpersonal skills play such a vital role in product management.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Yee, Head of Product at Rangle, a Digital Transformation Consultancy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says landing a role in product management involves gaining a sense of several main areas: Business, technology, and customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Product Manager is trying to understand where those three intersect&#8230; to build a really great product,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is good news for those looking to make a career change; the role requires a number of transferable skills, with being able to work cross-functionally among the most important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You need to be able to understand how to work with technical people, how to work with internal stakeholders, to really be able to move a product along,” says  Kim Phelan, VP of Product at ChefHero, an app that allows businesses to easily order wholesale restaurant supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also helpful to have a solid sense of industry trends and customer needs, Phelan adds — along with the problem-solving savvy to develop something people will want to buy, use, and support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just like education, the skill set needed for PM roles vary widely company by company, says Gornicki</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s important to be very deliberate about your search and the types of companies you&#8217;re applying for,” he says. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network Your Way to the Top</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you’ll find Product Manager roles all over online job boards — they’re a dime a dozen on LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and even a quick Google search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But PMs say networking inside or outside of your own company, be it inviting a colleague you admire out for coffee or attending a mentorship event, can be a better bet than applying cold to a job posting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Networking is, to me, the number one thing to do &#8230; if you don&#8217;t go to the meetups, if you don&#8217;t actively find the right mentor and get critical advice on where your resume or job experience is weak, you&#8217;ll find it hard,” says Jack Sadler, Director of Product Management at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rangle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phelan agrees, saying there are lots of solid meetups for budding PMs — like the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto Product Management Association meetup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Mana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ement New York</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Generally, when I&#8217;ve hired before, it&#8217;s been internally or people with experience,” she adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line is that while making industry connections and diversifying your skillset will help set you apart, there’s no singular route to landing a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don&#8217;t need a cookie-cutter path to product management to be a successful product manager,” says Gornicki.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thisisproductmanagement.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>This is Product Management</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an audience of 15,000 weekly listeners and 200-plus episodes in the archive, this informative podcast is perfect for anyone who wants a show that maintains a tight focus on product management.</span></p>
<p><iframe style="border: solid 1px #dedede;" src="https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/62480/63019632" width="220" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean that host Mike Fishbein’s show lacks variety. In fact, interviewees come from all sorts of industries and their discussions – which rarely clock in above the half-hour mark – cover everything including arts, science, user experience, strategy, career tips, design, differentiation, and metrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular episodes of the year found Sandra Lin, Senior Product Director for Northwestern Mutual, exploring how the company evolved to offer digital experiences, while another episode found Karen O’Leonard, Head of Innovation at Willis Towers Watson, sharing how she implemented a testing and learning approach with her team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to sift through the show’s archive, its website helpfully allows you to sort episodes by topic, company size, audience, and industry.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/framework/id1373741352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framework</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by designers Rob Hayes and Tom Creighton, Framework is “a podcast about the process of researching, planning, and building that goes into bringing a product to market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The podcast recently interviewed Jason Field, BrainStration&#8217;s Founder and CEO. The episode focused on the design and development of Synapse, BrainStation’s unique, data-driven student learning platform. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/synapse-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click here to learn more about Synapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><a href="http://rocketship.fm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Rocketship.fm</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billed as essential listening for entrepreneurs, Product Managers and anyone working in tech, Rocketship.fm is a rare tech podcast to divide its episodes – which now number 300 – into “seasons” as well as small series focused on a single topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the show’s ongoing seventh season featured a series called “Blockland” that took a penetrating look at the movement to remake Cleveland as the blockchain capital of the world. Beyond fascinating episodes focusing on the city specifically – including the surprising role a local car salesman played in Cleveland’s tech transformation – the season also featured an episode on the history of blockchain, an interview with Wikipedia Co-Founder Larry Sanger about Everipedia, and an installment focusing on Blockland’s naysayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other recent interview guests include Homebrew Founder and Partner Hunter Walk, Product Maestro Chief Storyteller Connie Kwan, and UserVoice CEO Richard White.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://thisweekinstartups.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>This Week in Startups</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising the most interesting, outrageous and illuminating stories from the world of entrepreneurship, this popular show – available in both audio and video formats – is the pod of choice for product professionals who want to keep a finger pressed to the pulse of the wider tech world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Calacanis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an angel investor, an early benefactor from the dot-com boom, and a “podcast pioneer” who has issued nearly 1,000 episodes of this 10-year-old podcast. Given his clout, it’s no surprise Calacanis attracts some heavy-hitting guests. Recently, he’s welcomed co-founders and CEOs of companies including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MasterClass</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HackerOne, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canva</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/660368612&amp;color=ff5500" width="100%" height="166" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there is a lot to dig into here for product professionals. Try a recent episode featuring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TripActions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Co-Founder and CEO Ariel Cohen discussing the art of finding product-market fit, or dig into a December interview featuring former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brandless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO and Co-Founder Tina Sharkey sharing how to create products that reflect the values of consumers, not brands.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/radio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Product Hunt Radio</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re already obsessed with scanning the latest and coolest in tech on Product Hunt, why not check out this podcast co-hosted by the website’s founder, Ryan Hoover, and Abadesi Osunsade?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With guests spanning Journalists, Investors, and Founders, this podcast regularly features deep dives into some pretty big topics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, for instance, Osunsade tackled hustle culture and crisis management with Alex Konrad, Senior Associate Editor at Forbes, while Compassionate Coding Founder April Wensel hopped on the week before to discuss how the tech industry can become more compassionate and inclusive.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>a16z</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It probably goes without saying that the partners at a16z – the short-hand for Andreessen Horowitz, one of the world’s top VC firms – know their stuff, and anyone in tech could benefit from their considerable wisdom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/users/62921190&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With multiple installments per week, a rotating cast of hosts – sometimes including Andreessen Horowitz Founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz – tackle a broad range of topics based loosely around the thesis that software is “eating the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product professionals would be well-served by a May episode in which general partner David Ulevitch – Founder of OpenDNS and EveryDNS – shared advice on pricing and packaging and finding a balance between the product visionary and the product manager. Or try a January show featuring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileIron</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Tinker</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survival to Thrival</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the group discusses how enterprise B2B companies are challenged by finding the right go-to-market fit. </span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>How I Built This</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tremendously popular in and outside the world of tech, Guy Raz’s entertaining exploration of the stories behind some of the world’s top companies makes for a podcast you can throw on when you have someone in the car who doesn’t know anything about product management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it’s accessible, it’s also an incredibly insightful show offering no shortage of lessons into how some of the world’s most ubiquitous products and companies came to be.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="NPR embedded audio player" src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/747660923/747710084" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one recent highlight episode, Jen Rubio of Away shared the story of how a broken suitcase led her to create a company now valued at $1.4 billion, while another illuminating installment looked at how Whitney Wolfe Herd’s experience suing Tinder for sexual harassment – and the cyber-bullying that ensued – prompted her to launch Bumble, the dating app where women make the first move. Another popular episode explored how Chip Wilson noticed the rising popularity of yoga in the late 1990s ultimately led to the multimillion-dollar brand lululemon.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/the-pitch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Pitch</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deemed the “best business podcast on startup life” by Fortune Magazine, this show promises to take listeners behind the curtain to hear real entrepreneurs pitch real investors for real money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosted by Josh Muccio, the show offers insight into how investors think, how entrepreneurs successfully sell their product ideas, and how major business deals can blossom from a simple conversation.</span></p>
<p><iframe style="border-radius: 3px; height: 130px; width: 100%; box-shadow: 0 0 25px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);" src="https://player.gimletmedia.com/z3hgv4" width="100%" height="130" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to check out a June episode titled “Does Anyone Really Want Your Product,” in which Dennis Meng pitches four investors on his company User Interviews – a user research system for teams of any size – or an April podcast featuring the Founders of the boxing workout startup, Hykso.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://productinnovationeducators.com/tei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Everyday Innovator </b></a></h2>
<p>Hosted by experienced Product Manager Chad McAllister, PhD, The Everyday Innovator was created in the style of a lesson plan help listeners develop product management skills. Episodes, which are organized into four skill levels, are meant to be instructive in nature, with the goal of turning listeners into &#8220;product management masters.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Management has been getting a lot of attention lately, and for good reason –&nbsp;often called the ‘mini-CEOs’ of product, Product Managers (PMs) have a unique yet critical role in many organizations. What’s interesting about PMs is that most come from diverse professional backgrounds, in fact, The Digital Skills Survey found that </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/product-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">88 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of product professionals started their careers in a different field.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out more about the role of Product Manager and what sets apart successful products, BrainStation held a Product Management Panel at our New York City Campus last week, which featured panelists from The Wing, Spotify, and Oscar Health. Here is a recap of some of the things they had to say.</span></p>



<h2><b>What Does a PM Do?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its rise in popularity, (Product Manager is now listed as one of LinkedIn’s most </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/product-manager-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">promising jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) many people still don’t have a clear understanding of what a product management role entails. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, the role of Product Manager means you are responsible for every stage of the product development, from ideation to release, and beyond. Depending on the organization, industry, and type of product, the details of a PM role will vary. Our panelists confirmed this – as all are working for different organizations, occupying different industries, and creating products for different users.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m responsible for helping to build </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the overall website experience as well as the infrastructure that powers the site, the CMS, and all of the analytics,” said Erica Tsai, Product Consultant at The Wing, a female-only coworking space. “So I help to plan releases, and work with our development team and Designers.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a Product Area Lead on our creator side of the business – essentially our supply side,” explained Justin Belmont, Senior Product Manager at Spotify. “We have a product called Spotify for Artists where we give them insights about who’s listening, what other artists they listen to, and in what contexts they’re listening.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belmont went on to highlight that not all products are aimed at consumers. “My role includes building a lot of B2B tools – we have tools for major labels, management companies, and publishers. So building this suite of products that we have on the creator side of spotify.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from B2C and B2B products, many PMs also work on internal products that help teams within the organization perform better. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I work with a team of about 8 engineers, two designers, and we build internal tools for our customer service team,” said Amanda Durham, Product Manager at Oscar Health.</span></p>



<h2><b>The Product Management Process</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you’ve heard of </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/agile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a process for software development that is based on an iterative approach. Many organizations, particularly those involved in technology, use Agile Methodologies in their digital product development. We asked our panelists about their process, and how they approach building products to ensure their success.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Oscar Health, they focus on the user to drive their product development. “What we do is make sure we’re tackling the right problem,” said Durham. “Often you might think you know the problem, but you have to really sit down with your users and make sure you’re tackling the right things.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do this through shadowing, 1:1 interviews, or group user research sessions.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how do you know if the products you’re building are the right ones? Erica Tsai shared her strategy: </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to always be working on things where the impact is greater than the effort. And sometimes things are necessary and that’s not the case, but I think it’s a good testing ground for everyone to sit down and talk about.” </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin Belmont explained that the important thing is to define the problem that the product is going to solve for. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At a larger company, there’s a lot of focus on process,” said Belmont. “We use OKRs (objectives and key results) at every level of the organization. OKRs are a really good tool because they don’t specify how you’re going to solve the problem, but they specify the outcomes that you’re driving towards.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re doing Agile correctly,” Belmont added. “You should be getting feedback all the time.”</span></p>



<h2><b>The Future of Product Management</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, products are impacted, and it’s important for professionals working in the product space to stay in the know about new technologies and trends. We asked our product experts to share what they think the future of product management holds. Across the board, there was talk about artificial intelligence and data. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the future is going to be a much more customized experience for your user based on data and insights that you’re getting,” said Tsai. “I think that having comfort with data analytics will be critical.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for managing products that incorporate new technologies, it’s a difficult position to be in as a PM. You want to ensure that you have a solid comprehension of the technical side of things so that you can better manage the people who are experts in the topic – in the case of AI this might be the engineers. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AI is something that is really interesting from a product perspective because you’re not necessarily the expert in AI, but you’re in charge of defining the problems, making sure you have the right training data set, and establishing what level of risk you are willing to take on in the AI product you provide to consumers,” Durham explained.</span></p>



<h2><b>What it Takes to be Successful</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the board, our panelists explained that being successful in a product management role requires a technical understanding, strong leadership qualities, and the ability to communicate cross-functionally to move teams toward a common goal. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think in the early days of Product management, it was just folks with computer science or engineering degrees that were learning the business side,” said Belmont. “It’s changed quite a bit and it’s increasingly becoming people who can communicate and get teams excited about a vision while working across the organization.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The position of Product Manager has been one of the fastest-growing roles in tech in recent years, with a 30 percent growth in job openings year over year. LinkedIn even recently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it as one of the most promising jobs – in all industries.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, companies are seeing the value in hiring product gurus who can oversee and guide a product’s life development from ideation to market, all while efficiently managing teams of drastically diverse backgrounds and developing a sound distribution plan.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble is, candidates who possess the varied skill set needed for Product Management are elusive and highly sought-after. Here are some tips on how to hire&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Product Manager (PM) who will be the perfect fit for your team.</span></p>



<h3><b>Do Some Soul-Searching</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before posting the job, talk to your fellow stakeholders about what your dream Product Manager’s role will look like.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Product Management is fundamentally a white space role, so the skills you need will depend on what skills you already have and what your company does,” </span><a href="https://medium.com/@jackiebo/how-to-hire-great-product-managers-f07a3c9337ea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jackie Bavaro, Head of Product Management at Asana. “It’s best to do this with the people who will be working with the PM and interviewing the PM, so that they’ll all be aligned.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“PMs do best when the team they’re joining really wants them there.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you need someone with an uncanny design eye, or razor-sharp technical skills, or deep experience in analytics?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’d probably love to find all of those qualities in the same candidate, but there aren’t too many of those people around.</span></p>



<h3><b>The Personality Test</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With some roles, especially in tech, so-called “soft skills” are often regarded as just one of many factors to consider when evaluating a job candidate. With Product Managers, however, people skills are paramount.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mini-CEO of your product will need to communicate effectively and efficiently with such a diverse group of people – Engineers, Designers, Analysts, senior business leaders, Distributors, and sales teams – that the candidate’s personality is one of the most important considerations in the hiring process.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And given the categorically collaborative nature of the job, it should be a red flag if your would-be Product Manager takes full credit for all of their past successes.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Jim Patterson, former Chief Product Officer at Yammer and now CEO of cannabis tech startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ze</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even counts the number of times Product Management candidates use the word “I” in their interviews.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People can’t help it,” he </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/why-soldiers-and-chefs-make-the-best-product-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I’ve been in interviews where someone says ‘I’ 50 times – ‘I did this, I did that.’ They came from a big company. There’s no way they did all of that alone.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue isn’t just that this candidate might be taking undue ownership of other people’s work – although that isn’t a good sign. But a good Product Manager will know how to empower a broadly skilled team, and that won’t happen if your PM is trying to do everything on their own.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re younger, you want so much to be the hero of the product, and you care deeply about your product. But what can happen is that you take too much on yourself, and you don’t realize the value that other people can bring to the table,” </span><a href="https://www.productplan.com/product-lessons-learned-julie-cabinaw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Julie Cabinaw, former VP of Sales &amp; Marketing Technology &amp; Innovation at Scentsy, now Chief Reinvention Officer with the state of North Dakota.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You think you have to do it all yourself. You’re not inclusive enough, and in the end, you don’t create a product that is as good as you could have created, had you allowed those people to be a part of it. It’s often a matter of ego.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What ends up happening is that you prove you can build something pretty good all by yourself,” she added, “but you could have created something much bigger and much better if you had some other input.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And product management is a role where a bit of persuasive ability goes a long way.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look for charisma in PM candidates, the genuine sort that a person has when they are good at communicating (both speaking and listening), make the people around them look good, and have a high degree of empathy for the users of their product,” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-hire-really-good-product-managers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nick Nguyen, Vice-President of Product Strategy with Mozilla.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not coincidentally, these are the people that others root for, admire, and wish to succeed.”</span></p>



<h3><b>What Skills to Look For</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-skills-does-a-product-manager-need" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the skills a Product Manager needs to be successful, but it’s possible your organization might not need someone who checks quite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">those boxes.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some skills, let’s say, are pretty much required across the board for Product Managers. Your PM, for example, should possess a strong understanding of Scrum, the Agile methodology, and project management frameworks, they should know how to define a Minimum Viable Product, perform market assessments, and understand how to present a product solution to stakeholders.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, Todd Jackson, Founder in Residence at First Round Capital and former VP of Product and Design at Dropbox, separates Product Management skills into three categories: must-have, good-to-have, and “bonus.” He has four qualities in the must-have column: outstanding intellect, excellent communication, demonstrated leadership, and collaboration skills within the company culture.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He categorizes technical skills, an analytical background, and an entrepreneurial spirit as “good to have,” while the ability to write code or run a quantitative analysis is merely a bonus.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never seen a truly great Product Manager that did not have all four qualities in the must-have column,” he </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/find-vet-and-close-the-best-product-managers-heres-how/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s important to look for diverse experiences and backgrounds. Your users and customers are likely a diverse set of people, so your employees should be too. This can actually be a big competitive advantage over other companies that think too rigidly or homogeneously about their hiring.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, according to BrainStation’s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/product-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 88 percent of Product Managers polled began their careers in a different field, a number higher than any other discipline.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it does make sense to keep an open mind about your Product Manager’s background. In fact, Patterson even </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/why-soldiers-and-chefs-make-the-best-product-managers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that chefs and soldiers make the best Product Managers because of their ability to work under pressure.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In those scenarios – and even with seasoned Product Managers – an ongoing commitment to education is another thing to look for. In BrainStation’s survey,&nbsp;71 percent of Product Managers reported participating in workshops, roughly 65 percent in both online and in-person courses, and 55 percent in webinars.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the processes and specific skills of PMing can be taught to someone with the right potential. It’s easy to teach factual information and tools,” Bavaro said. “On the other hand, I don’t think mindsets and what types of information you notice can be picked up quickly on the job.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On this list, I put: customer empathy, awareness of good design, product intuition, product mindset, learning mindset, perseverance, collaborating well with people, effective communication, detail oriented, and grasping complex concepts quickly.”</span></p>



<h3><b>Interview Questions</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Product Management sits at the nexus of technology, business, and user experience, you should be sure to include questions that probe your would-be PM’s understanding of each. Here are some examples:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s a product that you think features excellent design, and why do you appreciate its design?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell me about a time when there was a disagreement between Engineers and Designers on a product you were working on, and how did you resolve it?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What area of product management do you feel you’re weakest in?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you communicate a product requirement for your engineering team?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s your method for validating ideas with customers?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a hypothetical scenario: you have a product you strongly believe in that simply isn’t finding any success. What do you do?</span></li></ul>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bavaro says her team at Asana likes to use take-home assignments early in the process, but she acknowledges that they have lost candidates who didn’t want to complete them. Jackson, meanwhile, recommends bringing candidates in for a panel presentation.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to gather a sense of a candidate’s soft skills can be a little tricky, but Bavaro has an interesting strategy: she makes sure to inject a little bit of friction into the interview to see how her Product Manager handles it.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make sure that you push back on at least one idea of theirs during design questions,” she said. “Ask why they wouldn’t design it a different way and see how open they are to your suggestion.”</span></p>



<h3><b>Closing the Deal</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the aforementioned worldwide demand for Product Managers, it’s probably obvious that you won’t be able to lure a top-flight candidate without a solid salary; Hired’s 2017&nbsp;</span><a href="https://hired.com/state-of-salaries-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global State of Tech Salaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;survey found that Product Managers’ average salary of $138,000 was the very highest of any tech role.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the competitive market for Product Management talent makes it necessary to go above-and-beyond in other ways, too.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While you’re interviewing the PM, remember they’re also interviewing you to see if they’d want to work at your company,” Bavaro pointed out. “Treat your candidate experience like a product and look for ways to make it easy and enjoyable.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One tip I’ve learned for selling candidates on the role – first ask them what they’re looking for in their next role, then focus your pitch on the things they care about.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the best way to find your ideal Product Manager might be to think like a Product Manager.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like to think about the reward centers in the PM brain,” Jackson said. “There are several big ones I can think of: having impact, delighting users, sense of purpose/mission, having autonomy, getting recognition, financial outcomes, learning/growth, etc. In my experience, more than other disciplines, PMs tend to care most about impact and autonomy.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you can honestly describe to them how they’ll get the reward they want most, you’ll close some great candidates. Just make sure you deliver on whatever you promised. The only thing more important than hiring the best PMs is keeping them.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Managers have the enviable job of taking a product from its roots as an idea and steering its lifecycle through launch and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “mini-CEOs” of a product, these specialists must possess a wide variety of skills and competencies to propel a product to success. It’s no wonder Product Managers are so well-compensated; Hired’s 2017 </span><a href="https://hired.com/state-of-salaries-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global State of Tech Salaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survey found that Product Managers’ average salary of $138,000 was the very highest of any tech role. Unsurprisingly, LinkedIn now lists Product Manager as one of the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/product-manager-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most promising jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, s these roles saw a 30 percent year-over-year growth rate in job openings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that sounds appealing, here are some of the skills needed to break into and thrive in this rapidly growing role.</span></p>

<p><b>Personal Skills Are Essential for Product Managers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/product-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 88 percent of Product Managers polled began their careers in a different field, a number higher than any other discipline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense then that the most crucial skills for Product Managers are intangible people skills – otherwise known as soft skills, but we’ll discuss that later – which tend to be more transferable from position to position and industry to industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In BrainStation’s survey, Product Managers ranked communication (71 percent), leadership (65 percent), and empathy (58 percent) as the most important skills for a Product Manager, ahead of research and project management, and far ahead of design (selected by only 20 percent of respondents).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also found that 62 percent of respondents worked on teams of 10 or fewer, and collaboration is a constant; in fact, Product Managers polled reported that collaboration was the second-most time-consuming function of their job, behind only developing specs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I wish somebody had told me when I started working as a Product Manager is: ‘Don’t be a hero,’” </span><a href="https://medium.com/on-human-centric-systems/the-past-and-future-of-product-management-79db51fc1549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Matt LeMay, Partner at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sudden Compass</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Self-styled ‘visionary’ Product Managers are dangerous – which is why I advise against hiring PM candidates who fire off (Steve Jobs) quotes during job interviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Product management is fundamentally about making connections and creating understanding across different roles, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about telling people what to do. It’s a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">supportive </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">role, not a visionary role.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, BrainStation’s survey found that the most-used tools for brainstorming and ideation among Product Managers do not require a high degree of technical expertise: whiteboarding sessions (66 percent) and pen-and-paper (53 percent) were most popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the emphasis on “soft” skills, it’s possible Product Managers are looking to professional development to fill in the gaps in their skill sets. 71 percent of Product Managers reported participating in workshops, roughly 65 percent in both online and in-person courses, and 55 percent in webinars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the emotional intelligence – or “EQ” – that seems so crucial to a good Product Manager is much harder to teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EQ is more important (than IQ),” </span><a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/perspectives/product-management-stories-sam-lessin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sam Lessin, former VP of Product Management at Facebook. “Product Managers get huge value from being highly empathetic with a team, not just with users. There are plenty of smart people, but not enough with EQ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never successfully trained empathy, so you have to hire for it.” </span></p>
<p><b>Technical Skills for Product Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A question that comes up often among would-be Product Managers is: “how technical do I have to be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lulu Cheng, Product Manager at Pinterest, </span><a href="http://www.lulucheng.com/2015/11/28/getting-to-technical-enough-as-a-product-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about what it means to be “technical enough” to perform her role. Ultimately, she determined that all Product Managers should be able to: trace user issues back to the underlying problem; estimate how long different options will take to build; anticipate implementation issues; brainstorm technical solutions; and identify opportunities that arise from new technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a deeper look, some competencies do seem to be a near-requirement across the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of whether a Product Manager needs to know how to code is controversial, but Product Managers should at least learn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">about</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Google, the final stage of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Manager interviews</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires candidates to whiteboard coding questions with a senior engineer on-hand to evaluate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies might not require such a high degree of coding competence, but most agree that in order to communicate effectively with developers and engineers, a Product Manager should have a solid grasp of the fundamentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Product Managers don’t need to be able to write code. But they should be able to speak the technical language of their industry – and translate that language to the less technically inclined,” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-skills-are-needed-to-be-a-product-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Latif Nanji, Co-founder and CEO of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmunk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other technical skills or competencies are similarly viewed as required at most companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An often-shared Venn diagram positions Product Managers at the nexus of technology, business, and user experience – or, as Marty Cagan wrote in his&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">book</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Inspired,&nbsp;the goal of a Product Manager is to “discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It follows, then, that Product Managers are expected to understand data analytics, including product launch metrics, A/B testing, and standard measurement platforms such as Google Analytics. Similarly, all Product Managers should be comfortable drawing out wireframes and evaluating UX. And Product Managers are expected to understand software development lifecycle methodologies, such as the commonly used Agile methodology Scrum. You will also be expected to produce competitive analyses and status reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, experts are emphasizing a shift away from the differentiation between “hard” and “soft” skills. LeMay writes instead about the importance of “connective” skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve often been asked how to balance ‘hard skills’ and ‘soft skills’ when hiring a PM. Frankly, I think this very distinction is often what stops companies from identifying the best potential PMs, and what stops PMs from feeling confident in their work,” he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At its worst, this idea compels companies to hire the candidates who are the most like engineers, not the candidates who will make the best Product Managers,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The differentiating factor between success and failure is not being ‘technical enough,’ but rather being adept at making </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">connections </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">between different sets of values and expertise.”</span></p>
<p><b>A Product Manager Will Depend on Critical Thinking</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the intangible skills we covered, a good Product Manager needs to develop a skill set for curiosity, intellectual rigor, and being able to stay tightly focused on an organization’s broader goals.</span></p>
