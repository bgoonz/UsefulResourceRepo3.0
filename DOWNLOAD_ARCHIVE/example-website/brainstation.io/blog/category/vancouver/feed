								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VANCOUVER, BC &#8212; BrainStation, the global leader in digital skills training, has partnered with BC Tech to create the BC Reskilling program, which aims to help unemployed, underemployed, and transitioning workers learn new skills for new careers in technology. Funding for this training is provided by the Government of Canada, through the Canada-British Columbia Workforce Development Agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the BC Reskilling program, BrainStation will provide individuals in need with cutting-edge digital skills training through its award-winning <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=BCTechReskillPartnership">User Experience (UX) Design</a> and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=BCTechReskillPartnership">Web Development</a> bootcamps. </p>



<p>BrainStation and BC Tech previously partnered in 2020 to offer UX Design and Web Development bootcamps to unemployed and underemployed BC residents. This initiative resulted in 55 students finding work within six months of graduation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“BrainStation’s mission is to empower individuals with digital skills that launch or accelerate their careers. We are excited to be BC Tech’s training partner on their latest initiative to invest in digital skill training as part of BC’s economic recovery,” said Kyle Treleaven, Vice President and General Manager at BrainStation Vancouver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vancouver’s tech sector continues to grow, with a number of unicorn companies – such as  Thinkific, Clio, Dapper Labs, Abcellera, and Galvanize – making their marks on the world’s stage. The sector’s continued growth, however, is reliant on the development of local talent, as there are now more job opportunities than qualified professionals to fill these emerging roles in the workforce.</p>



<p>BrainStation’s bootcamps were designed to help individuals take advantage of exciting new digital careers, with a collaborative, project-based learning experience, and curriculum updated in real-time, ensuring students always learn cutting-edge, in-demand skills that can be applied in a real-world setting. Since 2012, the company has seen over 90% of its graduates find work within 180 days of graduation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It goes without saying that the spread of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on employment, hiring trends, and the world of work in general. While the current “new normal” has been a shrinkage in the workforce, startups in Vancouver’s hot tech market are still growing and hiring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are three great Vancouver tech startups that are hiring right now.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://lumen5.com/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Lumen5</a></h2>

<p>Fresh Prep is a meal kit delivery service that provides pre-portioned, pre-chopped ingredients in reusable cooler bags, and recyclable or compostable packaging options. Launched in 2015, Fresh Prep has grown its customer base by over 200 percent year over year and now has over 250 employees.</p>

Founded by Mikaella Go and Tony Yu through a Kickstarter project (their campaign attracted more than nine thousand backers and 1.2 million dollars pledged), the company has a patented fabric technology, which was designed to withstand Vancouver’s wet, rainy weather –&nbsp;and stay stylish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Totally vegan and sustainably made, the waterproof shoe “functions like a boot, fits like a sock, but looks like a sneaker.” This mix seems to be hit; pre-orders were halted to keep up with the overwhelming demand.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who have been following Vancouver’s tech scene know that the picturesque West Coast city has </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/4-years-in-vancouver-the-rise-of-a-tech-giant"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gradually become a tech hotbed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 2019 was another banner year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we wind down toward the holidays, we thought it was a good time to reflect on the year that was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most important trends and stories from a busy 2019 in Vancouver tech.</span></p>
<h2><b>Government Support Remains Robust</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the Canadian government announced a $700 million investment in the country’s Cleantech industry. That funding disproportionately benefits Vancouver, which is home to 25 percent of Canada’s Cleantech companies. More than 220 companies employ roughly 3,500 people there, and six local companies were named to the 2019 Global Cleantech 100 (including General Fusion, the utility-scale fusion power developer that has secured $127 million in funding).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That support for Cleantech continued in 2019 when the federal government announced a $50 million investment in venture capital for Canadian Cleantech companies. The investments are being matched by the private sector and will contribute up to $1.5 billion in Canada’s economy. This news comes after the B.C. government similarly committed to spurring Cleantech investment with its CleanBC plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The support from the federal government continued in September when the government announced $353,550 in funding to the Vancouver Economic Commission to develop the Technology Deployment Network – an online platform designed to develop Cleantech solutions – and another $100,000 to promote Vancouver as an e-sports hub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Vancouver is Canada’s fastest-growing and most diverse low-carbon economy, with local companies continuing to play a crucial role on the front lines of climate action and digital innovation,” </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/western-economic-diversification/news/2019/09/government-of-canada-invests-in-bcs-growing-digital-and-clean-technology-sectors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vancouver Economic Commission CEO Catherine Warren.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_10196" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10196" class="size-full wp-image-10196" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download.jpeg" alt="Catherine Warren, CEO, Vancouver Economic Commission" width="314" height="161" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download.jpeg 314w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download-300x154.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10196" class="wp-caption-text">Catherine Warren, CEO, Vancouver Economic Commission</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This federal funding for tech deployment unleashes the chance for startups to work with keystone institutions on urgently needed climate solutions. And funding for a regional Vancouver e-sports strategy underscores Vancouver’s bench strength in the tech, creative and entertainment industries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a March trade mission to Korea and Japan led by B.C.’s Minister of Jobs, Trade, and Technology Bruce Ralston and Minister of State for Trade George Chow sought to advance trade relationships in six key sectors, including clean energy, Cleantech, agrifoods, tourism, and information and communications technology. Japan and Korea are B.C.’s third- and fourth-largest trading partners, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Vancouver also furthered its collaborative relationship with Seattle by announcing a new cooperative </span><a href="https://www.vancouvereconomic.com/blog/media/greater-seattle-partners-joins-vancouver-economic-commission-in-cascadia-economic-development-agreement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote the economy throughout the Cascadia Innovation Corridor, running from Vancouver to Portland.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further to that point, in November Microsoft hosted the three-day Cascadia Rail Summit, gathering business leaders, government representatives, and other experts to discuss a long-in-the-works high-speed rail line that would create the potential for a one-hour trip between Vancouver and Seattle. A </span><a href="https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/LegReports/17-19/UltraHighSpeedGroundTransportation_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released in July, found that the project could attract between 1.7 million and 3 million annual trips by 2040 and generate as much as $250 million in fare revenues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to tie Vancouver and British Columbia up with its neighbors, and to link its economy with the rest of the region and the world, it’s about transportation,” SNCF America spokesperson Jerry Ray </span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6143262/vancouver-washington-oregon-high-speed-train/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it is inevitable that you’re going to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should point out that 2019 wasn’t entirely without bad news. B.C. Tech did announce in April that it would close its Cube facility in Railtown, a 6,000-square-foot community hub for AR/VR/MR established in September 2017.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tech Giants Expand Footprint</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver now has the second-lowest downtown office vacancy rate in North America, so it makes sense that smart companies spent 2019 snatching up as much of the land that’s left as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider that Amazon turned heads in 2018 when it announced a new 416,000-square-foot office in downtown Vancouver; a year later, that estimate looked downright modest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the Globe and Mail </span><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-amazon-vancouver-offices-expansion-tech-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the Seattle-based eCommerce giant will actually triple that first estimate by ultimately occupying 1.1-million square feet in downtown Vancouver. In fact, Amazon will take up an entire city block by leasing two new officer towers currently under construction that the Globe and Mail reports will be called The Post.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_10194" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10194" class="wp-image-10194 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post-1024x525.jpg" alt="Rendering of The Post" width="1024" height="525" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post-300x154.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post-768x394.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post-960x493.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Post.jpg 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10194" class="wp-caption-text">A rendering of The Post in Vancouver.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other U.S. giants are also racing to expand their footprints in B.C. In October, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were revealed for Microsoft to take over all 75,000 square feet of office space at an under-construction office building at 155 Water Street. That comes just three years after Microsoft opened its 142,000-square-foot office within the CF Pacific Centre – where nearly 1,000 people work – and the company has another office near B.C. Place Stadium. The new building – which is expected to open in 2020 – will feature a 3,800-square-foot outdoor rooftop lounge and panoramic views of the mountains and harbor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other news, Apple is </span><a href="https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/property-post/apple-plans-to-open-office-in-westbanks-glitzy-vancouver-tower"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going to establish an office in a glitzy new development at 400 West Georgia that is expected to be completed in Spring 2020, Tile – which helps users find and track their belongings – chose Vancouver as the first major office opening aside from its California headquarters, and Grammarly announced in September that it would open its fourth office around the world in Vancouver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is particularly meaningful to me, as I live in Vancouver and have had the pleasure of watching the city’s technology scene develop at an inspiring pace,” </span><a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/vancouver-office-announcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Grammarly co-founder Max Lytvyn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our new office will be based in the downtown area, and we will be expanding our team across a variety of functions and roles. The talent in Vancouver is exceptional, and I’m looking forward to the process of adding key hires to the Grammarly team from such a vibrant tech community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just major Silicon Valley companies scooping up Vancouver real estate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2018, Vancouver-based mobile game developer Kabam announced the long-term lease of 105,000 square feet across seven floors with a targeted completion date of 2021, while Slack – which was founded in Vancouver before shifting its headquarters to San Francisco – reportedly </span><a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/slack-vancouver-office-550-burrard-street"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 34,000 square feet in the Bental 5 office tower. Rumor has it that vehicle financing platform Canada Drives could take up a chunk of the new “Jenga” tower on West Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense that so many companies want to operate in Vancouver – even with all the money being thrown around locally, Vancouver still ranks as the second-cheapest city in North America for a tech company to operate, according to CBRE.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tremendous Opportunity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, Vancouver right now is a great place to be for tech workers looking for opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In CBRE’s annual Tech-30 report, Vancouver rocketed up 27 spots to take the No. 1 overall position for high-tech job growth in North America. According to the report, jobs in Vancouver’s tech scene grew at a rate of 29.5 percent over 2017 and ’18, significantly higher than runner-up San Francisco (24.7 percent), Toronto (23.9 percent), Seattle (23.7 percent) or Austin (22.5 percent).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the period from 2013 to 2018, Vancouver’s total number of tech occupations has grown by 42.6 percent to 74,700.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen the growth, but something like this (ranking) solidifies it in real terms,” </span><a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-tech-job-growth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Raghwa Gopal, President and CEO of Innovate BC. “(Vancouver) has always had a very high talent pool, and I think that’s very attractive for companies when they move here and hire people here as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another CBRE </span><a href="http://cbre.vo.llnwd.net/grgservices/secure/2019%20US%20%20Tech%20Talent.pdf?e=1575043217&amp;h=20133bbe36a787a5fc17e9728ce40b0c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offered further insight into not just the abundant opportunity in Vancouver, but also the high quality of local tech talent, which ranks near “exceptional.” They’re well-compensated, too, bringing in an average annual salary of $80,106, compared to $55,024 earned by people in the city with non-tech occupations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And talent is the most-cited driver for the companies shifting operations to the Lower Mainland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of the really salient things that stuck with us for Vancouver was that there’s a really strong market and talent quota,” </span><a href="https://www.straight.com/tech/1261681/why-so-many-silicon-valley-companies-are-moving-vancouver"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Niranjan Ravicahndran, Vancouver site lead for Asana, the work management tool company that pledged to expand from 500 employees to 700 in Vancouver by the end of 2019. “There are such a lot of startups with a strong entrepreneurial spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, people are catching on to what’s happening in B.C. – the CBRE study also found that Vancouver was Top 5 in “brain gain,” meaning out-of-towners are flocking to the city for an opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><b>VC Funding Continues to be Robust</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, B.C.’s VC funding didn’t get off to a roaring start, but business sure picked up as the year went on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $158 million over 27 deals in the first half of the year – according to the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association’s H1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Vancouver did produce some major funding rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That includes a US$71 million growth investment in PDFTron, a provider of document processing tools for software developers, and a C$75 million investment in 123Dentist from Peloton Capital Management in June. And Carbon Engineering Ltd – a Cleantech company based just north of Vancouver in Squamish – closed a C$90 million funding round in March followed by a $25 million investment from the federal government.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While those numbers were certainly encouraging, Vancouver’s VC funding skyrocketed in the third quarter, when Vancouver-based companies generated $777 million across 49 deals or 17 percent of all VC funding raised in Canada over that time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headlining deal was a massive $250 million Series D round announced by locally based legal software company Clio, one of the largest rounds in Canadian history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news kept coming. Chinhook Therapeutics announced a $65 million Series A round to discover and develop precision machines for kidney diseases, while Trulioo announced a $70 million funding round in September, and cleantech startup Terramera raised a $59.5 million Series B round in September following a $13 million round of growth capital financing in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth pointing out that Vancouver ranks in the Top 5 globally for early-stage funding per startup, according to Startup Genome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recent funding raises from companies like Clio, Trulioo and Terramera contributed to one of the most successful quarters in B.C. tech history,” Gopal </span><a href="https://betakit.com/cbre-report-sheds-new-light-on-tech-job-growth-in-vancouver/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>Local Startups Continue to Impress</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city that nurtured three of Canada’s tech unicorns – Slack, Hootsuite, and Avigilon – continues to produce thriving startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canadian Business’ Growth 500 ranking of Canada’s fastest-growing companies, Vancouver claimed three of the top 11 spots.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_6879" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6879" class="size-large wp-image-6879" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack-1024x440.png" alt="Slack Vancouver" width="1024" height="440" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack-1024x440.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack-300x129.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack-768x330.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack-960x413.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-4-slack.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6879" class="wp-caption-text">Slack Vancouver</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online furniture delivery startup Article earned the top spot again with a stunning five-year growth rate of 24,182 percent after again exceeding $100 million in gross sales. Pixieset was next at No. 8 after posting a five-year growth rate of 8,555 percent – the photography software startup was also included in Deloitte’s 2019 Fast 50 and Technology Fast 500 lists – and debt relief platform Progressa took the 11</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spot with a 6,909 percent growth rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte’s survey, meanwhile, also singled out connected mobility platform Mojio (months after the company closed a $40 million Series B round), people analytics and workforce planning startup Visier, office catering platform Foodee, and content marketing platform Pressboard, which in July announced a new software allowing brands to boost their press mentions on social media. It’s already being used by Nintendo, Intel, and Birchbox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver companies also took three of the top nine spots on Deloitte’s Enterprise Fast 15 award list, with media-tech company BroadbandTV, online gift cards solution company Buyatab Online, and Canada Drives leading the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was plenty of other good news for thriving Vancouver startups in 2019. Precision OS – a VR training platform for orthopedic surgeons that won company of the year (startup success) at the 2019 Technology Impact Awards – announced it was expanding to the U.S., while biotech startup AbCellera announced a two-year agreement with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate global health research, and fintech startup Bench Accounting managed to rebound dramatically after a first-quarter when it missed sales targets by 40 percent. By the end of the year, the company was looking to hire upward of 200 new employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Simply put, our tech companies are among the best in the world,” Gopal </span><a href="https://betakit.com/cbre-report-sheds-new-light-on-tech-job-growth-in-vancouver/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Steve and Meghan Clarke left the corporate world to launch a health food restaurant, they didn’t imagine they would soon end up on the frontlines of the digital-first restaurant revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what happened when the husband and wife team behind Tractor Everyday Healthy Foods launched a digital-first location called Tractor Digital. Opened in the summer of 2019 in Vancouver, British Columbia, the restaurant operates only through online pickup orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no servers, no cash register, and no seating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tractor Digital is part of a growing group of restaurants opting to skip table service and seating to focus on online orders through an app or website. And according to a survey of U.S. internet users and restaurant executives by retail consulting firm Boston Retail Partners (BPR), the digital-first restaurant revolution is just getting started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found that in 2017, just 6 percent of U.S. restaurant sales came through digital channels. That figure is forecast to increase to 13 percent in 2020 and to more than double to 30 percent by 2025. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the reasons why restaurants like Tractor Everday are making the transition.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Digital Channels Streamline Service </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support their transition from a traditional quick-service restaurant (Tractor operates six other locations) to a digital-only location, Tractor partnered with Apply Digital to develop an app that uses intuitive design and AI to make the checkout process seamless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know speed and convenience are very important, especially for the downtown office crowd. Even though we already had an online order app, we felt it would be valuable to offer an order ahead experience that is even more streamlined,” said Meghan Clarke, Co-Founder at Tractor Digital. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9937 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone-1024x530.jpg" alt="Digital Tractor Phone Order" width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone-300x155.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone-768x397.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone-960x497.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/phone.jpg 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tractor Digital app offers promos and incentives during the checkout process, optimizes menu options, and can track customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was indeed challenging to find and set up the technology. We’ve learned a lot and expect to keep working hard to refine the technology setup,” says Clarke. </span></p>
<h2><b>Investing in Digital Solutions Helps the Bottom Line</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding a new idea or business model doesn’t come without risk, especially in the foodservice industry where many businesses don’t last. But there is strong evidence that investing in digital dining tech can pay off. Digital dining options can translate into as much as a 20 percent increase in average guest spend, with even bigger gains coming from Millenials (26 percent) and Gen Z (22 percent), according to the BPR survey.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9936 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor-1024x530.jpg" alt="Tractor Digital Busy" width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor-300x155.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor-768x397.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor-960x497.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/grouptractor.jpg 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tractor Digital, the payoff is twofold. Customers save time by pre-ordering online or through the app, and restaurant staff can focus on making quality food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our staff are chefs first and foremost. At Tractor Digital, the emphasis is less on customer service and more on kitchen skills, which fits with Tractor’s commitment to creating clean, fresh foods,” says Clarke.</span></p>
<h2><b>Digital Initiatives Provide Operational Flexibility </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to digital transformation in the restaurant industry, online ordering is just the tip of the iceberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital ordering makes it easier to keep track of who your customers are, how often they order and what they’re ordering. Digital menus allow restaurants to constantly tweak their offerings based on what is selling weekly, daily, or even hourly. Transitioning to digital also allows restaurants to adjust pricing and offer promos to sell off overstock of a certain menu item, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seems to be a lot of different concepts and ideas being tried out, as it isn’t entirely clear what works and what doesn’t yet in this rapidly changing industry of quick-serve,” says Clarke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that’s true, by simply giving restaurants more options, digital dining technology is allowing them to be more nimble, <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowtDigitalFirstEat">data-focused</a>, and adaptable to customer needs, all of which bodes well for restauranteurs and the industry as a whole. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Design &amp; Content conference is kicking off in Vancouver on July 17th, and the three-day conference offers a wide range of workshops and talks from industry leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We picked out five talks you won’t want to miss. </span></p>
<p><b>You Are Not the Target &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday, July 18 at 11:15 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this talk, Jon Crowley, the Strategy Director at SID LEE, explores the ways a target audience should impact and inform the way marketers and designers work and, more importantly, what they create. </span></p>
<p><b>Content Strategy as a Methodology &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday, July 19 at 9:10 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Loving, the Content Design Director at Publicis Sapient, looks at the expanding scope of responsibilities for Content Strategists (seen in the rise of jobs like Content Designer, UX Writer, and more), and asks if approaching content strategy as a methodology could unify this mix of content-related practices. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Content for Humanitarian Immigration Services &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, July 19 at 9:55 a.m</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this talk, Crystal Yan, the Content and Service Designer at the US Digital Service, will provide real-world examples of the impact human-centered design has had on asylum seekers, and offers key insights into how marketers can improve their content and service designs.</span></p>
<p><b>Strategic Writing for UX &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, July 19 at 10:55 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Torrey Podmajersky, a UX Writer at Google, explores how UX writing is different from other forms of content, where it fits in, how to measure its impact, and where UX writers fit in the design and development process. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Safe Platforms for Marginalized Users &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday, July 19 at 2:15 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Bromell, the founder of Thurst (a dating app for the LGBTQIA+ community), explores </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the process of determining what is “safe” and what security means as you develop the structure of a platform, app, product, or service that has marginalized users.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">See BrainStation at </span></i><a href="https://content.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design &amp; Content</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, July 17-19, in Vancouver. </span></i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Vancouver, a few big names often draw the most attention: Hootsuite, Bench, Article, Unbounce, and Clio, to name a few. Rightfully so, as each startup has demonstrated rapid year-over-year growth and funding from a myriad of reputable VCs. Vancouver, however, is a burgeoning hub of talent and tech startups. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you might have heard of some (if not all) the names listed above, there are plenty of promising up-and-coming startups in the city you should get to know. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six Vancouver startups that should be on your radar, as they’re on the cusp of rapid growth. </span></p>



<h2><b><a href="http://meetblume.com">Blume</a></b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blume is the evolution of Ellebox, a subscription service that helps women deal with period pain. Launched in 2016 by sisters Bunny and Taran Ghatrora, the brand has now rebranded itself as Blume, a puberty-centric line of all natural self-care products intended for girls. Blume products range from tampons and pads to essential oils are all 100% chemical free, 100 percent premium organic cotton, biodegradable, hypoallergenic, BPA free, and FDA approved. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in April, Blume secured $3.3 million in seed funding, led by Grace Chou and Victoria Treyger, partners at Felicis Ventures, with participation from Victress Capital. Funds will be used to grow their current four-person team, and for more content to further establish the brand’s vision of a safe space for girls to talk about their periods.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from IBM determined that annual demand for Data Scientists, Data Developers, and Data Engineers would reach nearly 700,000 openings by 2020, with the number of total jobs rising 39 percent to 2.72 million total positions. Those numbers are backed up by an Indeed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing that data science postings have rocketed 256 percent since December 2013, and they increased a full 31 percent year-over-year in December 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, the ICTC report forecast that the big data market would exceed 43,000 jobs by 2020, an increase of 33 percent. What’s more, the Information and Communications Technology Council </span><a href="https://www.ictc-ctic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ICTC_DigitalTalent2020_ENGLISH_FINAL_March2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Canada’s data analytics market to generate roughly $1.8 billion in annual revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are reasons to believe that this will be lead by B.C – and more specifically its largest city. Here are some reasons why Vancouver might be the place to be for data professionals in Canada.</span></p>

<h3><b>Salaries for Data Professionals in Canada are Highest in Vancouver</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of big data has increased demand for these skills across Canada, and salaries have kept pace with the demand. In fact, Indeed cites the average salary for Data Scientists around $104,000 in Canada as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, salaries for data-related roles are highest in Vancouver. Data Analysts in Vancouver </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/salaries/Data-Analyst-Salaries,-Vancouver-BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make 29 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> above the national average, while Senior Data Scientists are found to average </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/salaries/Senior-Data-Scientist-Salaries,-Vancouver-BC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$143,437 per year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 23 percent above the Canadian average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The higher cost of housing in Vancouver may play a role in these figures, but there are two other factors that are likely also influencing average salaries: </span></p>
<p><b>Vancouver’s Tech Industry Keeps Growing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, B.C.’s biggest city has emerged as one of the world’s top expansion destinations for tech industry giants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon recently announced it was looking to bring 3,000 jobs to Vancouver by 2022; Facebook is preparing to open a downtown office on Burrard Street; and Samsung is planning a 20,000-square-foot office in the False Creek Flats (in the same sprawling building that will house gaming studio </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlackBird Interactive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Meanwhile, the recently announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Technology Supercluster</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with more than 350 member organizations, is expected to create 50,000 new jobs and pump $15 billion in GDP into B.C.’s economy over the next decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data side of the tech industry is not being overlooked in this exciting growth phase for the province and city. Already, 19 percent of Canadian big data jobs are in B.C. (according to another</span><a href="https://www.ictc-ctic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BIG-DATA-2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ICTC study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), despite the province claiming just 13 percent of the Canadian population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not going unnoticed, and some large companies have started to look at Vancouver as a potential hub for data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boeing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, opened its Boeing Vancouver Labs in September 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pledging</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer 200 new “high-income” jobs in data to help the company apply “data analytics, rapid product development, and agile software approaches to a variety” of tough problems faced by the aviation industry. </span></p>
<p><b>The City is Facing a Digital (and Data) Skills Shortage </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.workbc.ca/getmedia/8d38ac6f-82d4-4db1-b0bf-ac0f77d78af5/2016_TechTalentBC_Report.pdf.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 TechTalentBC Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forecasted demand for 47,000 tech workers by 2021 while predicting that the available supply would total only 16,500. That’s a gap of more than 30,000 positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, B.C.-based companies are facing a challenge finding qualified candidates in tech. According to a March 2018 report from Indeed.com, 33 percent of tech jobs in Vancouver are “hard to fill,” meaning they stay open for longer than 60 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting the expected need for data professionals in Vancouver will likely require upskilling the local workforce, especially as data science roles are generally “hard to fill,” given that the skillset is still relatively rare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps that’s why BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that continuing education was an integral part of most data professionals’ lives. The survey found that 72 percent of data professionals had participated in online courses, 68 percent in workshops, seminars or conferences, and 63 percent in in-person courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That statistic correlates to the large and growing number of people looking to build a career in data from the ground up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed crunched the numbers and recently found that among Vancouver users, three of the top six </span><a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/highest-paying-most-searched-for-jobs-vancouver-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most-searched-for jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> centered on data, including Data Warehouse Engineer and Data Scientist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was reinforced by BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey, which found that many data professionals, in Vancouver and beyond, have switched careers to take advantage of the demand for data skills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, 79 percent of respondents did not begin their career in data, and 65 percent have been working for five years or less.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/4-years-in-vancouver-the-rise-of-a-tech-giant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver’s continued rise as a tech giant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be reckoned with, and 2018 proved to be a big year for the city’s digital sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we start to wind down for the holidays, we decided to take a look back at the year that was. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most important Vancouver tech industry stories from 2018.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments Continue to Support Growth</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the Canadian government announced that the British Columbia-led </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Technology Supercluster</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was one of the funding recipients for its Innovation Supercluster Initiative. The Supercluster is expected to create 50,000 new jobs and pump $15 billion in GDP into B.C.’s economy over the next decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was also a cash influx from the province, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced more than $100 million in funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 75 research projects. It’s one of the reasons more than 80,000 tech-related job openings are expected in the region by 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And despite a less than friendly relationship between Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump, 2018 also signaled stronger ties between the Vancouver region and its neighboring US states. In October, B.C. premier John Horgan and Washington governor Jay Inslee </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">met as part of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cascadia Innova</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tion Corridor Conference</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an annual event that brings government and business leaders together from both countries.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_7866" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7866" class="size-medium wp-image-7866" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/horgan-inslee-300x200.jpg" alt="B.C. Premier John Horgan and Washington State Governor Jay Inslee " width="300" height="200" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/horgan-inslee-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/horgan-inslee-768x513.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/horgan-inslee.jpg 804w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7866" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit: Alaska Highway News</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Inslee and I are working together to make life better for people across the region, and the Cascadia Innovation Corridor is critically important to that work,” Horgan said in a press statement. “This forward-thinking initiative brings together governments with the tech sector to grow the innovation economy. Our government will continue to work collaboratively to advance these shared goals and create good jobs for people on both sides of the border.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />This is not just lip service. Over the past two years, a s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eaplane service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been established between Seattle and Vancouver, and a feasibility study (backed by Microsoft) on an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultra-high-speed rail line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Oregon and B.C. is expected to conclude in 2019.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tourism Vancouver announced a partnership with Tencen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t, an investment holding conglomerate (and one of the largest companies in the world), that will promote Vancouver as a tourist destination to Chinese travelers. Tencent owns WeChat, a communication app for Chinese citizens with over one billion active users. The partnership will create Canada’s first-ever WeChat city app, which will act as a mobile guide for tourists, with information on hotels, restaurants, shops, attractions, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B.C. government, however, was also thinking locally, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing $100,000 to support Futurpreneur Canada’s Rock My Business Plan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative. Futurpreneur Canada is a national non-profit organization that offers financing and mentorship to aspiring business owners aged 18 to 39. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money will go toward workshops in six communities across the province, covering how to manage cash flow, financing, market research, and operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realize that it can be difficult for young people to gain the skills, knowledge, and financing needed to start a successful business,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Jobs, Trade, and Technology. “The free Rock My Business Plan workshops provide mentoring and tools that can help young entrepreneurs overcome business challenges and start the journey of launching a successful business.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Giants Play a Role</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major players also made their mark in Vancouver in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started with PCI Developments and Low Tide Properties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing a new, seven-story office development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will be designed for “the emerging digital media and creative sectors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development will offer 160,000 square feet of office space, which is the equivalent of adding a tenth of Vancouver’s current office space to the False Creek area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This adds significant supply to an emerging neighborhood that has been endorsed by the global and local creative and tech companies, including the first tenants into this new building,” said </span><a href="http://www.cbre.ca/EN/o/vancouver/people/blair-quinn/Pages/overview.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair Quinn, Executive Vice President at CBRE Canada</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon announced plans to expand its Vancouver Tech Hub</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating 3,000 jobs over the next few years in e-commerce, cloud computing, and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Facebook will be opening a new office in the city, taking over two floors (and approximately 36,000 square feet) in Cadillac Fairview’s Waterfront Centre.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_7871" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7871" class="wp-image-7871 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Kirsten-Sutton-300x161.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="161" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Kirsten-Sutton-300x161.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Kirsten-Sutton-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7871" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Kirsten Sutton, SAP | Credit: Science World </em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year also marked the public unveiling of SAP’s expanded office. A global market leader in enterprise application software, the company’s Vancouver labs have added more than 300 jobs since 2016, and this expansion completed the second phase of a $22-million investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proudly the largest software employer in British Columbia, committed to this province and to developing local talent,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.bctechnology.com/news/2018/10/15/SAP-Canada-Unveils-Expanded-Vancouver-Facility-(Addition-of-300-New-Desks-and-70000-Square-Feet-of-Space).cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Kirsten Sutton, Managing Director at SAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We stand side by side with Premier Horgan and his government with common goals to solidify B.C. as a high-tech powerhouse.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding is on the Rise </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">banner year on the funding side as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with companies in Vancouver accounting for $264M in funding in the first half of 2018 alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the lower end of the spectrum, Alavida Health, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a science-based remote treatment program for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) announced it had raised $2 million, with Nimbus Synergies Inc. leading the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Dooly.ai, which helps simplify administrative tasks for sales professionals, also raised $2 million, in a round led by ScaleUP Ventures, with participation from Panache Ventures, Pallasite Ventures, and New Avenue Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere, Cozystay Holdings Inc., a vacation rental platform targeting Chinese vacationers, completed $4M in seed funding in 2018. While Eventbase Technology, a leading mobile event technology platform for global brands, raised $6.5 million. Madrona Venture Group participated in this financing along with BC Tech Fund (managed by Kensington Capital). Eventbase also recently received additional financing from Silicon Valley Bank and Espresso Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the largest funding rounds was generated by startup LoginRaduius, which helps companies centralize customer data and then build an integrated consumer experience. LoginRaduius raised $17 million in Series A Funding, led by ForgePoint Capital and Microsoft’s venture fund, M12. The company intends to use the funding to accelerate product innovation, customer acquisition, and global expansion.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_7874" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7874" class="size-medium wp-image-7874" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/elastic-path-welcome-sign-300x126.jpg" alt="Elastic Path, Vancouver" width="300" height="126" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/elastic-path-welcome-sign-300x126.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/elastic-path-welcome-sign-768x322.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-7874" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Credit: Elastic Path</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the top end of the funding spectrum, though, is leader Elastic Path, a provider of enterprise headless commerce solutions, which announced $43 million in Series B growth investment. Funding for this round was led by Sageview Capital, with participation from current investors, Yaletown Partners, and BDC Venture Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, though, Vancouver-based biopharmaceutical company Zymeworks signed a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">licensing and collaboration deal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with BeiGene, worth a potential $1 billion. The two companies will now collaborate on the development and commercialization of molecularly-targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorola, meanwhile, agreed to buy Vancouver-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avigilon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for approximately $1 billion in cold, hard cash. Avigilon products include surveillance cameras and video analytics software, which are used in airports, government facilities, retail, and more. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local Heavyweights Make Their Presence Felt </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the city’s HIVE Blockchain Technologies, one of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency mining companies, acquired Kolos Norway AS, a Norway-based data center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons for the acquisition was the center’s potential to provide more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable, hydroelectricity energy. HIVE’s current operations consume only 44.2 megawatts of energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is another major milestone in our continuing global expansion as a leading blockchain and cryptocurrency infrastructure company,” Harry Pokrandt, CEO and director of HIVE, </span><a href="https://techvibes.com/2018/03/28/vancouvers-hive-blockchain-acquires-norwegian-data-centre-for-10-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Techvibes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same month, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Dota 2 Championships, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he biggest esports tournament in the world, announced that it was coming to Vancouver – the first time it would be held in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t the only thing shining a spotlight on Vancouver, though. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 companies from the area made it onto Deloitte’s 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology Fast 500 list</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which recognizes the fastest growing technology, media, telecoms, life science, and energy tech companies in North America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bench Accounting, an accounting service for small businesses, came in at the top of local companies, at number 28. The company has increased revenue by 4,373 percent over the past four years and announced plans this year to hire 100 more people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next local company to make the list was Left, a multinational media and technology company focusing on using personal devices to amplify wifi signals. Left came in at number 101. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the full list of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recognized by Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 list:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bench Accounting, ranked 28</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left, ranked 101</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foodee, ranked 108</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier, ranked 154</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eastside Games Inc., ranked 157</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Drives, ranked 193</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BuyATab Online Inc., ranked 222</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbounce, ranked 222</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copperleaf, ranked 321</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clio, ranked 377</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appnovation, ranked 420</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreement Express, ranked 468</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elsewhere on the growth front, visual effects studio </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Engine announced in October </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that they planned on adding 150 more employees over the next two years. To accommodate this expansion, the company will be moving into a new, bigger space in Mount Pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, when it comes to growth, one only has to look at Hootsuite for an example of a company that made it big. Hootsuite celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2018, and they have a lot to be proud of. The social media management platform now employs more than 1,000 people across 14 international offices. It also has over 17 million users, including clients like HBO, and the White House (although it’s doubtful a certain commander-in-chief is managing his Twitter feed through Hootsuite).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The past decade has been an exceptional ride,” said Ryan Holmes, Hootsuite’s Founder and CEO. “We’ve been fueled by our customers and their success, and we can’t wait to invent the future of social with our customers over the next decade.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tech Ecosystem Continues to Grow</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver is now the 15th largest startup ecosystem in the world, with the province as a whole getting its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">first “A” grade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in KPMG&#8217;s 2018 British Columbia Technology Report Card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The story of British Columbia’s tech industry continues to be a story of success and sky-high opportunity,” </span><a href="https://wearebctech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-BC-technology-report-card_FY18_FINAL_14-Nov.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jill Tipping, BC Tech Association president and CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the B.C. tech industry is the province’s fastest-growing sector, generating more than $29 billion in revenue, which is a greater share of the region’s GDP than the forestry industry. The amazing thing is that there is still lots of room for Vancouver to grow. In the 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tech-talent scorecard from CBRE group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Vancouver came 25th for job growth — well below Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto among Canadian cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, with a thriving startup ecosystem, there’s incredible potential for the city to continue its upward trends in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s growing recognition of the strength of the ecosystem, and an increased awareness of the strong companies that are coming out of Vancouver,” Cameron Burke, a Vancouver-based managing director within the technology industry at PwC Canada, </span><a href="https://betakit.com/vancouvers-diverse-tech-portfolio-fuelling-ecosystems-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told BetaKit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was also a big year for BrainStation Vancouver, with the launch of the city’s first full-time <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data science diploma program</a>, a range of new <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certificate courses</a>, and <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keynotes and panel discussions</a> with some of the region’s most inspiring industry leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last year, our campus has turned into a unique, dynamic community hub, and like our city (and its tech sector), we’re only getting better with time.</span></p>
