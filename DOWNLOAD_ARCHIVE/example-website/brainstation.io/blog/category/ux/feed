<p><strong>Designing Inclusive Digital Experiences</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 11, and featured four inclusive design and user experience experts from Headspace, Capital One, and Google.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/522939888" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Inclusivity is fundamental to making digital experiences and products accessible to the largest possible group of users. It plays out in all the ways users interact with digital products – which means technology is a key factor in making a user journey successful.</p>



<p>Today, as technology improves and the interface between user and product becomes ever more seamless, the definition of inclusivity is growing to encompass not just a product’s functionality for all users, but also its ability to satisfy all users at an emotional level – an ambition that comprises an even wider range of considerations.</p>



<p>Our panel lineup included four people working at the forefront of designing inclusive digital experiences – from Google and Google Assistant, meditation app Headspace, and banking company Capital One. Together, they shared their insights on how the umbrella of inclusivity is expanding, the centrality of the user and their journey to the design process, and how to successfully build more inclusivity into digital experiences. <br></p>



<h2><strong>Inclusivity Is More Than Accessibility</strong></h2>



<p>Ensuring that digital products are physically accessible to nearly all users is increasingly seen as the bare minimum. Features like closed captioning for the hearing impaired, descriptive text for the visually impaired, and multiple ways of navigating for people with impaired motor skills not only mean that more users can access the product – they also send a powerful message about the importance of inclusivity to all users. While not feasible in every circumstance, universal accessibility can now be considered a baseline, at least in terms of ambition.</p>



<p>As <strong>Eunjoo Kim</strong>, UX Design Lead at Google Assistant, explains, “If you don’t apply inclusive design in your products, or in emerging technologies which have physical interactions, your design is not just bad, but is unusable.” </p>



<p>Inclusivity, in other words, is not an add-on; it’s a core design principle.</p>



<p>But inclusivity doesn’t end with a user’s ability to physically use the technology; it also speaks to multiple social dimensions, including language and nationality, race and ethnicity, sexuality, age, and socioeconomic status, as well as more fine-grained distinctions like one’s level of educational, financial situation or geographical location – even the way ideas like “family” means different things to different people.</p>



<p>As <strong>J.R. Miller</strong>, UX Writer and Product Designer at Google, says, “They need not all be lumped together like that. And indeed, it’s impossible to lump them all together.” There’s no one-size-fits-all template for making a product inclusive to everyone; each of these considerations must be weighed individually.</p>



<p>For <strong>Klaus Heesch</strong>, Director of Experience Design at banking group Capital One, inclusivity takes on a financial dimension, and includes topics like “the democratization of trading, for example, and access to the trading markets, which used to be just for wealthy white Wall Streeters,” he notes.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Input Determines Output</strong></h2>



<p>Heesch, summarizing a lesson from Antionette Carroll of Creative Reaction Lab, advises “Design <em>with</em> your customers, not <em>for</em> your customers.” But while letting your users shape your inclusivity design process can yield crucial insights, this advice comes with a caveat. To combat bias, input must be as inclusive as possible at every stage, from hiring to research and user testing to, finally, the data generated by end users.</p>



<p>When it comes to hiring, explains <strong>Frank Bach</strong>, Lead Product Designer at Headspace, inclusivity leads to better products. “If you can make [your design teams] as inclusive as possible – hearing from as many different people as you can, from different backgrounds, different life journeys, different languages, making sure that there’s not a lot of sameness in the types of people that you’re inviting to these groups – then you should have better outcomes. Not just business outcomes, but [also along] the more human metrics of, are people enjoying this product? Do they feel like it understands them? Do they feel some type of connection and community to the service or product that you’re building?” Today’s work-from-home climate has made achieving diversity in hiring much easier, Bach says, especially when it comes to hiring people whose experience includes a different set of circumstances than are found in Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Diversity is just as crucial to inclusivity at the research and testing stage, Kim says. “When we say ‘machine learning,’ sometimes you’d think it’s a magic box – it will magically happen. Well, it’s not true. The machine starts based on data that’s input from humans. Then the machine builds a solution – an output which inherits human bias….If you don’t have inclusive input, you won’t have inclusive output.” </p>



<p>“For user research and testing,” Kim says, “recruiting a diverse set of participants is important. We try to include people with different accents and different family types.</p>



<p>Miller agrees. “The most important tool we’ve been using, especially on my team, is listening: listening to users, listening to each other, and listening deeply before we even make a design decision that will impact inclusivity.”</p>



<p>“Users are the designers,” Kim explains. “They are content creators, they are content reviewers, and they are product sellers,” she says. “So users are a part of this ecosystem.”<br></p>



<h2><strong>Fight For The User</strong></h2>



<p>This emphasis on being responsive to all users is at the heart of designing inclusivity; the UX Designer’s mandate is, in a sense, to fight for the user. In any product design, there are always competing interests, but as Bach explains, championing the user is a priority from both a user case and a business case.</p>



<p>“We’re not singling out that this is a product experience for this type of person or that type of person,” Bach says. “And on the product side or the user experience side, we’re making sure that when we’re setting things up – for example, our design system components – we’re working on buttons, states, or typography to make sure that we’re covering our bases for things like proper color contrasts, or using haptic feedback in a way that is meaningful for people….And as a designer, I think I’m getting smarter at building the business case for getting these things done. You know what is the right thing to do, but in a company of a few hundred people, it can sometimes be a challenge to fight for the user and only the user.”</p>



<p>Miller agrees, emphasizing that keeping the user foremost in mind isn’t just about design – it’s also about content. “You have to think about the user, and speak like the user, and write in ways so that as many users as possible will understand you, as well as your product.” In fact, Miller emphasizes, voice is one of the most meaningful ways to build inclusivity; the wrong language can leave people feeling excluded.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Inclusivity Is About a Sense of Belonging</strong></h2>



<p>In fact, building that sense of belonging is the overarching goal of inclusivity measures. Usability and accessibility both signal to a user that a product was made for them, but inclusivity goes beyond user interface; language and content are also important. “When a user feels ‘It’s made for me, made for my family, made for my gender, made for my country,’ it just creates emotional satisfaction,” Kim says. “To me, design is not just a matter of usability or utility, but of feeling and happiness.”</p>



<p>For Miller, this begins with the word. “[It’s] important to think about language and voice and tone as a part of the design system of the product.” Miller warns against the use of idioms, which not only don’t translate well, but are also interpreted differently even between cultures that speak the same language: “Especially when you’re building a global product, you need to make sure that you’re writing language that can be understood by a global audience….And you want to make sure you’re writing at no more than an eighth grade reading level. I know it’s a hard thing to measure, but there are tools online that can help you figure that out….You don’t get any brownie points for sounding smart.”</p>



<p>Like all UX design, inclusive design ultimately comes down to empathy – taking care to speak like the user. </p>



<p>While personas have long been used to develop empathy, Heesch sees the way they define and limit understanding of the user as detrimental to building belonging, and predicts personas are on their way out. “[Our understanding of audience is] moving away from simplistic or generic personas,” Heesch says. “That idea that everyone’s going to fit into some sort of average is not appropriate, and it’s not inclusive, and it leaves a lot of people, in fact, excluded. Historically, a lot of designers have worked around the idea of a persona….The problem with that is, every individual isn’t locked into one mode, and doesn’t fit into one standard.”</p>



<p>In place of personas, Heesch looks to archetypes, which emphasize not the supposedly universal characteristics of a certain type of person, but rather where a given person is on their own personal path. “We have to understand that anyone, in any group, travels through their own journey, and our hurdles and the challenges that we face are many and different. Our experiences, socio-economic backgrounds, education, and many more factors shape our attitudes and our views,” he says. “We as designers have to take that into consideration….Our obligation as designers is to realize that we’re designing for the long haul, and these experiences that we’re making should evolve and adapt to our users’ place in life, meeting them where they are.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ec-NPNPh0lQFO4-DL5jprzjZtRB0syEeOUkRb5DP8rZhz1OiiQY656Oa_goeu4AZvxL-ZXd9zm3rVRFXzvTPGh0imAnMmuOaFGznUqBpqivWKFrOSz6FTMAzXSLzEk4UQevlfnOy" alt="" width="240" height="360"/></figure></div>



<p>In 2016, Mathieu Bellemare had an idea for an app; he just didn’t know how to design it. That initial desire to bring his ideas to life led him to BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">UX Design bootcamp</a>, and ultimately towards a career in Product Design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Design, however, isn’t all that Bellemare does; he’s also the Co-Founder of Yohomo, Toronto’s leading site for the artistic Queer community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://yohomo.ca/">Yohomo</a> works to bring Toronto’s LGBTQ2+ communities together by highlighting parties, events, plays, screenings, marches, and exclusive Spotify playlists. They also host a seasonal gay bash for everyone to come together and celebrate.</p>



<p>We spoke with Bellemare about Yohomo and how his success in UX and Product design helped him build a career and passion project.</p>



<h2>Creating a Community Around Music and Dance</h2>



<p>Bellemare&#8217;s Co-Founders Armand Digdoyo and Phil Villeneuve once worked as&nbsp;DJs, and they were often asked about other events to attend in the nightlife scene.</p>



<p>“People have been isolated by social media bubbles and it’s hard to discover certain events if you don’t already have an &#8216;in&#8217;. So, we decided to create a website that would make it possible for anyone to find events in Toronto through a simple Google search,” Bellemare said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more events they shared, the wider their audience grew, and with Toronto queer magazines in short supply since the shuttering of publications like FAB or the end of the print edition of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/xtra-gay-newspaper-in-toronto-ottawa-and-vancouver-announces-end-of-print-1.2900981"><em>Xtra</em></a><em>,</em> Yohomo quickly filled a void.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dmcNBOjTRqt3JISRFMh6TS7JAsiUyPTjqEeEEsc0t2fZgTlejM9SXARf_q1n1iW3hKBtR8cYLWGMMFF86VgdK0_U3Tms8SvVfAPb8NTZdVn2Qdx31rJx9Yd0s66HbBlp0BoKxHaC" alt="Group of six people posing for a picture at a queer event showing off their Drag, wigs, and pink leopard print and more. "/></figure>



<p>“What started with just a couple of friends browsing for events, grew into a full blog, collaborations with visual artists for merch, fundraisers, in-person events, etc.” The trio now work with a team of collaborators, including Writers, DJs, Graphic Artists, Performers, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A unique component to the Yohomo community is their exclusive music playlists and partnership with Spotify. “We had an opportunity to partner up with Spotify in our second year and that started a full <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6TGtQBvSPVtbyvdpTbtmW1?si=Q6EHbEUDTZGwhnVjVew_CA">Spotify channel</a> in which we highlight queer talent and the songs we love,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My job is mostly to manage the musical voice of our playlists as well as communicating with new artists [&#8230;] and finding a way to showcase their talent!”</p>



<h2>Building Design Systems</h2>



<p>When Bellemare isn’t working on finding the next best musical talent, his day is filled with conversations about systematic design as a Product Designer at Apply Digital.</p>



<p>“I would say most of my work is around creating solid design systems with a focus on inclusion and accessibility. I consult and help on a lot of projects in regards to digital accessibility, which tends to be overlooked in the industry,” Bellmare shared.</p>



<p>“The truth is, people need a lot of convincing in order to realize the importance of accessibility, and it just so happens that I love to convince people!”</p>



<h2>Creating an Inclusive Tech Space&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We asked Bellemare what the tech community should do to be more inclusive of the Queer community, but understandably, he remarks that it’s a loaded question and a lot of action is required.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aaf_Yo1UtYd8VZpp9C1KTsVe_YMW5DQ096qgy5RMYcMPKKk2hTV__PI4Y_IZCDjPzdnVgwMyT3pqr8DYChisqp7dRedaWIHn4C4PacQtmnskWAQjGviACOPuSy0pcaKy4EkyH3R_" alt="The Yohomo Team: Armand Digdoyo, Phil Villeneuve, and Mathieu Bellemare" width="481" height="445"/></figure></div>



<p>“I think more than ever the effort needs to be on the intersectionality of the Queer community. It&#8217;s important we work on removing the classist barrier that exists currently in technology at all levels, but mostly at the founder and C-suite level,” he shares.</p>



<p>“Diverse leaders get you diverse teams, diverse ideas and companies only profit from including inclusive practices that are simply more representative of the audience.”</p>



<h2>Building a Design Skill Set&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Bellemare was a singer before joining the tech scene, so when it came to design, he had to start from the basics. He shares the high-intensity environment at BrainStation was exactly what he needed to learn quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than anything he says, BrainStation helped him understand how to learn and learn enough to eventually launch his own journey into design. He notes that BrainStation’s project-based learning encourages students to be “a bit crazier, louder, and riskier about [their] ideas, since there was no fear of expectations. This attitude still carries me to this day to take risks in everything I do and push the envelope.”</p>



<p>After his experience, Bellemare has fond memories of his time at BrainStation. “I still have a couple of good friends from that experience, both students and teachers, and they are always there to back me up or give me the tips on what is happening in the industry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked what Bellemare was most proud of at Yohomo, he just laughed.</p>



<p>“Of course this is too hard to respond to!” He said. “The latest thing we do is always our proudest. We are four years old, so still have a lot of objectives to fill and we do that by doing a little something new every month!”</p>



<p>So, then what’s next?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t reveal too much yet! But, lots of new content, videos, a possible expansion across Canada and hopefully a return of our quarterly parties when possible. We love to get together with our crowd, especially when it involves outdoors, blazing sun, and stupid bubbly fruity drinks!”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This last month, graduates had the opportunity to participate in our first stay-at-home hackathon (in partnership with Microsoft).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each team had three days to design a solution for a better work-from-home experience that could integrate with the Microsoft Teams video chat software. After a few intense days of work and collaboration, the judges were seriously impressed with the results.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-1024x536.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11935" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-768x402.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-1536x804.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-2048x1072.jpg 2048w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1-960x502.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15120306/Frame-6-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We spoke with the winning team: Pablo Lopez Castillo (UX Design), Jung Oh (UX Design), Ali Eddeb (Data Science), and Nick Mahon (Data Science). Together, the alumni designed FocusBuddy, a productivity app to help you stay focused on your tasks.</p>



<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>Having recently completed their full-time diploma programs at BrainStation, the graduates were eager to test their new skills with a challenge from a tech giant like Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By participating in this hackathon, my hope was that I would be exposed to the types of challenges or projects Microsoft employees get to tackle, as well as how they solve them,” Oh said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For their project, the winning team wanted to reflect the current conditions professionals face when working from home. “We found that productivity was a primary issue remote workers face due to a variety of reasons. One of the most prominent pain points users had with productivity was that they had trouble maintaining self-discipline when attempting to thwart distractions (such as a cell phone),” the team explained.</p>



<p>The team decided to focus on developing a Microsoft Teams add-on called FocusBuddy, which helps boost remote productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FocusBuddy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Identifies user work habits and suggests on how to improve them with computer vision</li><li>Sends reminders and recommendations throughout a session to increase productivity and wellness&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Awards points for uninterrupted work and healthy habits</li><li>&nbsp;Allows daily team goal-setting with leader boards and results&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>Working Together</h2>



<p>Working remotely, the team used a plethora of tools to iterate, create, collaborate, and test. The Designers relied on Sketch, Figma, and Invision, while the Data Scientists used Sublime Text 3, Anaconda Prompt, and Jupyter Notebooks. Of course, Microsoft Teams also supported communication and collaboration to keep them working together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Seeing our concept come to life within the time constraints was satisfying as we all had pivotal roles,” Castillo said, explaining that there were many proud moments amongst the team.&nbsp;As a bonus, the team created a product <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFr-fAFbb8u6iAJivQWQgxv3bm4342Wk/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">commercial</a> which really tied the whole presentation together. </p>



<p>Eddeb for one was impressed by the team dynamics. “We were able to criticize our ideas well and did not fall into groupthink. We were able to delegate tasks effectively and we overall had a good time working together.”</p>



<p>Similarly, Oh enjoyed working with Data Scientists to leverage unique solutions. “We were able to ask our Data Scientists to provide thought-provoking perspectives, educate ourselves regarding the possibilities of data, and implement innovative solutions as a result.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mahon, meanwhile, was pleased with the way the UX team brought their ideas into reality. “Bringing such a polished look to an otherwise rough idea was incredible.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-1024x536.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11938" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-1024x536.jpeg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-300x157.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-768x402.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-960x502.jpeg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But it wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting the project, in particular, posed a challenge. “There were just so many ways to approach the improvement of the work-from-home experience,” the team said. “We spent a significant amount of time redefining our problem space to achieve what we felt to be the best solution.”</p>



<p>As they moved forward, the team relied on what they learned at BrainStation to find success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From the plethora of knowledge gained in completing the Data Science program at BrainStation, the most relevant of it was learned during 3D day,” Mahon said. BrainStation 3D is a day in which students from the UX, Data, and Web Dev platforms come together for a day-long collaborative competition to practice working cross-functionally. “Working with UX Designers beforehand and having an idea of how our work complements one another went a long way in arriving at our final product,” said Mahon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The others agreed that BrainStation gave them the tools to work well as a multidisciplinary group. Plablo shared that the program taught him skills that helped him with “navigating the problem space and understanding how to extract insights and translating research to identify user needs is a skill I am always working to improve on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh agreed that the diploma program taught them how to approach problems in a team setting. “This skill was useful in the hackathon because it enabled our team to get all of our ideas on the table, use our individual strengths and knowledge to analyze and select an idea to move work with, and apply the technical skills we have been trained in.”</p>



<h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>



<p>The team encourages other recent graduates and others seeking a role in UX or Data to practice, practice, practice. Edebb says the best advice he’s received is to continue working on projects. “Once you have foundational knowledge, try to implement what you have learned by working on projects.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, Mahon reminds us:<em> </em>“The slogan that is heard throughout our time at BrainStation is based on being ‘a lifetime learner.’ My advice is to do exactly that; there is never nothing new to learn and the more you know, the more directions you will be able to take your career.”<br></p>

<p>We spoke with Kwan to find out more about her learning experience and her capstone project: Lemon House.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Making the Change&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Kwan was educated in the sciences, but when it came time to enter the workforce, she decided to switch focus and pursue a career she’d love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I went to university for a science degree, but knew that wasn’t where my passion lied, and I really wanted to be in a field that challenged me creatively.” She learned about UX design from some friends and was intrigued by the mix of research and design.</p>



<p>“I wanted to take the chance at pursuing my passions and taking a leap of faith in trying to change careers,” she said, explaining her decision to join BrainStation’s UX Design Diploma program.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sWrp4pN02ra8QDYMUDN7D6_57uVTvxMJnAKp9Q8RT1ouPm0M0M1m7lE7aD5Vl5HxV9KsyXvtakZExYvHJst6yoaqZ08U8GjOCRoLYcDK4cuGpcpJV_BxW6LH3glUmh6PNb9l6bKb" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>The Student Housing Problem</h2>



<p>For her capstone project, Kwan decided to create <a href="https://www.byvanessakwan.com/lemon-house">Lemon House</a>, a mobile app focused on improving post-secondary students’ experience searching for somewhere to live off-campus.</p>



<p>Kwan was familiar with the excitement that comes with finding new-found freedom in university and living with friends near campus. But, finding that dream house wasn’t easy.</p>



<p>“Being a student living away from home for the first time in an unfamiliar city, there was a lot of information to know before signing a lease,” Kwan said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She explains that house hunting is time-consuming and disorganized without a localized space to view rental spaces, neighborhood information, or leasing details. It can also be stressful having to sift through Google searches, Kiji ads, Facebook groups, rental pages, to say nothing of contacting landlords and signing leases. It’s a lot to juggle for a new student who might be doing most of the house-hunting remotely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Why does the process of finding housing have to be so stressful and lengthy?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lemon House consolidates all rental properties suitable for college students, making it easier to find the perfect home near your new campus.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/a_JNalaxAJ_CVbfuDaFnec7zcT_fynjpOVh1BYCtol8YrOLs37Rn8ds_RFZsT-ptB3do7rR8GeqLwf1oTJb92E375NZz5Ek0NCHNt_cTbsFRsNfmf961iASlC6h1LonPmgMgUqhB" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>The Design Process</h2>



<p>As with any good Designer, Kwan started by digging into the data. She found that rental prices were increasing and that the average student spends over five months searching for off-campus accommodations. She then researched the current house-hunting process and interviewed current students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once she began developing design concepts, user feedback became essential and was extremely helpful in refining the design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Asking for feedback [&#8230;] helped with keeping in mind to always re-engage the users. I also learned to apply my own critical judgment to sort out and define the most important feedback to apply towards the design.”</p>



<p>Before beginning the diploma program, Kwan had a limited design background, but she quickly learned to apply the elements of UI and use a grid/spacing system.</p>



<p>“I had to make many iterations of my screens before the final product,” Kwan shared. “It was challenging, but I definitely really enjoyed the process because looking back at my work I can really see a growth in my learning.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PO2AWNgIasbD9q0r0f72w3XdKofrnn5PtyqPMY7rB-L90qsjkX2Ogtk6sxzRPI_1ej5JfXSajPxfqQLY6qVzPyd1SRIPK8txSr_mYd6Qvqf45Q72QIHRe-B86xvx47kORmBehEYY" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Safe to say, the end result is a beautiful example of thoughtful design.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nfIWULIv5Gcw-Mq0nvLk2gxKKpQNir0STAtdR5WtJEQz6MiEct712ICFzoFb49RKe0fIj7QG73FdIEBaf_FQi1l5D6yh8i8oBjmDog2Jd2h-LVAM2oKxnttggTIobV6jqVgiMW_r" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>The BrainStation Experience</h2>



<p>At the end of it all, Kwan is happy with what she learned and more importantly the people she was able to meet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A highlight of my time at BrainStation would have to be meeting and getting close to everyone in my cohort,” she remembers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I learned a lot from the other students as we worked and helped each other on projects. I was also able to glimpse what the data science and web development students do through BrainStation 3D – it was a great opportunity to work with the other disciplines and create a product within a short amount of time.”</p>



<p>Kwan is now ready to take the next step and launch her career in UX Design.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>When entering the field of design, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-of-the-best-sites-to-build-your-portfolio">strong portfolio</a> that showcases completed work is essential to highlight your skills and experience and help you stand out from the crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Makeeda Johnson, a recent graduate of BrainStation’s UX Design Diploma Program presents a great example of a <a href="https://makeedajohnson.com/">portfolio</a> that demonstrates her project flow and design process.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Launching a UX Career</h2>



<p>Johnson was happy with her job as a Finance &amp; Compliance Coordinator at a pharmaceutical company –&nbsp;she was often promoted and thought it was the perfect place for her. But, over time, her perspective changed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HFTdu2hCK-yi3A13K3UE57byRa4cCWWGjT3RRsQUX40u1sPEGGmQk0MxIVoY6ETTVMYlyfjAlGY4jFeoaXO1bNGpsjWUAVuX7b8t9L7577aNu8iIoGuWBcaNk5_yZUQxK89ovsue" alt=""/></figure>



<p>“After a while, I realized that, aside from helping people, I had completely abandoned all the things I was passionate about. After a candid conversation with a friend, he asked if I had considered UX Design and I thought, ‘What on earth is that?’ A few Google searches and workshops later, I fell in love.”</p>



<p>Not to say jumping into UX Design wasn’t a big leap.</p>



<p>“It took awhile for me to make the decision to leave my full-time job to pursue UX, but I knew it was right for me. I just knew that if I applied myself, the reward would turn out to be much greater than the risk. Looking back, I have no regrets and I&#8217;m happy I took the leap of faith.”</p>



<h2>A Design for Travel</h2>



<p>Johnson designed <a href="https://makeedajohnson.com/projects/">Trip</a>, an app to plan your travel itinerary and log your experiences. After traveling, Johnson was often faced with the same onslaught of questions, asking where she’d been, how she rated an excursion, or what venues she recommended, so she thought, “It would be cool to create something that would help facilitate that interaction, somewhere people can&nbsp; see their friend&#8217;s entire trip and easily recreate the experience for themselves.”</p>



<p>Through her experience, Johnson learned three crucial design practices that led her to create a successful project.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GaIPaljhA5-z_fRf5iUWdKNXjr9gTGXtYc9JTxPrCdCl4rNLqUi0Vog4EN4iIPVo8ZP8tFWwVa_F2EiS4MsJmX9_hsW9MsD9uwkzAwI-5FzZSNFxsp7ClrjmGtwuC934arhqf5FS" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>1. You aren&#8217;t the expert, your target users are</strong></p>



<p>Target user feedback is crucial if you want to improve your product.</p>



<p><strong>2. Embrace ambiguity</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes the feedback you get will be as vague as &#8220;I just don&#8217;t like something about the way this feels&#8221; or &#8220;make this better&#8221; and it&#8217;ll be up to you to figure it out.</p>



<p><strong>3. Be confident</strong></p>



<p>Imposter Syndrome is a topic that comes up often and I learned it&#8217;s important to be confident in your design ability. Feedback is very important, but it&#8217;s also important to be able to stand your ground and justify your design choices when necessary.</p>



<h2>Learn as You Go&nbsp;</h2>



<p>User research is an important step in developing user-friendly designs, but it can be difficult to manage all the feedback. Johnson quickly learned that she’d have to prioritize suggestions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My initial strategy was to try and accommodate all the feedback I received. This worked well up until someone&#8217;s feedback directly conflicted with someone else&#8217;s. Going forward, I had to prioritize feedback by asking myself if it was a recommendation based on universal design guidelines or personal preference.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7ugM5_wGF3dFvtsaH4UGMWey2U0YPeXxdTq2i99CKHZbocayfX_fusJs4jnhVc914E13iSAit4virtwovA_8BluTJXzerNdXNL71JWAYgNkG59OS6GPpdwhSHqjt3NTEBF9-1IR8" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now that she’s earned her Diploma, what does Johnson remember most?</p>



<p>“The highlight of my time at BrainStation was definitely the people! I met so many amazing people and formed such great friendships in such a short amount of time. We started out as this shy bunch of people who were afraid to present our work to each other and now we&#8217;re basically like a big BrainStation family.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-dos-and-donts-for-building-a-design-portfolio">Building a strong portfolio</a> piece is an essential part of the BrainStation Diploma Program experience and for good reason; when searching for jobs, it’s important to have completed work that showcases your skills and understanding.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29163137/FloriaChu_2_UX-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11351" width="251" height="251" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29163137/FloriaChu_2_UX-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29163137/FloriaChu_2_UX-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29163137/FloriaChu_2_UX-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29163137/FloriaChu_2_UX-1-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29163137/FloriaChu_2_UX-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" /></figure></div>



<p>We were impressed with the work of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/floriachu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Floria Chu (opens in a new tab)">Floria Chu</a>, a recent graduate of the UX Design Diploma Program, who created a beautiful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.floriachu.com/" target="_blank">portfolio</a> to showcase her capstone project. We spoke with Chu about her design process and experience as a BrainStation Diploma student.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Starting a Career in Design&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Early in her career, Chu knew she had an appreciation for design, but didn’t see herself as having the the skills needed to bring her ideas to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking with other Designers, however, convinced Chu that if she was determined, she could pursue a career in design.</p>



<p>“I knew I wanted to play a bigger part in creating something that would bring positive impact and joy to others. I spoke to a few UX Designers and Product Designers and one thing they would tell me was that ‘the eye to design and the heart to create can be developed over time as long as I was passionate to learn and improve.’ It convinced me to put my hands and mind to the test in UX Design.”</p>



<h2>The Concept</h2>



<p>For her capstone project, Chu created <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Taflo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.floriachu.com/portfolio/traflo" target="_blank">Traflo</a>, an app that makes it easier to find and browse travel recommendations from your friends and family.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t30ZyB7P-py8Oq140RPbMRcPDX2WAmIYNIKeRRhRSAZrboxXA9cQqxELQIFg90o3d8jBtNdbDrHkPpKSZgC8zvkncMdeRf9j16KE3zxaHB1mTGgTCkY2yrEyXZ84hdFBIpcD3s4c" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Avid travelers will know this problem all too well: You book a much-needed vacation and reach out to your friends and family for recommendations. But then, the weeks before your vacation, you can’t seem to remember any of those suggestions or where you wrote them down… if you did.<br></p>



<p>Traflo makes it easier to browse recommendations from the people you trust without getting bogged down by countless travel forums and blogs. You can see a full <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="prototype on inVision (opens in a new tab)" href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/NPWC1P95S4R#/screens" target="_blank">prototype on inVision</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM-1024x767.png" alt="" class="wp-image-11346" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM-1024x767.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM-300x225.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM-768x575.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM-705x529.png 705w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM-960x719.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/29160034/Screen-Shot-2020-04-29-at-11.30.23-AM.png 1314w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“I chose to explore this problem space because it is a topic that gets brought up so often in my chats with others. When it comes to traveling, personally, I struggle with planning and building an itinerary; however, I was curious to know if others around me also felt the same,” Chu said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Design Process</h2>



<p>In planning her design, Chu recognized the importance of focusing on the actual user and dedicating time to research.</p>



<p>“It is so easy to get excited and wrapped up in the idea of building something that suits your own needs and desires, but one key lesson that pushed me to grow as a Designer was learning to put myself in the shoes of the users,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During user research, Chu found that getting feedback from her target audience wasn’t always easy, but always worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gathering constructive feedback was tough to receive but it really allowed me to see areas of improvements within the project, and how small tweaks can make an experience 10 times better.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GrSA8-HMoo7DIs-QWy2XZQerPvpJ1a4nL2uleXxKtkiJRAeIEzzmwCuFKkH60qGv_Z9TF0xLHtRRr2U39sVW8RKIYMLmvpv49E5Ks4HIiXTMSUGS_eDxeurQu9ZFk4l12UuDQGHM" alt=""/></figure>



<p>After 12 weeks, Chu has a completed app and a stellar portfolio of completed work for her job search, all of which was informed by her BrainStation learning experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are so many highlights from a short 12-week program, but one of the biggest highlights had to be learning from Educators from different backgrounds and industry experience. They came from different walks of life that allowed myself and fellow classmates to relate to, and the fact they are so passionate in user experience design helped make this intense program that much more enjoyable and exciting.”</p>

<p>We recently caught up with Dakarai to discuss the origins of the podcast and the impact BrainStation has had on his career. </p>



<p>&#8220;There were so many resources that were given to us from the Education team in terms of portfolio reviews, advice, resume workshops that really prepared me to have that confidence going into interviews. I really credit BrainStation for helping me land a job a couple of months after graduating. I think without them it would have been hard to do all that [&#8230;] on my own,&#8221; he said. </p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Effray is a Digital Communications professional turned Innovation Consultant, who discovered her love for the design thinking process and a user-centric approach when taking BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Live User Experience (UX) Design</a> Certificate Course. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9442" style="width: 251px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9442" class="wp-image-9442" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06.jpg" alt="UX Design Student" width="241" height="388" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06.jpg 1030w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06-186x300.jpg 186w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06-636x1024.jpg 636w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9442" class="wp-caption-text">Summer Effray</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living and working in Kelowna, B.C., Summer wanted access to digital skills training but couldn’t make it to a physical campus location. We spoke with Summer about her experience learning in an Online Live classroom, and how she’s bringing the UX skills she gained throughout the course into her role as Innovation Consultant for the City of Kelowna.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a bit about your education and career background?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straight out of high school, I went to university and successfully completed a Bachelor of Arts with an English major from the University of Victoria (UVic). My first job after university was an administrative assistant with a financial investment firm in Kelowna, BC. After three and a half years there, I knew that administrative work, particularly in finance, wasn’t for me, so I found a new job at a local real estate development company as a development coordinator and then a marketing coordinator. During my short foray into marketing, I realized I was heading in a career direction that better fit my skills and interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pretty much brings me to my career with the City of Kelowna, which has spanned more than a decade. During my career in Communications, I took distance education through UVic to get my Public Relations Diploma, became a full-time permanent employee, was promoted several times to be one of the department’s senior Communicators, became a certified Communication Management Professional and served as a judge for the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) Gold Quill Awards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, I was in the Digital Communications portfolio, managing the City’s digital channels and strategy, which is what lead me to take the UX course from BrainStation. </span></p>
<p><b>Was the UX Design course helpful when moving into your new role?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UX course has served me well and was definitely an asset when I applied to my current position as an Innovation Consultant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that my commitment to continuous learning was one of the reasons that I got my current job. Working with the Intelligent Cities Manager, my job is to support smart city strategies and initiatives, help drive improvements to City service delivery, and foster a collaborative, data-driven and customer-centric culture.</span></p>
<p><b>What was your motivation behind taking the Online Live UX Design Course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to take the UX Design course because it looked like something that would help me in my job at the time as a Communications Consultant – managing websites and advising on digital channel development. It also seemed like a good way to spend some time exploring another potential career path, and I’ve always been interested in design. </span></p>
<p><b>What factors influenced your decision to take Online Live Learning rather than in-person?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I live in Kelowna and there is no BrainStation location here, and I work full-time, the online format was appealing and, honestly, necessary for me to be able to take the course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also received a <a href="https://brainstation.io/scholarships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainStation scholarship</a> and financial support from the City of Kelowna, which – along with the leeway to leave work a bit early on classroom days – enabled me to take the UX course. I am so thankful to have been given the support and flexibility that I needed to continue my education.</span></p>

<p><b>What were some of the most valuable skills you gained during the UX course? Have these skills aided your professional development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about design thinking; being user-centric; and the iterative process of sketching, wireframing, and prototyping. In my previous role, the course helped me to better advise web content providers about best practices, as well as begin the development of a set of online experience standards to help guide the expansion of the City’s digital channels – all while staying focused on the user experience and providing good customer service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Innovation Consultant, I have helped to bring service design thinking and processes to the City, and having some existing knowledge of design and user experience was pivotal in my ability to become a champion for this new (for Kelowna) way of doing things.</span></p>
<p><b>As an Innovation Consultant for the City of Kelowna, what does a typical day look like for you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day is different, but they usually start with some time spent reading about innovation and smart city initiatives and trends around the world. I might also have a meeting with my supervisor – the Intelligent Cities Manager – to regroup on what we are working on and coordinate any follow up that might be required relating to current projects or touchpoints with partners. A bit of each day is devoted to sharing what I’m working on with coworkers and probing to see if there are opportunities for collaboration with other staff or partners in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project work usually ends up being part of my day as well – we’re investigating the feasibility of a number of other initiatives including bringing AI to the City in the form of a website chatbot to help improve customer service and reduce the demand on staff resources to deal with simple, routine questions. I’m also developing and implementing a strategic communications plan to keep stakeholders updated on the Intelligent City Strategy and initiatives, as well as opportunities to work with us. </span></p>
<p><b>Have you been able to incorporate the skills you learned in the UX Design course into your role?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I’m currently working on creating resources for staff to help them adopt service design thinking and become more user-centric when improving or creating new services. Plus I’m involved in two major online service improvement projects that use service design thinking, UX design principles, and agile development methodologies.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you describe the Online Live learning experience? What was the highlight?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Online Live experience was different than other distance education courses that I’ve taken, because it actually felt like you were part of a class. This format was awesome because you’d start out learning about something through theory and then you would get a chance to practice with a real life example or application. I think this really solidifies things for a learner – it did for me anyway. The opportunities to break out into smaller groups during class was also great. Even though the classes were three hours long, they went by pretty fast because they were so engaging.</span></p>
