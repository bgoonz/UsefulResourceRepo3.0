<p>Cover letters, resumes, and networking are an important part of the job application process. But to really stand out and show off your skills, there’s another tool that every digital marketing professional should add to their job search toolkit: the portfolio.</p>



<p><strong>From TikTok to Clubhouse</strong> – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on May 27th, and featured the experts who lead social and digital engagement at <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, branding agency <strong>Sid Lee</strong>, and disruptive beauty company <strong>DECIEM</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a platform for marketing, social media has been growing for years. But while advertising buys are becoming more streamlined (especially with the increase in user and demographic data that social media can provide), achieving valuable organic reach is still elusive – especially as a host of new platforms leaves audiences more fragmented than ever.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s opportunity in these changes. The arrival of new platforms creates new ways to reach potential customers and new ways to interact with them – and as these audiences fragment, it gives marketers the ability to target their outreach more precisely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Into this shifting landscape, 2020 introduced a global pandemic, widespread lockdowns, and massive social protests – to name just a few of last year’s most transformative events. Each of them threw Social Media Marketers another curveball, forcing them to find ways to adapt. But in at least some of these challenges was a chance to connect with audiences in meaningful ways and build digital communities that will hopefully continue to thrive even as the pandemic winds down.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How have recent events shaped the world of social media marketing? What changes can we expect to see in the future, and how to best capitalize on them?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>A.I. Is Becoming Indispensable</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As social media audiences grow and diversify, brands have more opportunities than ever to personalize their outreach to each user for more effective results – but the explosion in data is more than anyone can manage single-handedly. Fortunately, data analytics and A.I. are stepping up to help Marketers understand user behavior and tailor their social media strategies around the actions that will be most impactful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Corissa Henry, Head of Digital at beauty company DECIEM, explains, “Two things that I’ve seen grow quite a bit in importance across all the brands that I’ve worked with have been the roles of artificial intelligence and personalization. And those two are actually quite intertwined. A.I. allows you to analyze consumer behavior and search patterns, and to use that data to help you understand how your customers are finding your products or services. This can then help you personalize how you approach those customers, so you can send the right message to the right person at the right time. What I’ve seen across all of the brands I’ve worked with is this evolution toward focusing in on who your customers are, where they are, and how to speak to them in a way that’s relevant to them, rather than just blasting information at them.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>One Platform Can Host Many Communities</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This deep knowledge of your customers – where they are and how to reach them – is becoming indispensable as social media platforms proliferate; each platform is unique in its tone, culture, and the type of content that performs. But these individual platforms are diversifying as well, becoming home to myriad micro-communities united by interests that range from the fundamental to the highly esoteric.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>TikTok, for example, launched with a relatively homogenous group of users. But the power of TikTok’s algorithm is how quickly it learns what viewers want to engage in, showing them more of that type of content, even in niche categories. In this way, TikTok is able to assemble loose communities along extremely fine-grained interests – which can be gold to marketers who know how to connect to them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“There are hundreds of different communities that exist and operate distinctly on each social platform,” explains Jason Berk, Head of Social and Digital at branding agency Sid Lee. “What started as a pocket of people that created a close-knit, very specific, narrow community then started growing and adding more people….[Today,] it’s lots of different people of different demographics – a thriving LGBTQ+ community, people of color, DIYers, gamers, animal lovers, foodies, cosplayers, people in uniform….There’s a lot of the world that quite often major media doesn’t pay attention to. But they’re on TikTok….That’s really great about TikTok for marketers – if you have something to sell and there’s a specific demo, it’s there on TikTok.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, is the birthplace of many conversations that ultimately take place at a cultural level, be it politics, movies, or something else entirely. Win Sakdinan<strong>, </strong>Twitter’s Head of Business Marketing for North America, explains, “Twitter is the home for very influential people, people who really want to be in the know….That classic adoption curve – Twitter users are always at the low part, as [trends] start, and then it starts to spread out. When you reach these individuals, whether you’re a brand or an individual talking about a certain topic, it spreads fast to other channels. It gets onto the news, goes to Instagram, to Facebook, to Clubhouse, to TED Talks, and everything.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, discussions and trends emerging organically on social media are not a new phenomenon. The trick is how to leverage those conversations.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Social Media Leads to More Casual, Authentic Interactions</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Compared to the traditional ad-buy model where brands strictly control the message they disseminate to the world, social media is much more interactive – which lends it responsiveness and “realness” not found in other media. In fact, a tradeoff exists here: some marketing messages are glossy, tightly controlled, and on-message, while others are more casual and down to earth – and that authenticity means relinquishing some control.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In fact, controlling your message is antithetical to organic growth. For some brands, that’s OK – traditional advertising is still an option. But for brands pursuing more organic reach through social, you can only hope to contribute to a larger conversation, not to control it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Public chat network Clubhouse is one example of a platform where brand messaging must take a backseat, Berk says. “Creating a strategy that will work [on Clubhouse is something] that you can’t really plan for. You can create the bones of a strategy, but you can’t plan the content like you would on other social networks.” For his agency, which works with brands on a consulting basis, this can mean some difficult conversations about whether social is really where they want to focus. “We always ask our clients, would you share this with your friend? Would you send this over to your mom? And if the answer’s no, the question is, why are you doing it, and is social the right place for it?” Berk advises brands to ask, “‘Do you really want an organic social strategy?’ Everyone says they do. They’re like, ‘Well, I want 100 million followers and I want all these impressions and I want people to love us.’ It’s like, OK, then you can’t put your brand first. You have to participate in a conversation.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But for Pamela Saunders, Public Relations &amp; Social Impact Lead at Microsoft, organic growth isn’t about going viral: “Everybody knows who Microsoft is. I don’t need to build a brand – I’m coming at it from a very different perspective. What I learned pretty quickly was that we needed to demystify who we are as a company – what does it mean to people locally? What does it mean to companies locally? Who wants to work with us, with an understanding of what we really stand for? And we found social was a really great place to talk about that. We were able to profile employees. We were able to showcase the kinds of things that we do within our walls, the kinds of work that we do in a really grassroots sort of way….I have the opportunity to be separate from the brand side, where the communications have to be that slick, really pretty photography and video that big brands are known for.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Saunders’s goals at Microsoft are more focused on building relationships over the long term. “For us, success is really when somebody applies for a job here,” she says, “and what they tell us is, ‘I’ve been watching the videos, I’ve been seeing the content, and  I’m really interested in this team because I feel like they align with the kinds of things I want to do.’ That’s where I’m measuring it….Maybe they didn’t share our videos because it wasn’t that type of content, but it really resonated and stuck in their head. That’s super successful for me.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The COVID-19 Pandemic Changed the Landscape</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Henry explains, many brands that reach users by being authentic and approachable got a boost in 2020. “One of the truths of the pandemic is that, in order to be together safely someday, for a while, we had to figure out how to be together apart. Social media stepped in to fill that void for so many people….It’s been amazing to see how, a little more than a year ago, everything was focused on hyper-productivity and consumption, and now it’s all about mental health and well-being. [As a result,] there’s a lot more realness to what the platforms have. And I think that going forward, that is what brands are going to have to adopt. They’re going to have to learn to speak to people on the level that they’re at, rather than having it be like that glossy ad trying to advertise to you.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Saunders echoes Henry’s sentiments: “There was a focus on video a couple of years ago when…we were all building video teams, trying to figure out how to manage it and stay true to the vision that our brands had always had about producing video – really nice looking stuff. Those platforms started to change the way that people were interacting with video. And what we’ve seen over the pandemic is a real lean in to that. We don’t see as much heavily produced content. It’s about being a little bit messy because we’ve all been trapped in our houses and trying to share things and be real because we can’t connect in real life. That has shifted the way we think about using social, and I don’t see us ever going back.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If we can’t go back, how do we go forward? “How do brands shift again, and make it more about providing value as people come out of their cocoons and do things, versus providing value for people while they’re on lockdown?” Berk says. “Now the challenge is, how do brands provide that value to communities and individuals that are not stuck inside anymore, and want to start having experiences again?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This speaks directly to the challenge of maintaining social media’s influence throughout more of the marketing funnel during the pandemic – not just creating awareness, but also providing seamless entry into shopping and even point-of-sale. “Part of [the pandemic-driven shift to social] was that I couldn’t go out and shop the way I used to,” Saunders says. “And I started adapting what my expectations were….One of the things that I’ve seen – and I think this is a shift that you’ll see brands really navigating over the coming year – is we’re all starting to move outside again. But a lot of us have established online shopping or online routines that I think will continue….I want the same kind of closeness that I felt to some of the brands that I’ve been shopping with over the last year….I want that frictionless [experience], I want to go from great content right into the store to buy the thing.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This brings us back to the question of how to leverage conversations playing out online to build organic reach. Using data to meet users where they are and engage with them in a less rigid, more authentic way are two important strategies; another strategy comes down to timing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Seize the Moment</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Social media is driven by conversations, trends, and other content that tends to occur in cycles – meaning it’s a clean slate every day. To get in on that conversation means being flexible and ready to move when an opportunity appears. That being said, not every social media event is an opportunity for marketing; brands have been burned in the past by trying to capitalize on tragedy, simply because the topic was trending. There’s a time and place for brands to add their voice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At Twitter, 2020 was a good example of how challenging that can be. Between the pandemic, the first anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the attack on Capitol Hill, 2020 was a banner year for driving user engagement at Twitter – but none of these events made for a good branding moment – meaning brands had to learn how to co-exist in the same space as these discussions, even though, in most cases, direct participation in them was not appropriate. So even while engagement was up, Win says, “advertising spend dropped dramatically during the start COVID. People weren’t going to be receptive to brand messages. [Over time,] things got a little bit better, and you realized people still need to brush their teeth and drive cars and watch movies and everything. So things came back.” Still, these newsworthy events never stop happening.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One solution, then, is to initiate a conversation. Win uses the example of McDonald’s launching a new Big Mac, this one with bacon. They could simply shout the message, paying for advertising to raise awareness. But for organic reach, McDonald’s could also begin a conversation. “Big Mac with bacon – is it still a Big Mac?” Win says. This leads to debate, which grows reach organically while still keeping the conversation on track to meet the brand’s objective. “When you’re driving conversation, there’s an art and science to it that we’re starting to crack that drives more brand relevance, drives more reach and frequency and organic, and it impacts your purchase funnel, ultimately. But it’s getting that sweet spot.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Berk, opportunity lurks in existing conversations that are brand-adjacent – not making the conversation about the brand itself, but using the moment to introduce yourself. This is especially true of platforms like Clubhouse, where centering the brand is especially frowned upon. Instead, find a topic that’s brand-adjacent and contribute something that’s valuable to users. In the case of the new Big Mac, Berk explains how such a strategy could play out on Clubhouse: “Clubhouse is not a place for McDonald’s to exist, but it could be a place where the chef that helped create the Big Mac with bacon could say, ‘Hey everyone, I created the Big Mac with bacon and it is absolutely a Big Mac.’ People would say you’re sharing something really interesting, and you’re an authority on this, and that’s going to bring people into that room and start a massive conversation. So I think there is a tremendous opportunity for brands on Clubhouse, especially because there’s a lot of white space there.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Henry gives another example of a brand seizing a moment that arose organically on TikTok. “Earlier this week, I got an email from a bookstore chain [with] a series of books that were trending on #BookTok” – a hashtag used by TikTok’s book-loving community, one that has put books on the bestseller list years after they were released. “I’m obsessed with #BookTok, so I instantly clicked on it to see what books they were selecting. I already owned a bunch of them, and I ended up buying a few more. This is an excellent example of a brand capitalizing on a moment where media and culture met in a way that was relevant to their brand without waiting for their particular brand to be mentioned. Because, in the digital space, we always have to have our ears to the ground to be able to strategically pinpoint moments of relevance for our brand. It doesn’t have to be that our brand is specifically being mentioned, but it could be something in the zeitgeist that is relevant to our brand.” </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Henry, a successful campaign is one that “people found valuable and engaged with in a way so that they shared it, in addition to us having paid media behind it. I come to all of my social media campaigns with a single North Star, and that begins and ends with the audience.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cover letters, resumes, and networking are an important part of the job application process. But to really stand out and show off your skills, there’s another tool that every digital marketing professional should add to their job search toolkit: the portfolio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To help you create a digital marketing portfolio, we asked BrainStation Instructor and Shopify Social Media Producer Francesca Saraco some questions about digital marketing portfolios.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here’s why you need a digital marketing portfolio – even if you don’t have work experience – and how to create one that will help you stand out in the job market.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Why Do You Need a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whether you’re looking for a job or you love your job, it’s never a bad idea to have a digital marketing portfolio on the go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“It’s important to have a showcase of your work because you never know when you’ll be asked for it,” says Saraco. “Showcasing your work helps you be discovered by potential employers. Plus, it’s nice to see how far you’ve come, how much you’ve grown and the different trajectories your work has taken.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Keeping an up-to-date portfolio shows that you’re dedicated and engaged, and could lead to new connections or even job offers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>What Is in a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s easy to guess what kind of work a Writer, Designer, or Web Developer might showcase in their portfolio. But when it comes to a digital marketing portfolio, the content might be less obvious. That’s because digital marketing often involves teamwork, strategic thinking, and planning that can’t always be captured in a writing sample or image.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Sometimes people in more strategy-driven roles are more challenged with what they can put in a portfolio because their work is thinking based,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The solution, says Saraco, is to show a tangible product, credit the team you worked with, and then explain what your role was.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example, you could feature a few photos from an Instagram campaign with a caption that describes your role: Did you develop the strategic plan? Write the copy? Coordinate the digital ad buy? Explain your role and how you contributed to the results. Sharing analytics information alongside visuals is another way to highlight your skills (especially for search engine marketing or search engine optimization projects), but be sure you can back up what your role was and how you contributed to success.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>What Do I Include in My Portfolio If I Don’t Have Digital Marketing Experience?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you don’t have any digital marketing work experience, you can still start making a portfolio. Focus first on personal projects and social media profiles, which can be a way to showcase your digital marketing skills and sensibilities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“You can showcase your own content, whether that’s an email newsletter that you write biweekly, or a strong Twitter presence or Instagram presence. That can be shown off in a portfolio to show potential employers how you think and how you create,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you prefer to keep your personal profiles private, consider starting a passion project (like an Instagram or blog dedicated to houseplants or cooking) and featuring it on your portfolio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Digital marketing courses can help in this area, as many will allow you to complete work in a number of areas.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Projects from school are a great portfolio piece to show your thinking process and skills,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Can I Feature Client Work on My Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you do have digital marketing work experience, you might be wondering if it’s okay to feature client work in your portfolio. To avoid any issues, it’s important to ask first.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Simply emailing and asking for consent goes a long way. This is something you can do as your exiting a job or internship, or when a project is complete,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When featuring client work Saraco also emphasizes the importance of crediting others who worked on the project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Don’t take credit for content that’s not yours, that’s really important. There is no shame in crediting collaborators on a project. It shows that you can work on a team,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How Do I Start Making a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To start making a digital marketing portfolio, you’ll want to first find a portfolio website to help you organize and showcase your work. There are currently a wide range of free or relatively cost-effective websites that offer ready-made or customizable templates for online portfolios. Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly are just a few of the options available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember that the portfolio itself becomes an example of your work, so it’s important to choose a platform that you’re comfortable using.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Keep it nice and organized, create a nice user experience and show off your personality,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once your portfolio is ready to go, make it easy to find by adding a link in your resume, on your LinkedIn page, and your social media accounts.</p>

<p>With the rapid rate of change in today’s digital world, leaders must understand disruptive technologies – both those that are currently molding the market as well as those hovering on the horizon – and how to leverage the latest tech innovations to stand out in a crowded competitive field.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But how do you strategize for the future when even the present is in flux? To find out, BrainStation’s panel gathered cross-functional business and technology leaders to break down the most important disciplines, technologies, and trends that any forward-thinking professional should be thinking about in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>A User-Centric Future</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As more and more businesses are wisely trying to prioritize user experience, forward-thinking companies are looking for ways to turn up the volume on customer feedback.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a direct-t0-consumer brand, Peloton is ahead of the pack in this area. As Peloton Director of Product Arjun Gopalratnam explains, Peloton members are uniquely vocal and honest with their opinions. And when it’s time to make decisions that affect its product or experience, Peloton is sure to bring its members along for the ride.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“When you have a brand that has such obsessive loyalty as ours does, people really feel like you are part of their family and they won’t hesitate to tell you their feedback, positive or negative. We use every bit of that to improve the product,” Gopalratnam said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We use that kind of information to figure out which direction we’re going to go.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>User feedback is of course crucial when the company is testing, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We often launch software to a small subset of the population. We determine if it&#8217;s hitting our KPI, whatever we were trying to move. And if it isn&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not shy about pulling it back, maybe canceling that and regenerating it internally and then pushing it forward again.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An important point about being user-centric in 2021 and beyond? Doing so requires considering the needs of all users in all their global diversity, pointed out Sharmeen Browarek Chapp, Twitch’s Vice President of Community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Digital leadership means being conscious of the responsibility that we carry in a world where our online products reach people across the world, across country borders,” Chapp said. “We have to take a global perspective of how we design our products for our customers and have that be at the heart of everything that we do.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>The Era of Data Continues</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In recent years, big data has dominated discussions around business and tech, with companies scrambling to invest in data science and analytics – as well as subset disciplines like machine learning and A.I. – to unlock the power and potential of the reams of data now being collected.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But when it comes to converting all that information into insights, most businesses are only scratching the surface of what is possible. In BrainStation’s 2020 Digital Skills Survey, for instance, 83 percent of data professionals ranked the data literacy in their organization as intermediate or low – and given the ever-growing amounts of data being collected, that data literacy gap needs to close, fast.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“If you look at IDC data coming out of Internet of Things sensors – that could be a sensor on your tire or a traffic light or on a boat in the ocean – the data that’s coming in there has now increased four hundred percent. That means that in the last year, 56 billion connected devices will generate 79 zettabytes of data,” said Sandy Carter, Vice President, WWPS Partners and Programs for Amazon Web Services (AWS).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We are seeing a gap, but a resurgence in the focus on data. We’re seeing more and more organizations try to utilize data in the cloud to make better business decisions,” she added.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Whether an organization is a large enterprise or a small business, this data-led approach – especially as you’re digitizing – will turn out to be more and more important.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Meanwhile, forward-thinking companies are also already thinking about the effect any new privacy laws or regulation could have on the collection of data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“In the age of increasing privacy policies, the traditional methods brands used to target audiences are slowly becoming obsolete,” said Keith McLeod, Vice President, Marketing Operations, The New York Times. “I personally think right now that for brands, that’s the No. 1 thing we’re thinking about: how we will operate in the future without using cookies. You really can’t talk to your customers in the future in the way we know today.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>No Process is Safe from Scrutiny</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sometimes, being forward-thinking requires taking a long look at what you’ve done in the past.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That was true for The New York Times. As McLeod explained it, the company has transformed itself and remained effective and efficient in part by constantly re-evaluating its practices and processes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Let me set the table for everyone who might remember The New York Times as the old grey lady – at this point, it’s more than just a core newspaper or digital asset. We have products in cooking, games, we also have ventures in TV like <em>Modern Love</em>, working with Amazon. So it&#8217;s a huge entity. It&#8217;s a media company now with over seven million subscribers,” McLeod said. “As it pertains to innovation, when I think deeply about it, it’s not just technology innovation.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We spent a good part of the year essentially just doing addition by subtraction. We were decommissioning various tools and platforms that really no longer met our strategic initiatives,” he added.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Really, our commitment and dedication to process and process re-engineering is part of our DNA.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>A Hard Look at Soft Skills</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When looking ahead to an uncertain future, it’s tempting to focus on the hard, technical skills that will surely be needed to leverage the latest leading-edge technologies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But several leaders on BrainStation’s panel pointed out that the most essential quality for thriving in an ever-changing landscape is actually a soft skill: curiosity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“I actually lean more heavily on the soft skills than the technical skills,” said Gopalratnam. “I think empathy and experimentation and understanding of other people is so important in order to push any of our organizations forward.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Along with that, I would describe curiosity as being really key and kind of indicative of whether someone is going to succeed or not.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Carter agreed that an inquisitive nature is a quality most digital leaders seem to share.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“On average, we as adults only ask about 10 questions a day, but all of these digital leaders ask hundreds of questions a day,” said Carter, citing research in the book <em>The Creator’s Code: The Six Essential Skills of Extraordinary Entrepreneurs.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“If you’ve ever been in a narrative review with Jeff Bezos, you know that’s true – he wants to know everything. He’s curious,” she continued. “I do believe that a digital leader needs to have digital literacy and the soft skills of curiosity to really breakthrough with those new disruptions that digital enables you to do.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Lessons From the Pandemic</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No company could really have planned for the pandemic, so the recent health crisis tested virtually everyone’s ability to adapt and adjust.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Browarek Chapp explained, the lessons learned during this time are too valuable to be ignored.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“In this new world of digital leadership, we have to be flexible. The pandemic put us in a situation that nobody would have anticipated, but it&#8217;s also taught us that we can work remotely and we can still be successful companies driving change across the world,” Browarek Chapp said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“I really encourage everybody to think about how in a future where things might be going back to normal, it&#8217;s going to be a new normal. It&#8217;s not the one that was before. And so how do we want to adapt the way our teams work together to build great products for customers? And what does that look like moving forward?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Others on the panel agreed that, with help from work management platforms, having employees working from home hasn’t hurt productivity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Frankly, we&#8217;re actually delivering and getting products and assets out the door faster than we actually were in person,” McLeod said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong>Building Digital Loyalty Programs That Work </strong>– the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on November 5th, and featured three experts from McDonald’s Canada, Brooklinen, and Ritual Vitamins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/476406905" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>The humble loyalty programs of yesteryear – the era of “buy nine subs, get your tenth sub free” – have come a long way in the digital age. Today, consumers have many more ways to interact with brands, including in bricks-and-mortar stores and pop-up locations, curbside and delivery, on websites and social media, and through newsletters and SMS. Each of these touchpoints represents an opportunity to implement a loyalty program with the goal of gleaning valuable data and, ultimately, driving consumer habits.</p>



<p>We spoke with three executives overseeing ambitious and highly diverse loyalty programs – for McDonald’s Canada, Brooklinen, and Ritual Vitamins – about how loyalty programs are changing, how they can be a key driver of customer experience and customer insights, and their best advice for making a loyalty program work.</p>



<h2><strong>Every Loyalty Program Is Unique</strong></h2>



<p>Unsurprisingly, different brands need different things from their loyalty programs. One of the key determiners here is the timescale at which purchases are made.</p>



<p>At McDonald’s Canada, for instance, Digital Director Adam Cooper oversees a loyalty program to drive daily purchases, which grew from an offline rewards card where every coffee purchased earned a sticker. “A few years ago, we replicated the paper program within our mobile app,” Cooper says. “Results are strong. And when you couple it with something like a reorder feature, which increases the habitual nature and the ease of coming to McDonald’s, the value proposition is pretty strong.”</p>



<p>Allie Donovan is Director of Email and Retention at Brooklinen, a D2C provider of bed linens and other homewares; unlike at McDonald’s, her customers may go months or even years between purchases, meaning “loyalty” needs to be measured differently. For&nbsp; Donovan, loyalty is less about habitual behaviors and more about building a strong relationship. “We think that relationships have to be the very center of the marketing that we do,” she says. “We have to acknowledge that our customers are helping us – we’re very grateful for their business and we have to give them something in return.”</p>



<p>Loyalty also looks completely different at Ritual Vitamins, where everything is retailed through a subscription model. As Director of Customer Lifecycle and Growth Laura Brodie explains, repeat sales are built into the subscription plan, so the goals of the loyalty program are very different: “We look at our customer lifecycle on a monthly basis, based on how long they’ve been subscribed, and we do lots of research as to what questions our customers have at what point in their tenure.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because loyalty programs are bespoke, they always begin with research – ROI being a prime consideration – and clear objectives. How do you define “loyalty”? What is your priority – retention, higher average order value (AOV), more customers? And are you sure you know what your customer hopes to get out of it?</p>



<p>Depending on the market, “there could be years between purchases,” says Donovan. “We had to think about the signals that tell us you’re a loyal customer. Frequency and AOV can be very interconnected. But there are also signals like, are you coming to our site? Are you looking at the information we give you? We really think about retention and loyalty as one.”</p>



<p>Your definition of loyalty will shape your program in many ways. Some programs, like the typical points system, are highly visible to the customer. But some programs operate in the background. “As you’re there longer, you’re getting rewarded,” Donovan explains. “Even though you may not know it, you’re seeing surprise and delight offers come through, not knowing that you’ve earned them because you’ve ordered a certain number of times. Some people really want that challenge of points and rewards, and others want to be much more passive – but they still want to be acknowledged.”</p>



<p>Especially in long-timescale programs, there may be a temptation to reward bad behaviors in an attempt to entice customers to reactivate – but this should be approached carefully. “We want to keep the relationship between what we pay for a customer and their lifetime value in check,” Brodie says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The solution is to find incentives that work for your specific customer base – which could be as simple as a customized product recommendation, demonstrating that you understand their needs. There are many ways to appeal to your customers besides discounts: exclusive offers, content or events open to members only, including programming or a house publication, or pre-sale access to high-demand products; convenience, like the ability to pay through an app rather than waiting in line; bonus offers like free embroidery or engraving on a purchased item; free samples or gifts; and personalized or tailored content.</p>



<p>In fact, one way to boost loyalty is to incorporate customer feedback into your product development cycle – showing them their input is valued while also making your products more appealing to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>UX at The Core of Loyalty Programs</strong></h2>



<p>All the touchpoints mentions above – physical stores, curbside and delivery, online and social channels, email newsletters and SMS – correspond to a different stage of the customer journey, and as such, are part of the same UX.</p>



<p>“The power is in the consumer’s hands,” Donovan says, “whereas 10 or 20 years ago, they just didn’t have the choices that are available now, everybody really is your competitor. A bank is something very different from the homeware sheet business – but you might go to a bank’s website, and they have smooth transitions from all their pages and you can get exactly what you want done. When you have a great experience like that, you suddenly expect it from everybody. If anyone is clunky and old-fashioned, it jars with you.”</p>



<p>Experience is key not only to attracting repeat customers, but also to building trust – whose importance to growing a business can’t be overstated. As Brodie explains, “We equate trust with loyalty. And trust is based on so many things, especially with a product in the health space. Once you earn that trust, you unlock the ability to do a lot of different things in your customer experience. When we get customers to trust us, it means that, one, they’ll stay with their habit. But two, they’ll look for more and more from our brand. That’s what loyalty really is.”</p>



<p>In other words, loyalty programs are not just a carrot to entice customers to spend. They’re about building relationships by showing customers that you value both their business and their feedback, and being responsive to what customers want from your business. This also relates back to incentives: some customers are looking for a monetary reward, but community-building and showing customers they’re being heard can be equally powerful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A loyalty program can reward far more than just making purchases, too. Donovan explains, “We designed our program in a way where you earn points for everything that you buy, as well as for some of the other activities that we want you to take, maybe liking us on Instagram or giving us your birthday – things that are very good indicators of your loyalty.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, there are several ways loyalty programs can teach you more about its members.</p>



<h2><strong>Loyalty Programs Provide Customer Insights</strong></h2>



<p>Besides incentivizing specific behaviors – both habitual ones as well as one-time actions like completing a survey or writing a review – there are at least three ways a loyalty program can yield insights about customer behavior: once when the points are earned, again when the points are redeemed, and finally, when customer behaviors are analyzed in aggregate.</p>



<p>The first phase, when the customer is racking up points by completing different rewarded behaviors, reveals what actions a customer is taking (or not taking), giving you a window into where there’s room for growth. “We get some really interesting trend lines on transactions, retention and habitual use,” Cooper explains. “If we see you buying coffee every day, but we see that you never use the reorder function on the app, maybe we can start sending emails to say, ‘Hey, have you seen this feature? Have you seen the value? You can now get your coffee in four clicks.’ Similar to if we see you buy Happy Meals but you never use curbside service for mobile ordering.”</p>



<p>The way points are redeemed can also be a window into customers’ values. Once you’ve earned points with Brooklinen, Donovan says, “you can spend them in three ways: you can redeem them for a coupon, you can exchange them for a free item –different levels, different amounts, and you can have lots of different items – or you can donate your points to Habitat for Humanity New York, which is a really nice way to give back and have the customer feel that they’re being part of the charity effort.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these touchpoints are opportunities to peer into the mindset of individual customers. But taken in aggregate, these behaviors can also reveal new patterns in statistical data. “We get top-line, high-level data on just how many people are engaging with our digital experience and our loyalty programs,” Cooper says. “Where we go from there is retention and turning profitability on for every offer, and the programs at large. When you can do the math on that, it really is a huge opportunity. Especially during the pandemic, when we’ve had to close the inside of some restaurants, there’s been an opportunity in how loyalty can help – knowing the customer can actually help us to get them into a curbside spot or open up mobile ordering to them. Having that relationship with our guests, knowing a little bit about them, has allowed us to see where we can convert to help drive the business.”</p>



<p>Brodie confirms the value of this data. “We recently went through and audited our survey process to make sure that we really were learning about the customer at every stage, and not having it really loaded toward onboarding, for example. We look at tons of different touchpoints, and then we can also look at engagement within their account. Are they snoozing their order, are they changing their delivery date? Are they taking an active role in managing their subscription?” This can feed directly into top-level business strategy: “We work super collaboratively with our product and data teams, as well as our customer insights team. The main starting point is, what are we learning about our customers at each stage? Then we’ll take survey data and match it with the behavioral data we’re seeing in terms of product usage and metrics like retention. Only once we bring all of those pieces together do we try to formulate recommendations, and that will go into the development of more formal features and things that the product team would work on.”</p>



<p>“I always think of a retention and customer relationship management team like a central hub of the company,” Donovan adds, emphasizing the importance of these insights to all levels of a business. “Everyone either wants something from you or you need something from them. It’s at the center of what everyone’s doing.”</p>

<p><strong>Tech Defining the Future of Work </strong>– the latest panel in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on October 8th and featured executives from League, Fiverr, Prudential, and Microsoft. </p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>

 </div>




<p>Technology was already transforming the ways we work, both as individuals and as companies, long before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. When offices emptied out earlier in the year, this process was greatly accelerated, which created daunting new challenges – and a few opportunities. The need to adapt the ways we work and the focus on digital continues to this day, and will persist well into the future – even long after the pandemic has ended.</p>



<p>We spoke with four experts – from Microsoft, League, Fiverr, and Prudential – about how they’re leading the monumental shift toward more dispersed ways of working, both for their employees and for the clients they serve.</p>



<p><strong>Embracing Tech Is No Longer Optional</strong></p>



<p>As the pandemic drives workforces to disperse physically, technology has stepped in to keep us connected. The demand for tools like teleconferencing and cloud storage may seem obvious in hindsight, but that doesn’t diminish the challenge of rolling them out rapidly, and at scale.</p>



<p>As Jordan Sheridan, Modern Workplace Lead at Microsoft, explains, “Remote work isn&#8217;t exactly new in 2020, but this is the first time that everybody’s had to embrace it: … What tools do we need? What security considerations do we have? … How do we connect, collaborate? Helping our customers put the infrastructures in place that will allow them to [work remotely] was the biggest challenge about scaling that infrastructure. In April, our CEO said that we saw about two years of acceleration in two months.”</p>



<p>Gil Sheinfeld, CTO of freelancer marketplace Fiverr, agrees with Sheridan. “Since COVID started, the world has been forced to work differently. Remote work and digital transformation are not optional, but mandatory. We’ve seen increased demand for all sorts of business services, especially for e-commerce related services. And also from many businesses who need to transform their business from the offline world to the online world.”</p>



<p>Sheinfeld’s observation speaks to a less obvious demand for new digital tools – namely, ways to help deliver traditionally offline goods and services with the online customer service users have come to expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every organization is now starting to shift into a technology organization,” says Shradha Prakash, VP Future of Work, Org Design and Talent Enablement at Prudential. “Customers want that one-click experience. And it’s very difficult to replicate that. Businesses that were previously based on relationships, now, suddenly, are more about convenience, more about bringing that same experience to a digital platform. And if we need to provide those kinds of technological enhancements, what are the processes we need to change, and what are the structural implications of it?”</p>



<p>Susan Van Klink, CRO of the health benefits hub League, sees the silver lining in the rush to move services online. “In the accelerated move to the cloud, companies are looking for consumer-centric, personalized, engaging solutions that employees will use.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In League’s field, virtual health care, the pandemic has accelerated that shift “by about a decade,” Van Klink says, “in terms of access to mental health care, access to physical health care, and access to third party solutions that will help people manage their health better. We see all of this as a great thing – but it’s really exposed the need for companies to have a digital footprint and an infrastructure.”</p>



<p><strong>Technological Change Drives Organizational Change</strong></p>



<p>A dispersed workforce, cloud-based tools, and online customer service affect not just the way individuals do their jobs, but also the ways entire organizations operate. One of the first demands this shift placed on businesses was for drastically improved agility.</p>



<p>Van Klink says, “COVID has revealed a lot of gaps in the current system, as it relates to accessibility, lack of data, direct correlation to business continuity, and having a healthy workforce to drive your business forward.” Each of those gaps represents an opportunity for businesses to embrace new ways of working.</p>



<p>Prakash concurs. “It opened up the world for us. Leadership sometimes didn’t have exposure to remote working or virtual environments, and that was constraining their thinking. And suddenly it was like, ‘Oh, now I can actually work in different time zones, I can work out of different cities, I can work out of different talent clusters.’”</p>



<p>That decentralization has translated into deeper changes to managerial structure. Whereas business strategy once came from the top down, a decentralized workforce armed with the correct collaboration tools can generate strategic insights at every level. The result is improved talent enablement, similar to the Japanese concept of <em>kaizen</em>, where business activities are continuously improved by all employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Talent enablement means helping your [people] lead and drive business strategy to produce outcomes,” Prakash explains. “It’s a collective, democratized way of ensuring your talent understands how the work is done and what it requires to get work done.” While this was often outsourced to consulting firms in the past, a more decentralized, democratized workforce means that “everybody in the organization should be responsible for doing it.”</p>



<p><strong>Human Problems Require Human-Centered Solutions</strong></p>



<p>Businesses are, after all, made up of people. But while the problems WFH poses for business are different from the ones we face as individuals, digital tools offer ways to help us adapt.</p>



<p>A major pitfall of working from home is the loss of community – those chance encounters that not only give rise to unexpected opportunities for collaboration, but are also integral to employee’s mental well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was an organic ability to connect the dots over water coolers and during restroom breaks and in corridors,” Prakash notes. “There was a time when people would meet in the cafeteria and talk about their kids and dogs. Suddenly, that’s losing out, because we don’t bump into each other on a digital platform.”</p>



<p>At League, Van Klink says, they’ve turned to digital tools like Donut to stimulate serendipitous conversation, replicating what happens organically in an office. “The tricky part is maintaining that social connection,” she says. This was especially true in the case of new hires. “We had to create a whole new process around virtual recruiting and onboarding that would help convey the culture of the company without the face-to-face component available to us.” Even social media platforms like Instagram are useful in maintaining visibility to employees and customers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to recruitment efforts at Microsoft, Sheridan says, “We’ve had good success with things like breakout rooms. Instead of a traditional hackathon that you’d do in person in a large room, we set up breakout rooms and send people into smaller group interactions to get that same feel of how they’re interacting together.”</p>



<p>Maintaining a sense of community online – a trend well underway even before the pandemic – is one thing. Addressing the mental strain unique to remote working is quite another. As Sheridan explains, “Your brain actually processes differently as you’re participating in a video call than it would if you were on a conference call or sitting in a meeting room. Technology overload is definitely taking its toll in different ways.” Microsoft Teams has responded by allowing people to sync their teleconferencing backgrounds, “to make the meeting a little bit more engaging, make it feel a little bit more natural, and try to bring down that fatigue.”</p>



<p>Another contributor to fatigue for the WFH set is the gradual blurring of work and home. Counterintuitively, doing away the morning and evening commute hasn’t improved mental well-being; it’s only allowed the stresses of work to bleed into home life. In response, Sheridan’s team has been toying with a virtual commute, “to create that demarcation between the work environment and the home environment” and allow people to shift gears, decompress, and compartmentalize.</p>



<p>Ultimately, our experts are optimistic that we will collectively learn how to regain the benefits of the physical office – the separation of work and home, the sense of community, the ability to collaborate and find spontaneous connections – without losing any of the advantages that remote working offers – like access to a broader talent pool, opportunities to relocate, improved agility, and more input from across a company’s org chart.</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>New Rules of Marketing: Creating Stand-Out Content </strong>– the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on September 17th and featured executives from&nbsp; La Colombe Coffee, Chobani, Condé Nast, and Unbounce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>

<p>The average adult picks up their phone 58 times a day. That is 58 opportunities for brands to capture a user’s attention, build brand awareness, and convert a user. Today with increased competition and increasingly discerning consumers, it’s never been harder for brands to stand out. How do you create “thumb-stopping” content that breaks through the noise?</p>



<p>We spoke with content marketing experts from La Colombe Coffee, Chobani, Condé Nast, and Unbounce to see how they’ve adjusted to the COVID-era.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Let Data Lead the Way</h2>



<p>If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s the value of data, particularly when it comes to testing new mediums, channels, and forms of content.  </p>



<p>Lloyd D’Souza, the Executive Creative Director/Head of Content Development at Condé Nast, reveals that the company’s brand-building initiatives lean heavily on the work of its editorial teams, who often have already experimented with new and emerging platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We get the data from them and see what works&#8230;and apply that to how we work with the brand,” he said, giving the example of the audience Self Magazine has cultivated on TikTok.</p>



<p>“Self has essentially created a whole kind of brand voice on TikTok. Their approach to sexual education, and how they talk about it there, is incredible&#8230; and what they&#8217;ve done is applied an authentic voice&#8230;to give information to a Gen Z audience that&#8217;s looking for sexual health education,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They&#8217;ve created an audience that considers Self an authority on this, and&#8230;we&#8217;re looking to do that with all our brands.” </p>



<p>Data can also be leveraged to identify opportunities on the product development side. La Colombe Coffee, and its Draft Latte product line, is a good example.</p>



<p>“We launched oat milk into our cafes and within days saw such a huge shift; tons of people going towards putting oat milk into their coffees,” said Kathryn O’Connor, SVP, Marketing at&nbsp; La Colombe Coffee, explaining that  this user data encouraged the brand to start serving draft latte with oat milk at their retail outlets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using market intelligence, the brand realized that ready-to-drink coffee was one of the fastest growing segments in the beverage category. The company sense an opportunity for a canned oat milk draft latte and applied their data-driven approach to develop a strategy. </p>



<p>“We look at an overlay of the category development across the country, the brand development index across the country, where we&#8217;re seeing these early adopters of alt milks, where we&#8217;re seeing ready-to-drink pop on the radar and then layer that with where our distribution’s high, and where the media is available. We then use all of those pieces to help inform our go-to-market strategy and our marketing strategy,” O’Connor said. </p>



<h2>Adapt and Repurpose Content</h2>



<p>As consumers become more media savvy, and with more channels and mediums than ever, content marketing needs to now include a mix of content, which organizations should be ready to repurpose and adapt for different parts of the marketing funnel.</p>



<p>“Our content mix changes kind of annually based on business need so we choose quarterly objectives that our marketing is going to focus on, or the direction that we want to go, and then our content is derived from those objectives,” said Jennifer Pepper, the Director of Content Marketing at Unbounce, explaining that her team creates a matrix of content gaps.</p>



<p>“We take a look at our different profiles or audience members and ask, do we have a customer story here? What do we need at the top of the funnel? We take a look at that and where we need to create in certain areas versus maybe the most sexy things – you know like everybody wants a branded show, everybody wants a podcast – but really making sure you have that foundation set from the start is really important,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to O’Connor, La Colombe Coffee follows a similar approach, with a focus on creating a mix of paid and organic content that leans on taste appeal and aspirational imagery.  The key, she says, is being ready to adapt. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re constantly revisiting it&#8230;does it still sit? Does it still resonate? Has something happened that we need to react to – especially the past six seven months have shown us there&#8217;s a lot to react to – so we are always revisiting and it has to be flexible.”</p>



<h2>Balance Purpose With Product in Stories</h2>



<p>Over the last few years, there has been a lot of importance given to “purpose-driven marketing”&nbsp; – the idea that consumers want their brands to be aligned with a cause or purpose – partly because consumers today are more discerning than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for Eddie Revis, Vice President of Brand, Marketing and Media at Chobani, purpose-driven stories have to be measured out equally with good old-fashioned product marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You have to balance both, because you&#8217;ll never have one without the other successfully,” he said, explaining that Chobani has worked hard to avoid a trap many direct-to-consumer brands fall into, where you “have no idea who the company is and you don&#8217;t know what they stand for and you don&#8217;t know what their story is and why they exist.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, Chobani recently announced it was donating all profits from a new limited-edition flavor (Chobani Greek yogurt PB&amp;J) to Feeding America, a nationwide network of food banks that provides food to people in need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s a product story we&#8217;re talking about with this great product – this healthy nutritious yogurt that you can go buy – but it&#8217;s driven by our purpose and who we are as a company,” Revis said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Embrace the Power of AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Marketing today isn’t only about building brands through amazing content. It is also closely measured by its impact on business growth. And to deliver high-converting content, more and more marketers are leveraging AI and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was a skeptic of this myself because I thought that sounds too futuristic,&#8221; Pepper said, &#8220;but where you used to be confined to testing this versus that, or a split test where you&#8217;re sending traffic to a landing page that&#8217;s basically equally weighted in all cases, we have now developed things like smart traffic, where instead of fiddling around with your ad platforms you can you can create tons of different variants of your campaign message to strike the right tone with different portions of your audience,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not about you making those decisions anymore – you can actually hand that over to machine learning, which I think is really exciting because it does feel futuristic but it&#8217;s basically this giant easy button.” </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>Evolution of the CMO Role with Vimeo’s Harris Beber</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> –&nbsp;took place on August 19th, and professionals around the world tuned in to hear Beber&#8217;s thoughts on the fast-changing marketing field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/449733902" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>A Chief Marketing Offices (CMO) is someone who oversees all marketing activities within an organization. In the last few years, the CMO role has started to evolve, with professionals needing to implement new digital strategies and processes, all while overseeing business growth and user experience.</p>



<p>We spoke to Beber to find out more about this evolution, his career trajectory, and what skills he thinks are most important for marketers, today and in the future.</p>



<h2>How Do You Become a CMO?</h2>



<p>Successful CMOs today need to be versatile, with a range of expertise and skills. To develop these skills, it’s often necessary to become students, in a way, of their business and industry. Beber has adopted this approach throughout his career and believes it is essential for anyone aspiring to become a CMO.</p>



<p>“Don’t be afraid to take a different path&#8230;I raised my hand for every cross-functional project. I wanted to understand how the business worked because…that made me better. It’s ok to take a step to the right, to take on a different challenge that deepens and expands your knowledge because that will make you a better marketer,” he says, adding that entrepreneurial and startup experience is invaluable in a similar way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you&#8217;re two people in a basement, you don&#8217;t have a team of resources across different functions; You are that team&#8230;and by wearing so many hats, you become an operator of a business and understand what drives the business forward, which has served me as a marketer,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How Has the CMO Role Evolved?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Traditionally, when people think about marketing, they imagine big, fun brand campaigns. Now more than ever, though, marketers are also being held responsible for revenue and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The blessing and the curse of marketing is everything you do is measurable. It&#8217;s very clear to see the impact of most things, and whether it&#8217;s working or not. And you&#8217;re held accountable for that,” Beber says.</p>



<p>“Delivering growth while also becoming profitable is no small feat, but what it instills is understanding what you need to do to succeed, what are your KPIs, and then how do you build promotions, tactics, and strategies that deliver?” he says, adding that adaptability, both individually and organizationally, is essential, as things can and will change quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our world is dynamic, it’s changing on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis&#8230;If you’re doing your job well, as soon as you have it figured out within a matter of weeks or months it’s not figured out anymore; the world shifts. Think about what Google Search was 10 years ago and now it’s table stakes and you’re really optimizing to even make it profitable because everyone’s there,” Beber says, explaining that brands can avoid common pitfalls by adopting a data-driven approach and always remembering their purpose and how they provide value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Executing on the fundamentals will give you your scale and your day-to-day, but where you can be ahead of the game, where you’re seeing trends and tapping into them, those can create opportunities for incremental growth that you’re not thinking about,” he says,&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Flawed CMO vs. CIO Debate</h2>



<p>Over the last few years, the lines between CMO and Chief Information Officer (CIO) roles have started to blur. While the latter is typically responsible for implementing digital solutions and processes on an organizational level, these are often directly related to marketing initiatives, which fall under the CMO’s purview. This has created a debate around who exactly should be &#8220;owning digital.&#8221;. According to Beber, though, the premise behind this debate is flawed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“if you answer that question, you&#8217;re doomed to fail because <em>everyone</em> has to own digital. The best companies that I’ve been in share accountability. At Vimeo, product has a responsibility for building products that serve a real value and deliver value. Marketing’s responsibility is to raise awareness, demonstrate that value to the target users, and drive adoption. It’s a one-two punch; it doesn’t work without both of us,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What Marketing Skills Are Most Important Now?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to break into digital marketing, there are a number of technical “hard” skills that you can develop to gain an advantage on the job market. But for Beber, the rapid pace of change in the digital space means that these are often less important than a strong work ethic, a solution-oriented mindset, and an ability to think outside the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People who know how to solve problems and think creatively about delivering solutions are the most valuable people on any team&#8230;It’s not about the function they were hired for, it&#8217;s the solutions that they can deliver for any challenge that we face as a business,” he says, explaining that these are the traits he looks for when hiring for his own team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to have really smart people with high aptitude that look at problems and say, ‘how am I going to solve this and come up with creative solutions to tackling the problems of the future.’ Those are the people that will always have growth and a career path.” <br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>How D2C Brands Are Defining The Future of Retail,</strong> the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on August 6th, and thousands tuned in to learn more about how some of the world’s leading D2C brands are defining the future of retail with new marketing, design, and data strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/446613160" width="640" height="361" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>Direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies have exploded over the past decade, setting new standards for user experience with innovative retail and marketing strategies. In the process, they’ve disrupted entire industries and forced traditional retailers to play catch-up.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at how some leading D2C brands started and how their approach to marketing is helping them grow.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Focusing on Personalization and Personal Connections </h3>



<p>Beekeeper’s Naturals is an innovative wellness company that develops nutraceutical products from plant-based ingredients. The company grew out of the personal experiences of Founder and CEO Carly Stein, and that has helped it differentiate itself from others natural and organic products in the health and wellness category.</p>



<p>“I started this company because I have chronic tonsillitis, coupled with an allergic reaction to basically every over-the-counter medication. I can’t take antibiotics … I was chronically ill, and I couldn&#8217;t find solutions in the natural aisle. I found there was a real disconnect between natural ingredients and efficacy plant-based formulas, and that’s what Beekeeper’s Naturals is all about,” said Stein.</p>



<p>The company’s initial marketing strategy involved seeking out others facing the same challenges and connecting with those struggling with similar medical obstacles. Stein and her team would attend conferences on Celiac’s Disease, find those with allergies and compromised immune systems, and engage with people in chat rooms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How that’s evolved over time is that we basically found these very early evangelists, found the demographic that needed the product that we had, connected with them and have found different ways to work with them,” she said, adding that many “early evangelists” now work with the company on Instagram and as affiliates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Rami Helali of Kotn, a fast-growing Canadian clothing retailer that sells ethically made products, followed a similar approach when first starting out. While Beekeeper’s Naturals targeted specific conferences, Kotn took to the press with a highly personalized approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the insights that I had early on was we needed others to tell our story, others with legitimacy&#8230;and for us, that was people in the press,” he said explaining that the company contacted a list of over two thousand editors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I wrote a personalized email to every single one of these editors&#8230;and, you know, I sent thousands of these and got probably like six responses. And out of those six responses, probably got two articles.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s very much putting yourself in that uncomfortable position to get that first push, because often one of the hardest things to do is go from not-existing to existing&#8230;it requires doing things that don&#8217;t scale,” Helali said.</p>



<h3>Embracing Omnichannel Marketing</h3>



<p>Many leading D2C brands started digital first, but digital-first doesn’t mean digital-only &#8212; D2C&nbsp; brands often find value interacting with their customers in real life to create a cohesive omnichannel experience crucial. Helali emphasized the importance of understanding each of your channels and prioritizing what works for your brand.</p>



<p>“You may be doing 10 things, but find one or two things that really resonate with the customer,&#8221; he says, adding that it’s important to understand what each channel is supposed to do for your marketing stack and sticking to channels that work for your brand.</p>



<p>“I think there&#8217;s a danger in just saying, oh, new channel, new channel, new channel, and not mastering one single channel at a time and understanding your unit economics and how that works for your business,” he said, explaining that building a consistent and transparent brand story comes down to three essential pillars: “understanding your customer, understanding the channel, and understanding what message resonates with what channel is really important to get that cohesive feel across all those channels.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Siobahn Sweeney, a Sales Leader at Shopify Retail, believes that embracing an omnichannel approach can help create a seamless shopping experience, which can make a lasting brand impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I think about delivering a really seamless shopping experience, I think about wanting to provide something that’s unique depending on where that customer is interacting with my band, and yet consistent. So, I think it’s really important for brands to embrace this whole idea of omnichannel. It’s about creating a single customer experience across your brand in all those channels and touch points along the way.”</p>



<h3>Taking Advantage of the Data&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A data-centric approach to retailing and marketing is one of the fundamental shifts over the last few years –&nbsp;and in particular the last few months – and D2C brands have been on the forefront of this movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We measure everything from how a specific customer group acts over time to how products do in-store vs. online,” said Helali. “All decisions stem from data and then putting the processes in place so that you’re interpreting that data correctly and taking the actions that are required.”</p>



<p>This granular use of data is how many D2C brands have managed to reach and understand their audience on a deeper level than brands before – and there are many resources available to newly founded brands. Shopify, for example, empowers merchants to use data with their own set of analytics tools.</p>



<p>“When it comes to our merchants that work with us, we have quite a robust amount of data that we are able to share with them from a reporting perspective,” said Sweeney, adding that Shopify uses data in-house as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We use data to inform our marketing strategy the exact same way that we do our product team,” she said.</p>



<p>Stein added that those leading a D2C brand will benefit from thinking adopting a data-driven approach early on, as major retailers look for these numbers when stocking their stores.</p>



<p>“When you are moving into the retail environment as a D2C brand, more and more retail stores care about this data, they are very aware of your metrics on every social platform, and it feeds into your pitch in a big way. So capturing that data and having that structure early on allows you to move into different directions in a really seamless way.“</p>

<p>The <strong>How Brands are Winning on TikTok</strong> panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on July 22nd, and thousands of professionals tuned in to learn how leading brands have adopted the world’s fastest-growing social media platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/440998240" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>In Q1 of 2020, TikTok was downloaded more than 315 million times worldwide, which is the best quarter ever recorded by any app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform is known for its unique style of video – including dancing and voiceover comedy – and has become a key channel for digital marketers to reach Gen Z customers. Much of its growth is down to its simplicity – it is arguably the easiest social media platform to use when it comes to video editing, using music, and adding filters – and the fact that’s impossible to put down; TikTok’s algorithms quickly learn user preferences by capturing likes, comments, and time spent on each video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as with any new social media platform, there is a steep learning curve for brands hoping to create content that feels natural and engages users. And when attempting to connect with the most media-savvy generation in history, this can be trickier than ever before.</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways leading brands are building their brand on TikTok.</p>



<h2>Create for TikTok</h2>



<p>Chipotle was the first restaurant to partner with TikTok in the U.S., and the brand has been praised for its use of the platform through campaigns like the #GuacChallenge and #ChipotleLidFlip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latter was a “challenge” that asked TikTok fans to dance to a song by Dr. Jean about guacamole. The campaign was successful because it felt organic and natural to the platform, mixing music, dancing, pop culture, and a sense of silliness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were the first restaurant brand to do a hashtag challenge, and 59 thousand people ended up doing the lid flip,” said Candice Beck, Senior Manager, Social and Digital Marketing at Chipotle, explaining that the brand has also run TikTok-specific campaigns on National Burrito Day, among others. “We often find pretty big success when we can align a brand moment with a cultural moment like that,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chipotle’s efforts have paid off; they now have more than 800 thousand followers and 11 million likes on TikTok.</p>



<p>“We get so much more engagement on TikTok than other social channels. It’s by far a priority channel for us,” said Beck, explaining that her team has daily 15-minute meetings to discuss content for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are really coming to TikTok right now for happy content. I go there to get some of that uplighting, fun, user content that’s been necessary to bring a bit of joy recently&#8230;we’re using our channels pretty similarly. We’re not using organic presence for PR so much, even driving new products. We’re taking insights that we’ve learned from the platform itself and applying that every time we share a new piece of content.”</p>



<p>Jason Berk, Head of Social and Digital at Sid Lee, believes this is the best approach when it comes to developing a content strategy for TikTok.</p>



<p>“What I constantly tell [clients] is you cannot repurpose your content from other platforms on TikTok. Not only will not work; it’ll backfire. It needs to be quick, relevant content as well. There needs to be a willingness to move fast,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Understand What TikTok Is</h2>



<p>You might think TikTok is nothing but teenage girls lip-syncing in their rooms, but according to Berk, you would be mistaken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tiktok is not a singular platform with a reputation, it’s a lot of different communities and a lot of different people talking in a lot of different ways&#8230;I think that’s the reason why it’s become this de-facto trend factory. Once something goes big in a community, it catches fire and everyone supports that,” Berk said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaleb Ruel, Head of US Consumer Marketing at Spotify, explains that this trend-setting ability makes TikTok stand out from other media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“TikTok is a place where we go to participate in that cultural narrative, and success looks a lot different in that sense. We’re not looking at the same media metrics and bottom line impact on the business,” he said, adding that Spotify has seen success mixing organic and paid media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The biggest lesson for us is that when you have a TikTok challenge alone it’s fantastic, but when you have a challenge that’s coupled with other harder driving media, like larger ad placements that are more marquee, that’s when we see the highest impact.”</p>



<h2>Focus on Authenticity&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Another way TikTok has stood out from the crowd is for the supposed “realness” of its content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Instagram is hyper-filtered and the content that brands partner with there tends to be as well. TikTok tends to be the complete opposite. I’d say authentic and raw are common terms that I hear,” Ruel said.</p>



<p>Berk agrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of realness on TikTok – like the LGTBT community coming out and talking about their stories. That creates solidarity and it’s a little more serious, it unites a community,” he said, adding that this creates an unvarnished, safe place. “On Instagram you have to look your best, you have to be the prettiest, you have to be the envy of your circle of friends. On TikTok, it’s a little safer to show some of your fears and concerns and losses and some of these universal emotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>TikTok may, therefore, feel riskier than other platforms from a brand’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think every brand belongs on TikTok. I think you really have to know your brand ethos and what you stand for and how you stand for it. The ones that do a good job are unapologetic about being there,” Ruel said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most successful brands on TikTok are also vigilant about keeping up with trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The team is constantly mining for UGC about Chipotle, new trends, new insights, specifically on TikTok&#8230;we’re looking for any new posts from other users that we can comment on or anything we should repost or a trend we should consider. So, we’re in deep,” Beck said, adding that this shouldn’t scare brands away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get on there experiment, see what your followers like. [&#8230;] Don’t be intimidated by creating the perfect video; we’ve found a lot of success with some of our comments on other people&#8217;s posts about Chipotle. It’s not about creating the perfect TikTok that meets Gen Z’s liking.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Berk, it all comes down to remembering what you’re trying to do: make videos to connect and have some fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Make the channels and start putting videos out. A lot of people on my team have become pseudo influencers&#8230;It doesn’t cost a lot to make these kinds of videos, so I would say just do it.” <br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>Designing Great Experiences in a Digital-First World </strong>panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on July 9th, and professionals around the world tuned in to discuss the way brands have adjusted their design strategies in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/436946085" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>The pace of digitization has sped up over the last few months, forcing entire industries to adopt new digital strategies. How have the world’s best brands, Designers, and digital product owners adjusted to an increasingly online-only world?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few ways leading brands are designing great experiences in a digital-first world.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Embrace Design Thinking </strong></h3>



<p>Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, some of the largest organizations in the United States saw the potential design had to spur innovation and drive growth. Capital One, for example, acquired Adaptive Path, a San Francisco-based design and user experience consultancy, in 2014. Since then, Capital One’s design team has grown to more than 500 Designers across the US, which changed the company’s approach and prepared it for the challenges of the last few months.</p>



<p>“Capital One’s commitment to design thinking, and how we approach a problem, benefits everyone – We all should be approaching problem-solving with open arms,” said Klaus Heesch, Director, Experience Design at Capital One, explaining that he and his team follow three key design principles, which have influenced the company as a whole.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“Be helpful and human – listen to your users and lead with empathy. Be harmless – do no harm. How safe are we keeping them? We have to be fair and just, we can’t just be fair. And finally, have contextual awareness. We need to understand and articulate the thing we’re solving for, to the systems and people who support it,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutterstock, a leading provider of stock photography, stock footage, stock music, is another example of a company that has doubled down on design as it grew, creating a culture of experimentation and innovation that is led by its Designers.</p>



<p>“We have an amazing UX team and they really just drive the conversation, from the tiniest spark of an idea to a full-fledged product that it ends up becoming. They’re curious, they’re talented, and great communicators, which from a director-level, makes it easy to support their ideas,”&nbsp; said Erin Essex, Shutterstock’s Director of UX and Product Design.</p>



<p>“Shutterstock helps foster this culture of creating a safe space where we can really spitball ideas and ideate quickly. We really do that from the lens of what is helpful to the customers, what is achievable, and how can we push those boundaries,” she said.</p>



<h3><strong>Be Agile and Adaptable</strong></h3>



<p>Harvard Business Review studied large organizations during a downturn and found that 14 percent actually accelerated growth and increased profitability. The most successful companies shared a few common traits:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>They all looked for new opportunities, understanding that their core products and services may have changed</li><li>They developed strategies that could better serve their customers, knowing that their customers (and their behavior) may have changed</li><li>They invested in products and services that helped their best customers when they needed help</li></ul>



<p>The New York Times, for example, recently pivoted its design roadmap to accelerate new features and projects, including expanding free access to high school students.</p>



<p>“We have an existing program with Verizon where students at Title 1 schools have free access to The Times and we thought, what if we could expand access? We had two weeks to completely launch something, so we reprioritized; We had more than 100 people come together across functions to work to double access to 14 million people,” said Tracie Lee, Product Design Director at The New York Times, adding that despite the urgency, a long-term lens is always required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was an immediate user need but it was also an opportunity to think about that relationship. Through user research we hear that people are exposed to The Times in school, so it&#8217;s a much longer game. It&#8217;s about that whole entire journey; a lifetime journey,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jason Mante, Founder and GM at Google’s Area 120, believes that to establish agility and adaptability, organizations need to cultivate an environment where change is not feared.</p>



<p>“[An essential skill set is] the ability to just change your mind and be okay and open with that. Be able to say ‘hey I&#8217;m changing my mind because I believe this new approach is going to better align with what we&#8217;re trying to do,’ Whether it&#8217;s the vision or the values that we&#8217;re trying to offer or not,” he said, adding that organizations can further facilitate adaptability by implementing structure and conventions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Define and build out a shared language amongst you and the team. Spending time upfront to make sure that you’re not constantly having to clarify language can help with decision-making.”    </p>



<h3><strong>Listen to Your Users (and Follow the Data)</strong></h3>



<p>The brands that have best adapted to the “new normal” are those that have adopted a data-driven approach to design and product development. Shutterstock is a case in point. </p>



<p>“We saw customer behavior shifting to the pandemic, at first they were searching for the virus itself, and in a couple of weeks we saw it shift to zoom backgrounds and things like that, and now the topics have shifted to homeschooling, education, and remote learning.  In looking at these trends … we were able to quickly ramp up groups of images that were related to these keyword searches,” said Essex, adding that Shutterstock has also used data to optimize web pages.</p>



<p>“Sometimes there&#8217;s those legacy things on the site and you think, ‘I don&#8217;t know if I want to fight for that right now,’ but it&#8217;s worth it. On native apps alone when we changed [the save] icon we saw an 86 percent increase in engagement,” she said, explaining that it’s always important to look outside the “standard” data channels.</p>



<p>“Consider data that might be overlooked, [&#8230;] go after things that you otherwise might be scared to go after and look outside the norm.”</p>



<p>Mante urges caution, though, arguing that the relative ease of new digital products can sometimes muddy the waters. </p>



<p>“I think the biggest challenge with these digital products is [that] because they&#8217;re so easily buildable there can be less care and and less commitment to clarity in it because it&#8217;s like ‘well we can fix it later,’” he said, adding that the key is always remembering who your products are for and why you’re creating them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Focus on the value that you&#8217;re offering. If you are opening a product or a feature and that primary value offering that you guys care about as a company is not screaming at the customer, you messed up – somebody didn&#8217;t say no somewhere.”</p>

<p>The<strong>&nbsp;How Brands Are Winning With Data-Driven Marketing&nbsp;</strong>panel discussion, the latest in&nbsp;<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on June 24th, and professionals around the world tuned in to discuss the impact data has had on marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/432352130" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>The exponential growth of online consumption in recent months has made marketing all the more competitive and nuanced. Now the world’s best brands are relying on data to identify new market opportunities, develop and measure marketing initiatives, and optimize campaigns and content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today and in the future, leveraging data for your marketing will keep you ahead of the competition and help you to cater more directly to your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways brands are benefiting from a data-driven marketing approach. </p>



<h2>Limiting the Guesswork</h2>



<p>2020 has forced many organizations to accelerate digital transformation initiatives, particularly in marketing, where digital channels and eCommerce have taken center stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve transitioned from an era where marketing was an art and now it’s definitely a science,” said Deborah Tampubolon, the Director of Marketing, Customer Acquisition at Home Point Financial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As marketers, we’ve always had to be very good storytellers, and now it’s not a question of understanding just the story to tell the audience, it’s the story of understanding what the data is telling you,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jeremy Silkowitz, the Director of Ecommerce at L&#8217;Oreal Luxe, agrees and believes that a more data-driven approach has taken the guesswork out of marketing ideation, helping brands better tailor marketing to their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What are their shopping behaviors? Where are they engaging? What is working and what is not working? Taking that approach and applying it, we can make sure we’re getting results,” he said, adding that data-driven marketing allows for ongoing optimization.&nbsp;“We’re constantly scrutinizing product pages and looking at analytics to see where conversion is low and how we can quickly make adjustments.”</p>



<h2>Showing Measurable Results</h2>



<p>Marketers who use data to track and measure performance can better direct campaign efforts, adjustments, and demonstrate which channels will result in the best return on investment. For example, the volume of email marketing sent across industries increased by 26 percent in the last three months, with open rates and conversions up by 31 and 22 percent from this time last year. Data like this can help marketers get ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>“First and foremost, [data] has made every marketing dollar more accountable,” said Rahul Chowdhury, the Head of Marketing, eBusiness at RB. “We ask ourselves every day, ‘is this moving the needle?’ When you start doing that, you quickly see that search and social media have been elevated,” he said, adding that the rise of data-driven marketing will only increase the amount of testing and experimentation. </p>



<p>“Data-driven marketing has moved us from an era of MadMen to being able to truly test and learn; to get insights by understanding consumers and customers better,” Chowdhury said. </p>



<p>Silkowitz agrees, explaining that L’Oreal has experimented with increased video content and paid social advertising over the last few months, but always keeping an eye on performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everything needs to ladder back to an expectation in return, in making sure that we&#8217;re going to get a return out of any decision to invest time and money. So we develop business cases to understand, as we make these optimizations, what will it trigger – increased engagement or conversion – and then we’re able to track that on an ongoing basis to show that those changes were impactful,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Testing to Define Long-Term KPIs</h2>



<p>A Marketing Week study found that only 24 percent of B2B marketers run campaigns that last longer than six months, a trend that may have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and the need to cover short-term losses.</p>



<p>In <em>The Long and the Short of It</em>, authors Les Binet and Peter Field suggested that while short-term tactics are important for sales, growth and profit are driven by long-term tactics like brand building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting a data-driven approach can help in this regard, encouraging a longer lens and a culture of experimentation, both of which allow organizations to identify trends and gaps in performance over time. </p>



<p>“We&#8217;re testing and launching every single week because every week there&#8217;s something new to learn. It&#8217;s too easy to say I&#8217;m going to plan X weeks of a campaign and then I can go on my virtual vacation, but you can&#8217;t do that – there is no rest for the marketers,” said Tampubolon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Nothing happens overnight; it takes 30-60-90 days if you&#8217;re lucky to see real changes,” she said, adding that a long-term approach often requires a mindset shift.  </p>



<p>“It&#8217;s an advantage to have a view on what you expect your sales to look like, what budgets you think you’ll have,” Silkowitz added. But, he also warned that long-term planning needs to be flexible and adjust on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plans can change quite significantly vs. what we thought our business was going to look like, but the ability to react quickly, adapt, and shift resources is critical as you experience changes.”</p>



<h2>Continue Learning</h2>



<p>In the end, continuous learning is a job necessity for marketers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The digital space is so quickly changing that you never get a grasp of it,” Chowdhury said, adding that as we rely more on data, it can mean rethinking strategies from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can professionals stay ahead in a data-driven world?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Skills can always be acquired and BrainStation is a great example of that,” Tampubolon said. “But we also need a mindset shift. We used to have big picture thinkers and small, on-the-ground thinkers, but now people have to be flexible and think big <em>and </em>small. We&#8217;re in a global economy now.”<br></p>
