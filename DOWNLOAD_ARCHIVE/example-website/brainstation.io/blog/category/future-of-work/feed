<p><strong>Women in Digital Leadership | Shaping Stronger Pathways</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 25th, and featured a stellar lineup of women in digital leadership representing Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics and Instacart.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/529460562" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>



<p>As the tech industry grows, women are making up a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before – but much work remains to be done. While equitable participation across the industry as a whole is a laudable benchmark, it’s not enough. Representation in every job category and at all levels of seniority remains a challenge. Many of the obstacles to better representation in digital leadership are structural, and will require structural changes to fix. Fortunately, there are programs in place, and as their success in helping women achieve positions of leadership grows, so too does the opportunity to kick off a virtuous cycle. </p>



<p>The event lineup included six women in positions of leadership at prominent global companies: Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics, and Instacart. Together, our panelists weighed in on the importance of the initiatives already in place, issues that still need to be confronted, and what can women do as individuals to advance themselves and others in their careers. These are just a few of the many great points that arose during our discussion.</p>



<h2><strong>Mentorship Is the Key to Bridging the First Step</strong></h2>



<p>The transition into management can be an especially difficult one for women – an early inequality that can impact women’s careers over the long term. Shelli Brunswick, Chief Operating Officer at The Space Foundation, explains, “As you’re looking to make that first step on the ladder to being a leader, finding a mentor, a champion, and a coach can be critical..”. She also emphasizes the importance of paying it forward, saying that “once you have a mentor, always remember that you can be a mentor to and help the next generation behind you.”</p>



<p>Often, finding a mentor begins with networking. As Vice President of Product Innovation at Verizon Sanyogita Shamsunder says, “Be open, be collaborative, communicate, go talk to others about their projects and show genuine interest in their work. And get help. The first person that you approach may not may not be open or receptive, but don’t give up. Keep talking to people, both men and women, junior to you, senior to you – it doesn’t matter. We need to communicate. There’s no substitute for that.”</p>



<p>But besides being open to all networking opportunities, what can we do to find mentors – especially the right ones? To start with, it can’t hurt to ask. “You should always be looking for people that you have an affinity with, who really believe in you, and who are willing to go to bat for you when times are tough,” says Frida Polli, CEO &amp; Co-founder of A.I.-powered recruitment platform Pymetrics. “You definitely need to be reaching out to those folks…Just continually be looking for folks that appreciate and believe in what you’re doing.”</p>



<p>Still, approaching a possible mentor can be intimidating. As Tehmina Haider, Vice President and Head of Harry’s Labs at Harry’s Inc., says, “When you ask someone to be a mentor, you’re asking them for their time. The more senior they are, the more precious their time is. So it is a big ask, [but] most leaders actually enjoy seeing other people grow; that’s why they became leaders.” And overcoming your reluctance to approach mentors will pay off: “You need folks who can supplement you in different ways, to have that diversity. Women, because they tend to identify with other women, do often reach out to a female mentor, but you want your mentors to have different points of view than you do. And that’s where pushing for those male mentors is really, really important. So take that leap.</p>



<p>Vice President of Digital &amp; Cybersecurity Solutions at Mastercard Sukhmani Dev concurs, and emphasizes that finding a mentor is sometimes a question of timing. “Things happen organically as you grow forward. I find that [potential mentors] need to have a sense of who you are and what you’re capable of, and have seen you in action…If I really enjoyed working with a boss of mine, and then I’m changing roles or they’re changing roles, I may ask them, ‘Let’s continue the dialogue.’ It was more of a formal ask when I was more junior…but [where I am now], you just call them up when you have a question.”</p>



<p>Darrah Joy-Clay, Account Director of CPG Brands at Instacart, encourages women to ask for what they need. “As I’ve grown in my role, I find that the negotiations become a lot more complex. And when I’m going through a negotiation, of course I consult my female mentors. But it’s my male mentors who really give me that extra level of confidence, and re-emphasize not to be shy or fearful of making an ask of what I’m deserving of, or what I need to be happy and fulfill my role.”</p>



<h2><strong>Support Isn’t Just a Relationship – It’s Also a Culture</strong></h2>



<p>Advocating for yourself is important – but so is advocating for each other. How can companies help to support their female employees and foster a culture that supports women? Several panelists mentioned how important it is to carve out space for women to speak, to encourage them to speak, and to draw attention to their contributions and successes, which can get overlooked in environments structured around male authority. As always, mentorship is important. But even the way we provide day-to-day feedback can help, though criticism can be hard to receive – and to give.</p>



<p>As Haider explains, delivering criticism is about “making sure that the women on your team understand that the feedback that you’re giving them, even if it’s sometimes not that great to hear, is coming from a place of really caring about them. And that’s really hard, as a leader. Giving difficult feedback is not the easiest thing to do, but you’ve got to invest in it, and you’ve got to make sure that folks understand why it’s actually an indication of how much you care.”</p>



<p>For Joy-Clay, that’s aided by an environment where leadership is able to be transparent and talk about their own successes and failures without fear of judgment. “When I share my journey to leadership and I’m transparent with my teams, they can identify and relate with some of the experiences that I’ve had,” she says. “Several mentors of mine who have, one, shared their personal journey with me. But secondly, they’ve exposed me to communities and to rooms and to opportunities that I may not have been in before…and that exposure, I think, is a huge opportunity for leaders and mentees.”</p>



<h2><strong>Policies Need to Acknowledge There Are Many Paths</strong></h2>



<p>While cultivating a supportive environment may seem like an enigmatic exercise, it ultimately comes down to the policies a company puts in place. As Shamsunder says, “One of the first things that we have to do to create programs [to support women] is to recognize that there is an inequality.” This often starts with highlighting the different ways that people contribute to the company – including people with different levels of educational attainment, people in different locations.</p>



<p>There are many paths to STEM, and overlooking some in favor of others is detrimental to employees following unorthodox paths, which often includes women. At Mastercard, Dev explains, “We have a particular program that [assists] women who want to change their careers midway through – nurturing that and helping them explore different areas, explore technological areas.”</p>



<p>Spreading opportunity around isn’t as simple as promoting women up the corporate ladder. And it doesn’t happen by accident. At The Space Foundation, Brunswick says, they take a multi-pronged approach specifically designed to tackle the problem from different angles: raising awareness of careers in STEM, providing more people with access and training, helping to connect potential STEM workers to opportunity, and finally, mentoring to encourage equity in leadership. “Our goal at the Space Foundation is to highlight all those career paths. And we would say it’s about diversity and inclusion, but those underrepresented groups could be rural communities or inner cities, as well as regions of the world.” Matching protégés to mentors is an important step, but it’s just one of many; promoting more women into digital leadership roles in STEM means nurturing an entire talent pipeline that begins with reaching out to girls early in their education and letting them know that they can find a place in STEM.</p>



<p>And more women in STEM is good not only for women: “What we’ve learned is when women around the world are empowered to be entrepreneurs, they elevate not only themselves but their families and their communities as well,” Polli says. “It’s valuable to our entire world and ecosystem to empower women, to provide them the financing and support them in becoming entrepreneurs.”</p>



<h2><strong>Confidence Can Be a Greater Obstacle Than Competence</strong></h2>



<p>Confidence looks different in different people, and in situations with a gender imbalance, women may be at a disadvantage. Here, leadership can help to rebalance the scales, for example, by specifically calling on younger talent to speak up. “Leaders have a key role to play. If you’re on a table where you have young talent and they’re not speaking up, it’s your responsibility to pause and ask them for their point of view, create a space that they feel comfortable in…We can just take two minutes out of our time as leaders to convey that to younger talent. You’ll make them that much more comfortable and confident going forward and feel like their voice is appreciated,” Dev says.</p>



<p>For that younger talent, learning to overcome fear&nbsp; takes practice. “One [strategy] is to give more time and attention to your emotional skills, in terms of developing yourself and your emotional responses to rejection, to negative consequences,” Joy-Clay advises. “If we develop that muscle, that emotional response will be less fearful of what the consequences are on the other end.” This becomes ever easier the more willing leadership is to make space for failure and drop the expectation of perfection. “We have to start speaking more about our failures,” Joy-Clay continues. “If we talk more broadly about the mistakes we’ve made, the failures we’ve had, that would empower more young female leaders to not be afraid to fail, and not be afraid to be their authentic selves in the workplace.”</p>



<p>To Polli, it’s less a question of having confidence and more about how men and women project their confidence differently. “What it means to look confident is actually a very male image,” she says, explaining that what may seem like a lack of confidence is actually a decision not to project overconfidence. The solution is “more about having enough women in positions of leadership that can present an alternative image of what confidence looks like, rather than everyone feeling like, ‘I need to fit the mold of male confidence.’”</p>



<p>On one hand, Haider says, “It’s about pushing women to be confident, be bold, and really demonstrate that confidence externally. But it’s also about changing the metrics that we have around what confidence is, so that the way women show up also feels resonant.”</p>

<p>Miami&#8217;s Digital Future: Success in 2021 and Beyond – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 24, and featured four of Miami&#8217;s tech titans from <strong>Softbank Group International</strong>, <strong>Cisneros</strong>, and <strong>aïre ventures</strong>, and special guest Francis Suarez, <strong>Mayor of Miami</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/528967739" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Miami’s digital landscape has exploded over the past few years, especially in 2020 as global companies continue to tap into Miami’s unique ecosystem of highly-qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>Our Vice President and General Manager of BrainStation Miami, Johanna Mikkola, connected with Leigh-Ann Buchanan from <strong>aïres ventures</strong>, Adriana Cisneros, Chief Executive Officer at <strong>Cisneros</strong>, Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at <strong>SoftBank Group International</strong>, and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, to discuss how Miami can capitalize on this unique moment to ensure prosperity for businesses and tech talent.</p>



<h2>Turning Miami Into a Tech Hub</h2>



<p>During an active moment on social media, where people were discussing the possible future for tech in Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez typed four words that would shift the conversation for good: How can I help?</p>



<p>“I had no expectation that it would be the kind of viral sensation that it was,” said Suarez about his offer to help promote technological growth in the city. “We have been trying to systematically create a tech ecosystem in Miami for the past 10 years. Changing the reputation of a city is like moving a cruise ship&#8230;. I felt like I went out there and got a bunch of tugboats and just dropped them onto the cruise ship and just turned it as fast as I could.”</p>



<p>Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at Softbank International Group, recently moved to Miami himself, and is excited about what the city has to offer. “We kind of understand that when you have a confluence of technological shifts and geography that&#8217;s ready, you get really explosive outcomes.”</p>



<p>“It’s been fun to see when you have a lot of smart people living in the same area,” said Adriana Cisneros, CEO of Cisneros. “The local initiatives, universities, and professors who are in touch and very smart people wanting to help up [Miami’s] game.”<br></p>



<h2>Be Intentional With Inclusivity</h2>



<p>With the increased buzz around South Florida’s budding entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is then the issue of accessibility for those wanting to participate. Leigh-Ann Buchanan emphasized that diversity, equity, and inclusion opportunities don’t happen by accident. They require intentional and frequent communications in order to design the right solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is so much that we can do,” Cisneros added. “There is the notion of inspiring by example. We shouldn’t do things to tick boxes, we should do them because they’re good for business and are the right thing to do.”</p>



<p>“We have a blank canvas as we grow the ecosystem at a feverish pace,” said Suarez. “But to create an equal playing field is to empower particularly children&#8230;and adults who are supposed to have the same set of tools. We need to support organizations that are working and creating opportunities in an equitable fashion and Miami has the opportunity to get it right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the needs and the current technical abilities, there are, however, a few gaps that need to be addressed to support the growth Miami has the potential to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no talent gap, but there is a skills gap,” said Nyatta. “[Softbank is] focused on bridging that digital skills gap in Miami. But there is also a permission gap, as ecosystems that are centred around entrepreneurship often don’t give permission for young people to take risks. This has been the secret sauce of Silicon Valley, giving people permission to screw up and unlocking that permission is the most powerful thing a person can do for growth.”</p>



<p>With post-graduate programs focused on providing digital skills training and Miami becoming a study destination for students, Cisneros is excited to see what is in store for the next wave of workers.</p>



<p>“Miami is still a new city. I’ve heard people say it’s like a silly putty in that you can shape it into what you want it to be. People want to hear about what you&#8217;re working on. Compared to other cities, it&#8217;s genuinely welcoming and you don’t need to have money or power to be accepted into a group you&#8217;re interested in.”<br></p>



<h2>Embrace the Global Yet Local Opportunities</h2>



<p>Buchanan described Miami as a visionary city in what it can support and what people can bring into the community. As it relates to digital talent, Mayor Francis acknowledged there is more than training alone that needs to be done to further Miami’s digital future.</p>



<p>“Our infrastructure [needs to] keep pace with the growth that we’re innovating,” he said. “We obviously want to focus on continuing to make Miami affordable, not just through public private partnerships on affordable housing, but making sure that we have continued supply of housing and which thankfully we do.”</p>



<p>Physical infrastructure plans have also included having direct flights to Asia, which would make Miami one of the most accessible American cities.</p>



<p>Nyatta noted, “A lot of the Miami talk has been about Miami and the U.S: Miami versus Silicon Valley, Miami versus Austin. The discussion I haven&#8217;t heard as much, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s happening is Miami is a global metropolis&#8230;Miami is Hong Kong. Miami is Singapore. Miami is Dubai. It is a culturally situated city with very powerful cultural dynamics that are super interesting and unique and specific and authentic with global potential, with a global airport, with global access.”</p>



<p>With his sights on international connections, Mayor Francis is already thinking ahead on how Miami can get involved with the next generation of verticals such as deep machine learning, Cryptocurrencies, and HealthTech.</p>



<p>“We want to be positioned to be the city that is most forward thinking,” he said. “What that means is as our children grow, they have permission to dream, succeed, and fail and have the ecosystem to support that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think this focus on talent is important,” said Cisneros. “Of course good companies always attract talent, but it&#8217;s also very cool to be able to grow the talent from the 305. It’s good for them and it’s good for the city.”</p>



<p>Nyatta noted that while the energy and excitement is excellent fuel, there needs to be continued strategy year over year to solidify the success Miami is poised to achieve.</p>



<p>“This is not even a marathon, it&#8217;s like an ultra marathon. Maintaining intention and strategic clarity over decades is actually the trick, not just a couple of quarters of buzz. Finding ways to build that intentionality into institutions that outlast political cycles, that outlast fund lives is the trick. I think trying to embed these ideas as much as we can into things that will outlive us is the task at hand rather than let&#8217;s just create a lot of attention right now.”</p>



<p>Mayor Suarez agreed, adding that an effective long-term plan starts with preparing Miamians for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The truth that we all understand is tech is here to stay. If we want to create an equitable economy, we need to provide the right tools and opportunities for people to access those tools.”<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Great Acceleration</strong> – the latest instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series &#8211; took place on February 25 and featured leaders from <strong>Peloton</strong>, <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>KraftHeinz</strong>, <strong>Snyk</strong>, and<strong> Betterment</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the recap here:</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/516922129" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p></p>



<h2>Forming Digital-First Teams</h2>



<p>Following the unprecedented challenges 2020 presented to the world, BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Skills Survey looked to explore the state of digital transformations and what companies could be doing to build upon existing efforts to embrace a digital-first culture.</p>



<p>The survey found that digital acceleration shows no signs of slowing down, as 77 percent of organizations said they plan to increase their digital transformation activities and 80 percent said there are digital elements of their business that did not exist even two years ago.</p>



<p>Dipti Salopek, VP of People at Snyk said, “All companies are software companies now. Anything you consider standard retail is now e-commerce. It was going to be the way of the world and COVID just accelerated it.”</p>



<p>Global stay-at-home orders also saw the acceleration of remote work and the growth of international teams.</p>



<p>Brittany Forsyth, Chief Talent Officer at Shopify, spoke to Shopify’s policy for their employees of working “Digital by Default” early in 2020 to allow all team members to work remotely indefinitely moving forward.</p>



<p>“Working remotely had some challenges but it democratized interactions,” said Salopek. “Every participant and speaker and the same amount of voice and space, which made their all-hands meetings more engaging and collaborative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel, however, stressed the importance of gathering the right data –&nbsp;only this way can you identify and leverage the advantages presented by a digital-first work culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You need to have access to the right data in order to analyze it and make informed decisions,” said Serena Huang, Head of Global People Analytics at Kraft Heinz. “That is the starting point to know where you’re starting from and then you can understand what skills you need.”<br></p>



<h2>Know the Skills Already On Your Team</h2>



<p>More than ever, companies are now required to innovate to meet changing customer needs at the right time, and to deliver the right solutions.</p>



<p>Tim Brown, VP of Talent at Peloton, learned the importance of pressure-testing their own infrastructure after Peloton saw such hyper-growth in 2020 that it strained their existing supply chain. They now are able to find where their limitations are within the existing structure, and how to then overcome those limitations.</p>



<p>“You need to be able to get the right data as [your organization] continues to grow,” said Brown. “You could have 10 great Engineers, but if you don’t have a good Designer, all the work the Engineers did won’t translate to your customer.”</p>



<p>BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey shows that a key trend among respondents was that they felt their organization would be more successful with more data skills. What many companies fail to recognize, however, is that they often already have the skill sets they’re hiring for within their organization in unsuspecting positions.</p>



<p>Most companies can’t answer simple questions like how many people know Python really well. They may know how many Data Scientists they have; but your best Python knowledge-holder may work in finance,” Huang noted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know the scale of abilities already within your teams, you can create meaningful employee engagement opportunities by pairing a person’s skill set with their unique professional development goals. You can also look past technical competencies to find other ways that employees can add value to their team, including what Huang called ‘leadership skills,’ or soft skills, that are often developed in previous experiences.</p>



<p>“Learning agility seems to be an indicator of success compared to most other skills,” said Salopek. “The ability to step out of your comfort zone to try something new, and having the confidence to fail is a sought after skill to support digital transformation, especially for existing and emerging leaders.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Learn Today to Lead Tomorrow</h2>



<p>75 percent of executives who responded to the survey said they believe digital skills training would make them more successful.</p>



<p>Susan Justus, Senior Director and Head of Talent Development at Betterment, has been piloting a number of initiatives using design thinking that are geared towards emerging leaders and managers to keep learning.</p>



<p>“We believe in knowledge sharing,” said Justus.“We had the data analytics team present to other teams on how to better work with data analytics as not everyone thinks from an analytics mindset.”</p>



<p>Looking inward to create these learning opportunities provides insight for the hiring process when needing to source skills from outside your organization.</p>



<p>“When hiring teams, you have to look at the skills but also the competency,” said Brown. “How long would it take someone to learn the skills versus to bring someone on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huang agreed: “You need to find the right skills before you find the right talent. Be clear on the skills you need for your company to succeed.”</p>



<p>The Digital Skills Survey found that there are a number of emerging roles that can have a big impact on organizational growth, which employees can land by upskilling in key areas. These include: Artificial Intelligence Specialist, Experience Designer, Product Owner, Site Reliability Engineer, Cybersecurity Specialist, and Big Data Developer.</p>



<p>“Anything related and obliquely related to software development, including UX and product design, is going to be in demand for the foreseeable future,” Salopek added.</p>



<p>Marketing and Development are also the two disciplines that organizations are planning to hire the most in 2021, leaving lots of opportunities for those looking to enter the tech sector.</p>



<p>Huang noted that while creating opportunities is good, creating the culture and space for employees to take advantage of the initiatives is imperative. “A lot of people are also struggling to find time to learn because they feel very busy,” she said. “How can learning be part of the workday and to create a culture that motivates learning, and having X percentage of time devoted to failing and learning from it if it doesn&#8217;t succeed.”</p>



<p>Justus added, “A lot of people are experiencing a different challenge with their home or work situation and are looking to find ways to meet people where they are to keep a growth mindset at the forefront.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The one constant the panelists know for sure is to continue expecting the unexpected. </p>



<p>People that develop digital agility and continue future-proofing their skills will be well-positioned for long term success throughout their professional journeys.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job automation is massively transforming our labor force and, for better or worse, will continue to influence what the future of work looks like. From Accountants to Cashiers; Plumbers to Retailers, this </span><a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/07/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by Ilia Blinderman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the likelihood of different roles becoming automated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new wave of work has been dubbed the fourth industrial revolution, one in which our connection to the internet-of-things trumps hardware and, in many cases, human service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_10728" style="width: 961px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10728" class="wp-image-10728 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM.png" alt="snapshot of chart showing the range in which different jobs are likely to be automated from 0% to 100%" width="951" height="737" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM.png 951w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM-300x232.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-02-26-at-1.54.04-PM-768x595.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10728" class="wp-caption-text">Original image from https://pudding.cool/2017/07/jobs/ by Ilia Blinderman</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked into some of the roles Blinderman found were more likely to be automated. See how these roles have evolved and how employees can future-proof their careers to match the pace of technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bank Tellers</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking has come a long way from hand-written ledgers. Now we’re much more likely to complete transactions at ATMs or, of course, on our personal devices. It’s not uncommon to find banks without any money on site. For example, Tangerine’s Cafes provide a space for customers to speak with a financial advisor, but are not set up for regular transactions; there’s no need when everything can be done through their app. Banks like EQ don’t have a physical space at all and have really risen in the digital financial space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks are leaping into the digital space and employees will need to step up their digital know-how to stay ahead. Here’s how:</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding AI to Leverage Robo-Advisors&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve probably heard the term robo-advisors. Investment banks like Betterment are using AI to automate the investment process so that customers can take charge of their own finances, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investments made on data that may be imperceptible to humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these tools work to eliminate the need for Financial Advisors. However, they open up roles in data, development, and <a href="http://bit.ly/3cS7IXN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product management</a> – this tech, which is legitimately shaking up the financial industry, can’t program itself, and those who have the right skills will be well-positioned to advance their careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Technology to Protect Against Fraud&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud departments have also adapted to the digital era, using </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-transforming-banking-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI to analyze behavior </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to determine unusual activity. Remember when your credit card would be blocked every time you booked a flight ticket? Now banks like CIBC are able to track your spending to understand the purchases you make, even if they may not seem unusual to the human eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these tools and techniques continue to take hold, roles in <a href="http://bit.ly/2TYsPyJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> and AI will increase. There remains, after all, many opportunities for improving the banking process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Shaping FinTech with User Research and Design</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking apps have optimized user experience (UX) design to make banking more friendly and accessible. There have also been </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ux-design-is-playing-a-role-in-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented to improve clients’ financial habits. Now, without human help, we’re able to perform day-to-day banking from a user-friendly screen. For example, companies like Digit automate your savings by monitoring transactions to make an educated guess about how much you can afford to save. The Mint app allows you to easily create budgets and Clarity Money helps users keep an eye on easy-to-overlook subscriptions draining money from their accounts each month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, as the banking industry continues its digital transformation, <a href="http://bit.ly/2xsvEAB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Designers</a> will continue to have a wealth of opportunities, helping institutions understand and solve the pain points of their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bookkeepers and Accountants&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Digital_Skills-e1583941610149.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10730" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Digital_Skills-e1583941610149.jpg" alt="illustration of person on computer with charts and rapidly swiping his hand back and forth. making money online" width="700" height="241"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from the University of Oxford showed that Accountants have a 95 percent chance of seeing their jobs automated – and it makes sense. Tedious data-entry no longer requires manpower; AI has the power to create a more efficient and accurate workflow that can cost 40 percent less than current practices. Accountants and accounting firms can minimize risks to their careers and bottom lines by adapting to the new technology, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Automation to Change the Game</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software automation tools and bots are able to handle higher volumes of repeatable tasks faster and more accurately than humans, easing the workload for Accountants and Bookkeepers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple companies like ZOHO offer a free invoice creator, Highradius offers a cash application software, which offers an array of automated services that are sure to save time for Accountants. LucaNet allows you to automate data validation when comparing invoices to stock codes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CPA of Canada </span><a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/other-general-business-topics/information-management-and-technology/publications/ai-impact-on-accounting-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this new wave of tech as Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which they described as a set of automation tools that allow users to create their own bots, allowing them to handle “high-volume, low complexity, and repeatable tasks faster and with more accuracy and lower cost than humans.” RPA software can also save a company anywhere from 20 to 60 percent of full-time costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to automation tools and bots will lead to a complete overhaul of the accounting process, ultimately leaving more time for Accountants to focus on less dreary aspects of their role. This also opens up a whole new range of job opportunities in the accounting field in the areas of machine learning, <a href="http://bit.ly/2xxZMe9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI, and data science</a>, which will only increase as automation becomes more prevalent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Leveraging UX Design to Simplify Bookkeeping</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like banking, accounting accessibility increases with good UX design. With streamlined and simplified platforms, small business owners and entrepreneurs are able to manage their own bookkeeping and invoicing with tools like QuickBooks, which takes care of tracking cash flow, creating invoices, paying employees, and more all from an easy-to-use interface.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Accounting Seed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improves the accounting process by giving you an easy way to get a full view of your business’s cash flow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Mastering Data Analytics</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Accountants have always relied on data and analytics, advancements in machine learning allow professionals to anticipate future outcomes and make data-driven decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPA Canada reports that advanced analytics will enable Accountants to widen and make more decisive KPIs. “The leveraging of Big Data by advanced analytics solutions can help develop deeper understanding of new market trends, identify new KPIs for performance management, and improve accuracy and timeliness of the forecasting process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes on to say that, “There will also be a heavier emphasis on understanding data correlations and trends, which will require a solid understanding of statistical methods such as regression analysis, sample-size determination, and hypothesis testing. [&#8230;] CPAs will also&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to understand how to leverage self-serve data reporting and visualization tools such as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM Cognos BI, SAP BusinessObjects, Microsoft Power BI, and Tableau to create reports and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboards to present new insights to management.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning data analysis and gaining familiarity with tools like Tableau will open up opportunities for Accountants looking to adapt to the future of work. Data analysis courses are a quick way to upskill in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Secretaries and Administrative Assistants</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, devices are able to edit your calendar, research information, make calls, leave reminders, and more – tasks that would have once required an organized secretary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, in fact, proudly shares that Alexa is able to “simplify conference rooms, allowing meeting attendees to start meetings and control the equipment in the room by simply using their voice. Alexa can also do things around the workplace, like providing directions to a conference room, notifying IT about a broken printer, or placing an order for office supplies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Google recently launched a new feature in which a bot is able to make calls and book appointments as if from a human. With outstanding accuracy, the bot is able to call a restaurant or a hair salon to book an appointment, easily working around rescheduling obstacles and language barriers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JvbHu_bVa_g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true that very few companies have gone that route yet, it is common to be greeted by an iPad in an office lobby. Companies like Greetly offer an app that alerts meeting hosts that a guest has arrived, signs the guest in, provides a name badge, an NDA to be signed, all without a human being involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, these tools replace many of the tasks associated with administrative assistants, but they also open up opportunities for office workers to take on different administrative and operations-based responsibilities. Proactive Administrative Assistants, however, will want to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop new skills, including <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q3ghoI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design thinking</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/3cS7IXN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product management</a>, and more, to both future-proof themselves and improve the administrative field as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Customer Service Representatives</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Pay_for_my_Training-e1583941838191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10732 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Pay_for_my_Training-e1583941838191.jpg" alt="illustration of rows of people working on computers in dark blue hues. There is one person highlighted gold amongst the rows." width="700" height="241"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s getting harder and harder to tell if you’re interacting with a human when contacting customer support, and this will likely increase with time. The truth is, the majority of support inquiries are often repeated and easily answered. A chatbot can save lots of time for companies and customers alike who are looking for a quick answer to a team’s FAQ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Twitter, for example, provide minimal human aid, channeling all of their queries through their Twitter Support Account, which guides you through their FAQs and support center. While convenient, this kind of approach can backfire. Airbnb, for example, has a bad reputation for making it difficult to contact customer support. They don’t provide an email or phone number and instead weave customers through a series of support center links before making a human available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb is not alone, though, as many automated customer service systems are imperfect, creating an opportunity for organizations to differentiate themselves through superior customer service. Uber, for example, makes it quick and easy to report a problem and get a refund with just a few taps, even without human intervention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Improving the CSM Process</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, there are tons of opportunities for organizations to incorporate automation in their customer support processes, which, apart from boosting efficiency and speed, would also significantly change the role of customer service representatives. Instead of spending time doing manual research and handling routine support requests, call center employees assisted by AI could focus on more complex issues, with virtual assistants searching internal databases to find the answers they are looking for, reducing the time it would take to search multiple sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect combination will provide the right amount of convenience and personalized support. For example, Zendesk makes it easier for professionals to manage support tickets, chatbots, and more in a way that simplifies attending to customers highlighting the ways automation can be a helpful and welcome disruptor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Automation and AI Will Create Opportunities&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While large-scale changes inevitably cause anxiety, they also bring about untold opportunity for professionals and organizations willing to <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upskill</a> and reskill. Consider this: A report from McKinsey estimated that overall spending on technology will increase by more than 50 percent in the next decade, creating between 20 and 50 million high-paying jobs around the world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10717" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH.png" alt="illustration of hand shaking, they are illustrated with computer chip boards on their skin" width="700" height="241" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH.png 3331w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-300x103.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-768x265.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-1024x353.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-960x331.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-331x115.png 331w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-1160x400.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a lot of variables involved in that forecast, it illustrates the potential for automation –&nbsp;if we can really embrace it, we can create a whole new world of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Deloitte Center for the Edge wrote: “We have the potential to create significant new value for the enterprise. And paradoxically, these gains will likely come less from all the new technology than from the human workforce you already have today.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about how </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-toronto-became-a-global-tech-leader-in-7-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto became a tech leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-reasons-why-torontos-tech-industry-continues-to-soar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the sector continues to soar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the city’s growth is not limited to jobs in tech. According to the Rider Levett Bucknall Crane Index, Toronto is home to the most construction cranes in North America, with 97 currently in use. This is the second year in a row the Ontario capital has led the crane count, and what’s more astonishing is that there are another 393 proposed skyscrapers, with 10.1 million square feet of new office space in the pipeline for Toronto’s core.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Toronto – already the biggest city in Canada – is changing and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six construction projects that will have a big impact on Toronto’s tech industry.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>The Well</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread over seven and a half acres, and just down the street from BrainStation’s Toronto campus, The Well is set to make a large impact on the already tech-focused King West neighborhood. The mixed-use project, which is already under construction, includes five residential towers and two office buildings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, the development will provide:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1-million-square-feet of office space</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500,000-square-feet of retail space</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,700 condo and apartment units</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 35,000-square-foot glass canopy atop open-air walkways</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thermal energy storage facility</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40- to 60-feet wide pedestrian street corridors and walkways</span></li></ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set for completion in 2022, the project has already secured two big-name tenants: e-commerce platform Shopify, which has announced a $500 million investment to take over the project’s signature office tower at the corner of Front and Spadina; and Spaces, the Amsterdam-based co-working office company, will have over 127,158-sq-feet of office space in the project’s second office tower.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>Sidewalk Labs</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2017, Google’s sister company Sidewalk Labs announced it would develop Quayside, a 12-acre site just east of the Downtown Toronto core. Since then, the company has released a 1,524-page-long draft master plan that was both praised for its ambition and criticized for overstepping its initial boundaries (and helping to bring on a data-driven, dystopian future). In short, there is a lot that remains to be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we do know is that Sidewalk Labs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says it will spend $1.3 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the “neighborhood of the future in Toronto.” And this investment will help create 44,000 jobs, $4.3 billion in annual tax revenues, and at least $38 billion in private sector investment by 2040.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 new mixed-use buildings, including thousands of new residential units, retail and office spaces. These would be the largest collection of mass timber buildings in the world</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Canadian headquarters of Google&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to extend the city’s light-rail system&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redesigned streets that promote biking and walking</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to reduce greenhouse gases by up to 89 percent</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Wi-Fi and a number of “sensors” that will controversially collect “urban data”&nbsp;</span></li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sidewalk labs Toronto" class="wp-image-10479" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs.jpg 2667w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>East Harbour</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located on 60-acres of land east of Toronto’s downtown core (and just north of the future Sidewalk Labs site), East Harbour is a massive commercial project that aims to be both a new employment node and a secondary transportation hub for the city. The plan calls for regional transit links and a mix of office, retail, and institutional developments totaling 12-million-square-feet.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed project includes:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capacity to accommodate over 70,000 employees</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A multi-modal transit hub incorporating subway, commuter train, and light rail transit</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space for an affordable employment incubator&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30,000-square-feet of office space for a non-profit community use</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Close to nine acres of green space&nbsp;</span></li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/east-harbour.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/east-harbour-1024x569.jpg" alt="East Harbour Toronto" class="wp-image-10480" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/east-harbour-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/east-harbour-300x167.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/east-harbour-768x427.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/east-harbour-960x533.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will be the largest commercial development ever undertaken in Canada,” said John Sullivan, CEO of Cadillac Fairview, the development company now overseeing the project.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of this like Canary Wharf in London.”&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>Union Park</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, real estate giant Oxford Properties Group – the developers behind New York’s Hudson Yards –&nbsp;recently unveiled plans for a new 4.3-million-square-foot retail, office, and residential complex just north of the CN Tower.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes:&nbsp;</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.3-million-square-feet of office space across two towers&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two additional towers reserved for roughly 200,000-square-feet of retail space and 800 rental apartments</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four new mega-towers rise on the four-acre site just next to Toronto&#8217;s Metro Convention Centre (among other things)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A massive &#8220;urban park&#8221; atop the union rail corridor, which would complement the city’s own </span><a href="https://www.blogto.com/city/2020/01/toronto-getting-aerial-park-heart-downtown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rail Deck Park</span></a></li></ul>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the new housing units, The project is expected to create 22,000 construction jobs and 18,000 direct jobs upon completion.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/union-park-1-803x603.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/union-park-1-803x603.jpg" alt="Union Park Toronto" class="wp-image-10482" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/union-park-1-803x603.jpg 803w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/union-park-1-803x603-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/union-park-1-803x603-768x577.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/union-park-1-803x603-705x529.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Toronto has started construction on the 14-story&nbsp;</span>Schwartz Reisman&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation Centre.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directly across the street from the MaRS Discovery District, the Centre will house the university’s office for Entrepreneurship, Innovation, and Partnerships. It will also be the home of the Vector Institute, an independent, not-for-profit corporation dedicated to research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02-1024x682.jpg" alt="University of Toronto Innovation Centre " class="wp-image-10483" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02-960x640.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/uoft-sric-02.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vector Institute is led by Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI,” and it will strive “to attract the best global talent focused on research excellence in deep learning and machine learning.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is expected to be completed in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>CIBC Square</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIBC Square is a multi-phase commercial development across from Union Station, the city’s main transit hub, that comprises two office towers connected by a one-acre elevated park.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once completed at the end of 2020, the project’s first tower will stand 49 stories and include 1.5-million-square-feet of office space, all of which have already been pre-leased. Microsoft is among the building’s first tenants, and the tech giant will occupy 132,000 square feet over four floors.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the competition to discover and lure top tech talent heats up, some of the world’s top tech companies have found great success by rethinking a longtime requirement in their search for skilled workers: the college degree.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/degree-problem-you-can-still-land-jobs-top-companies-joseph-milord/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a number of leading companies have ditched their requirements for a four-year college degree, including Google, Apple, IBM, Nordstrom, Costco and Bank of America. That’s in line with recommendations from experts like those at the Harvard Business Review, which declared in 2017 that “competency is more important than credentials” and warned of how degree requirements could threaten the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, a bachelor’s degree is no longer a barrier for entry to work at the world’s top companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world, those are exceptional human beings,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google’s former senior vice-president of people operations, Laszlo Bock. “And we should do everything we can to find those people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why has there been such a dramatic shift in educational expectations? Here are some of the reasons tech workers no longer need a college degree to thrive in their field. </span></p>
<h2><b>It’s All About Skills</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an influential 2016 letter to U.S. President Donald Trump, IBM President and CEO Ginni Rometty described the rise of “new collar” jobs and the shifting skills requirements to excel in those positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, IBM’s vice-president of talent Joanna Daley told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/why-ibm-wants-to-hire-employees-who-dont-have-a-4-year-college-degree.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC Make It</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that about 15 percent of her company’s U.S. hires don’t have a four-year degree and that the tech company now looks at candidates who have hands-on experience through bootcamps or industry-related vocational classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Getting a job at today’s IBM does not always require a college degree; at some of our centers in the United States, as many as one-third of employees have less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes obtained through vocational training,” Rometty </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition, we are creating and hiring to fill ‘new collar’ jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, and cognitive business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelling in positions such as those often requires highly specialized training that is in line with the absolute latest industry trends, which isn’t necessarily a strength of large colleges with rigid four-year curriculums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, HackerRank’s annual survey of student developers attending college found that only 32 percent reported learning to code in school, with 27 percent saying they were self-taught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More businesses should overhaul their outdated practices and stop pretending that when it comes to the skills they need in employees, there’s any correlation between a degree from one of the nation’s elite schools and high performance,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/college-degree-requirements-upwork/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains why a LinkedIn study found that companies including Apple, Oracle, and Google often ask either for a degree or “equivalent practical experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The four-year degree isn’t gone altogether but we’re starting to see a shift in what these companies are looking for,” </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-dont-need-a-4-year-college-degree-for-these-high-paying-jobs-at-google-apple-netflix-2019-04-08"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Laura Lorenzetti, editor at LinkedIn. “There’s a growing emphasis on skills over school as they compete for top talent. People still see the four-year degree as a signaling factor but companies are taking experience as seriously as a four-year degree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>A Tech Talent Shortage Has Employers Rethinking Their Priorities</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you have surely heard about the industry-wide– and ever-growing – </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/canadas-tech-talent-gap-increasing-the-value-of-digital-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for tech talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that there are simply not enough skilled workers to meet it. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is forecasting the employment of computer and information technology professionals to grow by 13 percent by 2026 – faster than the average for all occupations. Meanwhile, a recent report from G2 Crowd found that 80.8 percent of employers reported that it’s more difficult to fill positions now compared to 2015, while 51 percent said that the difficulty owed to a lack of talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM has felt that crunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got a massive skills gap across the tech industry, so people with non-traditional backgrounds are really becoming valuable,” </span><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-you-dont-need-a-4year-degree-to-get-the-tech-job-of-your-dreams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kelli Jordan, talent leader for IBM’s New Collar Initiatives program. “You don’t need to go get a computer science degree to be a web developer. You can learn those languages in a variety of ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, a phenomenon called “degree inflation” led to many companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for jobs that had traditionally been filled by workers who didn’t have one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2014 report from Burning Glass Technologies looked at the scope of degree inflation by comparing the number of people in a certain occupation who have a degree to the number of job postings requiring one. The report found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs, 21 percent for computer and math jobs, and 13 percent for sales jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a glaring shortage of talent in tech, it would be self-defeating for companies to exclude so many skilled workers because they don’t have a credential that might not even be relevant to their job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For decades, at many companies that I worked for, I wasn’t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four-year degree,” </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/need-college-degree-get-job-these-companies-say-skills-matter-n1001526"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trish Torizzo, chief information officer for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which recently dropped its degree requirement for applicants.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Now) supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It Creates a More Inclusive Environment</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ottawa-based eCommerce giant Shopify has never demanded a college degree in its job postings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t require any background or a specific amount of experience in any specific field. Instead, we want someone who can make an impact,” </span><a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/work/want-a-job-in-canadian-tech-dont-worry-about-that-university-degree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shopify’s director of talent acquisition Anna Lambert, who noted that after seven years – and 3,000 hires! – she has seen a major shift in the industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s less focus on experience and more on your ability to do the job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Lambert’s recruitment team includes someone who used to be a welder – a background she says is “very different, but somehow totally applicable.” She suggests that instead of asking prospective employees for a specific experience and deciding they aren’t qualified, try to make all people feel welcome and consider where their strengths might lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A more inclusive job posting will show that you know experience comes in all forms – and you want that,” Lambert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a more open-minded approach to educational requirements could also help to reverse the tide of an ongoing crisis in tech: a lack of diversity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges in the U.S. and around the world continue to struggle with </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/can-people-like-me-go-to-college-inequality-and-dreams-of-higher-ed-73893"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequality and a lack of diversity among their student populations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That mainly owes to economics; while </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cpa.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">83 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of students from high-income families in the U.S. enroll in college, only 63 percent from low- and middle-income families do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of what motivated Upwork to drop their degree requirements for new hires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly, four-year universities produce too few graduating classes that are reflective of the country’s racial, social, and economic diversity,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/college-degree-requirements-upwork/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel. “Because of their soaring fees, colleges are pricing themselves out of reach for many Americans. As a result, businesses are in danger of being walled off from huge sections of America’s talented pool.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who may be shunted to the margins of the labor market won’t be disqualified for lack of intelligence or skill, but because they simply can’t afford to pay for school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a 2017 research project from the Harvard Business School determined that employers “appear to be closing off their access to the two-thirds of the U.S. workforce that does not have a four-year college degree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is only getting worse as college becomes more out-of-reach for many Americans; average annual tuition costs at four-year universities more than doubled between the 1985-86 and 2015-16 academic years, from $12,052 to $26,120 after adjusting to inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If education becomes unaffordable for most and companies continue to require college degrees, we’ll perpetuate a system by which those companies will only hire from a relatively small and privileged group of graduates,” Kasriel said. “That makes no business sense for a country that’s already suffering from a painful lack of know-how in many crucial tech sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also isn’t fitting for a country known as the land of opportunity.”</span></p>
<h2><b>A Lack of Value</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both employers and workers alike are complaining that the four-year college degree isn’t necessarily bringing an adequate return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve covered the high costs of a college education already, and the results aren’t necessarily always there. According to the 2018 Freelancing in America survey, 93 percent of freelancers with a four-year college degree said skills training was useful for the work they currently did, compared to only 79 percent who said their college education was useful.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 DigitalOcean survey found that bootcamp grads heading into a software engineering position felt “much better prepared for the real world” than four-year college grads, by a margin of 61 percent to 36 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that perceived lack of value goes both ways. From an employer’s perspective, Harvard’s report found that degree-holders command an 11-to-30 percent wage premium, but fail to justify that premium in productivity or other outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the report found that college graduates filling these positions “are costing companies more money to employ, tend to be less engaged in their jobs, have a higher turnover rate, and reach productivity levels only on par with high school graduates doing the same job.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It Can Improve the Lives of Their Workers</b><b><br />
</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there are plenty of great reasons to pursue a college education. But getting a degree only because it seems like a prerequisite to finding a job isn’t one, and crushing student debt is taking a huge toll on the American workforce.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 44.2 million Americans are now carrying student loan debt, and those Americans owe more than $1.48 trillion collectively – roughly $620 billion more than total U.S. credit card debt. Research from Citizens Financial Group showed that 60 percent of student debt borrowers can expect to pay off their loans in their 40s, while another </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8LurBVUNQZfQVhYZWZvamlfd00/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that Wisconsin university graduates take on average 19.7 years to pay off a bachelor’s degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While tech companies compete to offer their employees the best packages of benefits and perks, there’s certainly something to be said for a workforce who aren’t buried under a pile of debt.</span></p>
<h2><b>Follow the Leader</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry trends often start at the top, and when it comes to loosening or dropping degree demands – to put it simply – all the biggest companies seem to be doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, a recent LinkedIn study showed that many of the companies listed among its 2019 LinkedIn Top Companies in the U.S. no longer require a degree, including Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Netflix, Airbnb, Facebook, Oracle, Dell, and, of course, Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that about half of Apple’s U.S. employment in 2018 was made up of people who didn’t have a four-year degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stressed instead the need for certain in-demand skills; in Apple’s case, that skill is coding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we’ve looked at the…mismatch between the skills that are coming out of colleges and what the skills are that we believe we need in the future, and many other businesses do, we’ve identified coding as a very key one,” he </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-why-college-degree-isnt-necessary-2019-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainly makes sense given that Apple’s Steve Jobs famously founded the company after dropping out of college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company, as you know, was founded by a college drop-out,” Cook </span><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftop-companies-are-hiring-more-candidates-without-a-4-year-degree-2019-4&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fdegree-problem-you-can-still-land-jobs-top-companies-joseph-milord%2F&amp;xguid=67b5964b3e61ef97c1d7513af1846f14&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=30439db150c9a1425c3c997e96b18423"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “So we’ve never really thought that a college degree was the thing that you had to do well. We’ve always tried to expand our horizons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Jobs wasn’t the only tech trailblazer who didn’t hold a degree. The same could be said of Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Dell’s Michael Dell, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, and Whatsapp’s Jan Koum.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to a mix of homegrown tech startup companies and expanding offices from established giants like Amazon and Google, urban centers from Vancouver to New York to Toronto are witnessing a boom in employment opportunities — and with it, highly skilled tech workers moving on in. But will all those workers actually stick around long-term?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One survey suggests — maybe not. A whopping three out of every four employees in the tech sector would consider moving to a new city for work, </span><a href="https://thehustle.co/tech-workers-relocate-remote-work-cost-of-living/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Axios research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And when workers are figuring out where to live, more than 80 percent say the cost of living is the top factor, followed by weather, commute times, and affordable housing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many desirable candidates open to moving around, cities across North America should be bracing for a tech-xodus of sorts, given the high possibility of workers looking for more affordable places to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, companies need to be extra cautious about keeping their top hires happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a big part of the attraction from an employee perspective is, am I working in a job that&#8217;s all the things I&#8217;m looking for?” says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sean Mullin, Executive Director of the </span><a href="https://brookfieldinstitute.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Ryerson University in Toronto.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Good pay, it&#8217;s compelling, it&#8217;s interesting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a high demand for tech skills, he adds, and many jobs in the industry — be it web development or graphic design or social media management — can be done remotely more often than other industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of the reason tech workers are easier to pull away, but it’s something companies and cities can combat through a variety of channels.</span></p>
<h2><b>Focus on Culture and Retraining&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the ways companies can boost employee retention is by focusing on improving overall corporate culture, which can mean increasing salaries and providing benefits like on-site childcare, catered meals, and social events.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to pay them more, give them better working environments&#8230; that creates a more vibrant environment and helps retain them,” Mullin says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we&#8217;ve recently written about, <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retraining, or reskilling, is an increasingly important tool for organizations,</a> and it too can have a huge impact on culture and employee retention.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a</span><a href="https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-value-of-employee-training-and-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2017 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 70 percent of employees said that job-related training and development opportunities influenced their decision to stay at their job.&nbsp; As little as a 10 percent increase in educational development has also been shown to lead to an </span><a href="https://www.businessknowhow.com/manage/higherprod.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8.6 percent gain in productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>Ensure Cities Are Worth Living In</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments, he adds, can also play a role in fostering the type of community skilled workers want to call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A place like Toronto and other cities like New York, the tech component of our economies is growing quite rapidly, and high-quality companies — like start-ups or scale-ups or even large companies — setting up shop&#8230; bodes well,” Mullin says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if those cities aren’t livable, quality hires can get restless and disenchanted. So, he says, civic leaders need to regularly ask a key question: Are they making their city a good place to live?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Public transit, affordability&#8230; if those things aren&#8217;t there, it doesn&#8217;t matter how good the job is,” Mullin warns. “You&#8217;ll start to lose people to places where they can get the work they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For employers, it can be worth lobbying their local government as well, to ensure decision-makers get the memo that livable cities attract top talent — which in turn boosts the economy and attracts more talent and investment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, a win-win.</span></p>
<h2><b>Adapt to a More “Fluid” Labor Market</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullin says while companies and cities need to be aware of worker preferences, and the likelihood of team members jumping ship, there’s also no cause for alarm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You might have a phenomenon where there is a shift of people out of cities, or out of big cities and into smaller cities, but the net effect is you still have people pouring into the tech sector,” he says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would take a huge, sudden shift to suddenly have the outflow increase to such an extent that it starts to have these numbers decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line? It’s natural and healthy for people to move in and out of cities, and it’s all part of a “fluid” labor market, Mullin says.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, whether companies like it or not, having workers willing to move is a good way to keep employers on their toes — so they’re always giving top hires a reason to stay.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-prepare-for-the-future-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preparing for the future of work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/future-proof-your-workforce-by-tapping-its-adaptability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">future-proofing your workforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but we haven’t answered a fundamental question: what do we mean when we talk about the “future of work?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at a number of factors that have turned this into an important topic of discussion. First: </span></p>
<h2><b>The Definition of Work is Changing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officially, the definition of work is “to perform work or fulfill duties regularly for wages or salary.” This has been the appropriate definition since the industrial age at least, where the notion of work has become increasingly transactional and routine: organizations provide jobs and people specialize in certain tasks. These tasks tend to get even more specialized with time, which helps create more reliable products and services (and more reliable product margins). The more something can be standardized, however, the more susceptible it is to technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of which brings us to the future, and more specifically, the reason why everyone seems to be talking about the future of work. With technological innovations increasing at an astounding pace, there is a sense that we are moving towards a world where work is less transactional in nature, and more about experiences and doing something with a sense of purpose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Author </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie Wade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has written, “work is morphing from a place into an activity,” with less rigidity in structure, changing office dynamics, and blurring time boundaries spurred on by always-on connectivity. Millennials, she argues, are “unfettered by the legacy habits, perceptions and ingrained, accepted norms that limit earlier groups and generations.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And much of that is being fueled by the fact that: </span></p>
<h2><b>The Way We Work is Changing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate of adoption for new technology has never been faster. The telephone, for example, needed 75 years before it had 50 million users. Facebook hit that milestone in under four years and even that seems quaint given the speed at which apps can explode into our collective use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workplace has not been immune to a quicker pace of change. Consider, for example, the rapid rise of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Remote work<br />
</b>“Working from home” and “telecommuting” options were not available to most people’s parents.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>“Digital nomads”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology and shifting perspectives on career development have made the idea of freelancing from anywhere in the world much more attractive and attainable over the last decade.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>“The gig economy”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of Uber is just one example of the “sharing economy” employment model that has allowed people to supplement their incomes with part-time work. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>The Way We Work With Employees is Changing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, the traditional employee-employer relationship has changed. Apart from the aforementioned differences in the way employees are completing their work, organizations are now expected to operate in a much more transparent manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like Mattermark and Buffer, for example, have generated press coverage by sharing information on employee compensation and financial performance, despite the fact that they are not required to. In Buffer’s case, the decision to share this information led to a dramatic increase in job applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It kind of feels like this is somewhat of a movement bubbling up here. That’s kind of surprising,” CEO and Co-Founder Joel Gascoigne told Quartz, explaining that it also improved the quality of talent the company was attracting. “The percent of people who were a good culture fit was a lot higher,” he said, adding that while sharing salary information might scare some people away, “it scares the right people away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These companies are tapping into a cultural shift, where younger employees are increasingly attracted by jobs – and forward-thinking companies – that have a purpose. In fact, according to an Intelligence Group study from 2014, 64 percent of Millennials would rather make $40,000 a year at a job they love than $100,000 a year at a job they think is boring. In addition, 71 percent of professionals said they&#8217;d be willing to take a pay cut if it meant they could work at a place that had a mission they believed in and a clear system of values congruent with their own.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing this, companies have had to put an emphasis on employee engagement, with increased training opportunities leading the charge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’re written about, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-fight-employee-turnover-skills-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">training can break employees out of daily routines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving them the kind of new experiences that increase loyalty and commitment. “New experiences don’t always have to come with promotions or vertical projects,” Eileen Chadnick, Principal at Big Cheese Coaching told us. “It can be gaining exposure to a new skill or new software.”</span></p>
<h2><b>We Are in the Age of Big Data </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2009, Hal Varian, Google’s Chief Economist predicted that “the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians.” Exactly ten years later, Data Scientist roles have increased by 650 percent, with the number of available data jobs in the US increasing by 364,000 to 2.7 million. Fueling this demand is the fact that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every single day&#8230;and this is only increasing. In fact, 90 percent of the data in the world was generated in the last two years alone! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a study by Dresner Advisory Services, data science adoption in enterprises increased from 17 percent in 2015 to 59 percent in 2018. Expect this number to continue to increase as companies and industries get a better handle on how to leverage this deluge of information. Already, data has had a dramatic impact on everything from </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-big-data-has-transformed-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sports </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(including the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-data-played-a-role-in-the-toronto-raptors-nba-championship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raptor’s NBA championship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/using-data-to-drive-community-at-lululemon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">community building</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and efforts to spearhead </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-organizations-are-using-data-for-social-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">societal change.</span></a></p>
<h2><b>Digital Transformation Is Real </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey, 74 percent of executives said their organization was actively involved in digital transformation activities, with an additional 63 percent claiming that their digital investments were growing. To understand the impact of these initiatives, consider that 89 percent claim there are elements of their products and services that did not exist five years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, digital transformation is happening, and clearly, it’s important, but you’d be forgiven for not exactly knowing what it refers to. The term, after all, has been so broadly used that it can refer to a number of things, including the integration of technology (like the aforementioned use of data) and making significant cultural changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agile Elephant defined it this way: “[Digital transformation] involves a change in leadership, different thinking, the encouragement of innovation and new business models, incorporating digitization of assets and an increased use of technology to improve the experience of your organisation’s employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and stakeholders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Altimeter Group, companies undergoing a digital transformation enjoy increased market share and customer engagement, higher employee morale, and increased customer revenue. There are, however, a number of challenges associated with this kind of endeavor. In a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey sponsored by Jabil</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the top five were: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee pushback</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of digital expertise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rigid organizational structure</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of digital strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited budget</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the pushback from employees is being driven by uncertainty caused by the fact that:</span></p>
<h2><b>The Robots Are Coming</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now you might have heard: automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are going to be playing a bigger role in our daily lives. In fact, we’ve already outlined how </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-can-help-diagnose-and-treat-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI can help diagnose and treat mental illness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-being-used-to-make-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create art</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-transforming-banking-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform banking and finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on your point of view, these articles are incredibly exciting or utterly terrifying, and both feelings are perfectly valid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimates differ on the exact impact automation will have, but it’s safe to say that a number of jobs are at risk. In fact, researchers at Oxford University found that 47 percent of U.S. workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years. A McKinsey report, meanwhile, predicted that “up to 375 million workers, or 14 percent of the global workforce, may need to change occupations — and virtually all workers may need to adapt to work alongside machines in new ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These kinds of estimates are causing considerable anxiety among employees. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center survey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 72 percent of Americans are concerned about robots and computers taking jobs, despite the fact that just 2 percent report having actually lost a job to automation. Underpinning that anxiety (as misplaced as it may be), is a real opportunity. As the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte Center for the Edge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writes in a new report: “That opportunity is to return to the most basic question of all: What is work? If we come up with a creative answer to that, we have the potential to create significant new value for the enterprise. And paradoxically, these gains will likely come less from all the new technology than from the human workforce you already have today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, the report encourages companies to embrace automation to the fullest, with the goal of freeing up and developing new forms of work, which will create more value for workers and organizations. The goal has to be to use technology to solve problems and – like humanity has done throughout history – turn innovation into new opportunities and progress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the same McKinsey report estimated that overall spending on technology will increase by more than 50 percent in the next decade, creating between 20 and 50 million high-paying jobs globally.</span></p>
<h2><strong>So, What’s Really in Store For the Future of Work?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, the pace of change can be concerning, which leads to alarmist discussions about the “future of work.” But we’ve seen how much workplaces have changed over the last 100 (and even 20) years, and despite these drastic shifts, we are still here. So, while you might read about (and fear) a dystopian future run by blood-thirsty robots, it’s far more likely that technological innovation and adoption will bring about a whole new realm of opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trick is making sure you’re prepared for it. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, there’s been an ongoing shift toward flexible work options at companies large and small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does that mean exactly? In modern workplaces, it’s a broad spectrum of options that allow employees more freedom and creativity to figure out how, when, and where they work best — well beyond the traditional 9-to-5 office mentality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could mean flexible hours, remote work, unlimited vacation time, or even scrapping a traditional workplace in favor of a target-based system where your team works however they want, as long as they hit their deadlines and get the job done well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However companies make it work, one thing is clear: Flexible work options can be a great way to attract and retain skilled workers while keeping them happy in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some reasons why companies should now be offering flexible work options. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Helps Recruit Top Talent</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As flexible work becomes more common, there’s a growing expectation for it — among both young professionals and top-tier hires who’ve grown frustrated by antiquated and restrictive workplace demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2019 study by flex workplace provider IWG, for instance, found a whopping 85 percent of Canadian professionals would turn down a job that didn&#8217;t offer flexible working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having a company that&#8217;s nimble enough to change with the times has never been more important,” according to Wayne Berger, CEO, IWG Canada, and Latin America. “For companies serious about winning the war for talent, offering flexible arrangements is now the norm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When companies offer more flex options, “it&#8217;s definitely a lot easier to get talent that has a few more years of experience,” echoes ZJ Hadley, the Senior People Consultant for Bright + Early, a human resources consultancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A start-up company trying to attract a senior-level staffer, for instance, would be well-served offering perks like flexible office hours to make a role — and perhaps a lower paycheck — more appealing to someone with a family and desire for work-life balance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flex Work Strengthens Worker Loyalty</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve got solid staff members in the door, flexible work options can also help retain them — because who wants to leave those kinds of perks?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, an American survey from the Society for Human Resource Management found companies that launched flexible work plans reported an 89 percent retention increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can help you build loyalty with your employees &#8230; if you treat them with respect, invest in them and trust them, they&#8217;ll bring the same thing back,” Hadley says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all about meeting people where they are and appreciating what they bring to the table, she adds, which could mean allowing a new parent to shift into part-time work or offering all employees the option to work remotely a few days each week.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Can Boost Productivity</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers often fear their employees will abuse flexible work policies and grow unproductive as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sure, while that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen, it’s easy to avoid by setting clear targets for your staff, having regular check-ins, and ensuring your whole team is communicating even if some members work different hours or off-site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, when flex work is implemented smartly, what’s more likely to happen is actually a boost in productivity, research has shown.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adigaskell/2016/01/15/why-a-flexible-worker-is-a-happy-and-productive-worker/#67514c0314c4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which took place over a nine-month period, found flexible workers were a lot more productive than their peers working a traditional 9-to-5 schedule in multiple areas — they achieved more, were off sick less often, and were happier in their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s good news is that, because employees who think they have a positive work-life balance are more productive and dedicated by 21 percent than those who don&#8217;t think so, according to a survey of 50,000 employees worldwide, writes </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2017/08/29/how-positive-employee-morale-benefits-your-business/#33fd3f872549"><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Craig for Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flex Work Helps Reduce Worker Burnout</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity is one thing, but sometimes your staff can work themselves too hard. And whether it’s the stress of commuting or the frustration of spending most daylight hours in a cubicle, there are plenty of reasons why employees can start to feel burnt out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexible work options, when coupled with other workplace supports, can help reduce the issues that often come with the daily grind, experts say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employees find that being in control of their time reduces the stress and helps them in delivering their job duties efficiently,” writes </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315325"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suhail Al-Masri for Entrepreneur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line, Hadley says, is that flexible work options ensure people feel valued — giving employees a better sense of work-life balance that keeps them happy, thriving, and productive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re definitely seeing a shift in the workforce where people want to feel like they&#8217;re doing something meaningful with their lives,” she says.</span></p>
