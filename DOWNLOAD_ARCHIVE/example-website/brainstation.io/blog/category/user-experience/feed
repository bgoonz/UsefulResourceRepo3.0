								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite earning a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Matthew Mayers knew he wanted to be in the tech industry. So after a few years of side-hustles and working as an Engineer, he applied for the UX Design Diploma Program BrainStation.</p>



<p>We spoke with Mayers about his foray into tech, how the BrainStation experience bolstered his entrepreneurial spirit, and what it’s like to be a Co-Founder of <a href="http://rallylegal.com">Rally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QBmeKrma43aIW_iTtUtPkkL_2NvVDnz3yNw6dJSMvRR8VSFIWeRpBrZbOdySXc31vLk26x22C0AC6RglTFMYzulWoRzDD6qFEOwTxd6JVrTn97sjsEQvDctRCYlFz_m0O4drLV99" alt="Picture of founder, Matthew Mayers."/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>What does a typical day look like for you as a Co-Founder of Rally?</strong></h2>



<p>Every day is different and that&#8217;s why I love my job. As a Co-Founder, my responsibilities range from product design, to customer success, to accounting, to recruitment, to development. Some days are filled with meetings, others are quiet and focused. I start every day by asking myself, &#8220;What set of actions can I take today to add the most value for my company and team?&#8221; Sometimes that means weighing in on a high-stakes product discussion, other times it means running to the post office to buy stamps.</p>



<h2><strong>How did the idea for Rally first come about? What problem does it aim to solve?</strong></h2>



<p>Shortly after completing my <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">program at BrainStation</a>, I was approached by my co-founder Daniel Di Maria (a fellow BrainStation graduate) with an idea. Based on his previous experience as a lawyer, he believed that there were many opportunities to drive improvement within the legal industry. He envisioned a world in which entrepreneurs could affordably manage the legal state of their companies in a streamlined, digital fashion. Automation could be used to help their lawyers and paralegals get work done faster, more accurately, and more enjoyably.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/v40S_ioFWgO9MZfphotq3mkZEChMuDDdwVB3iUJm3JfVTap6D1JSD0pUJGYIsmPW56cl8DqIlYjXdrh8wx8HtcfA-F8Ze9xbP_X36-7gpcfWsIYOn9X89MqQxBdP5wQhuU0wegmN" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<p>Having already experienced my first shot at entrepreneurship, the idea immediately resonated as I had struggled to find affordable legal services. I ended up doing much of my legal work myself and incorrectly.</p>



<p>We soon met our other Co-Founder, Scott Stevenson, who was serendipitously developing a similar concept. Now, three years in, our ideas have grown and evolved but we still aim to solve the same problems – legal services remain too expensive, inefficient, and inaccessible.</p>



<h2><strong>What has been the response you’ve received for Rally?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Legal service providers are feeling a tremendous amount of pressure (especially in a post-COVID world) to adopt technology which enables legal work to be done better and more affordably. Purchasers of legal services are fed up with the antiquated ways of operating and are pleading with their providers to catch up with the modern, digital world. <br><br>More and more forward-thinking service providers are approaching us with a desire to provide a better client-experience and it&#8217;s highly rewarding to be equipping these drivers of positive change. We sincerely believe that this is just the beginning for the legal industry. Massive transformations will be demonstrated in the coming years and we look forward to doing our small part to help.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hrqDeEeVqEgSaOI6czqkfTA0vT6wrdnyghoE3T8btZmHsxK5sLvPc5t36R8rcbxn5a9UHm-W6hPxVcBpIl2aE9H8zq01bOCIgY6iir2AuBSqMxU0ZLs-zrrG0HeEdeOpidvgSLIO" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<h2><strong>What made you decide to apply to the User Experience Diploma Program?</strong></h2>



<p>I have always been deeply fascinated by the intersection of human behavior and technology. User experience design is so much more than the selection of fonts and colours. Digital design has the power to alter how people see themselves, interact with each other, and engage with the world around them. Through BrainStation, I aimed to achieve a deeper understanding of how to harness this power. I wanted to develop both my creativity and technical acumen to improve people&#8217;s lives through innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How did the skills you learned at BrainStation contribute to how you designed your product?</strong></h2>



<p>At BrainStation, I learned how to take a step back and ask the right questions before starting to build. Who are we building for? What are their biggest pain-points? Where are the greatest opportunities to improve people&#8217;s workflows? What do they want, not just from products but from their lives? What do they need?</p>



<p>We spent several months speaking with potential customers, asking these questions and iterating on mockups before writing a single line of code. We have since developed a design-first culture and answering the &#8216;why&#8217; always comes before the &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;how.&#8217; We&#8217;re proud that even our talented development team is involved in the process from the very early stages of design to help ensure we&#8217;re building the right tools for our customers.</p>



<h2><strong>What challenges have you faced in creating a seamless user experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most challenging aspects of designing Rally is accounting for multiple, distinct user types, each with their own unique goals and behavior. While our customers are legal service providers, they use Rally as their client-facing interface. It&#8217;s a two-sided product – similar to a marketplace with buyers and sellers. Accommodating the various “jobs-to-be-done” of each persona while providing a frictionless, unified experience necessitates working relentlessly with our customers and their clients to continuously gather insights. <br><br>Every Designer learns about the value of customer feedback but sorting, filtering, and prioritizing insights is a highly nuanced and ever-evolving process.</p>



<h2><strong>What was a highlight of your BrainStation learning experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While learning the core executional skills of UX Design was one of the best educational experiences of my life, I particularly enjoyed the group discussions focused on the philosophy and ethics of design. Thanks to my instructors, Alex Chong and Brad MacDonald, there were many opportunities to dive into the rich, existential questions of what it means to design. These conversations forever changed my understanding of how the application of science through technology impacts humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_U60H4P8p6Y9Gj-CfoFxbMwMtfUoutUUXwzI27cjaNDTHGqEtWzhbH8A1ufmZR8vDTtTH6qZkdKbZ-XVImw4SawX6-yqJ5EcnjHEuIC-8NMEhmoS23FBchrCFLGNquQNrMgiLvha" alt="Group of young students gathered around a computer in class."/></figure>



<h2><strong>You hired Tiffany Chan, a fellow BrainStation graduate. How did you connect?</strong></h2>



<p>We did! We recently had the opportunity to recruit for an entry-level position and couldn&#8217;t think of a better place to look than the bootcamp ecosystem. We got in touch with Michael Bennett, BrainStation&#8217;s Career Success Manager, who connected us with Tiffany. With her experience both as a student in the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development program</a> and then as a TA, she was able to hit the ground running at Rally from her first day. Our team is now almost half BrainStation graduates!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What would you say are some essential digital skills needed to succeed in business?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The single most essential digital skill I would suggest for anyone in the tech industry is developing a foundational understanding of how code works. You don&#8217;t need to become a certified Software Engineer or even gain true proficiency – but you will have a massive advantage knowing a bit about what&#8217;s under the hood to confidently assess feasibility and effort requirements for new functionality. This applies to Designers, Marketers, Product Managers – everyone. Learning the basics of code has made me a much more effective team member even though most of my job doesn&#8217;t require any coding at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What advice would you give to aspiring UX Designers?</strong></h2>



<p>Designing for an idealistic world with rigid processes will only get you so far. In the real world there are technological constraints, market sizing concerns, budgets, and timelines that all need to be considered. Learning to understand everyone else&#8217;s role within a team (such as marketing, finance, development, etc.) and their requirements is as important as designing for the end-user. This is how you move beyond pipe dreams and toward product designs that actually get built and used in real life. By gaining a sense of the big picture and approaching your process with an appropriate level of flexibility, you will find yourself integrating business and technical requirements into your designs at earlier stages.&nbsp;<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This month, current BrainStation students had the opportunity to participate in a Design Sprint, in partnership with IBM.</p>



<p>Each team had five days to design a solution for an identified problem inspired by one of three sample user personas. IBM&#8217;s Senior Design Lead David Burdreau and Senior UX Designer Dan Silveira judged the event, and were impressed by what they saw from the student teams. “You guys are blowing me away… it’s absolutely incredible what you can accomplish in five days. It makes me think that we at IBM should do more in five-day sprints,” Burdreau said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-1024x536.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12228" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-300x157.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-768x402.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-1536x804.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-2048x1072.jpg 2048w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners-960x502.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25130753/IBM-UX-Design-Sprint-Winners.jpg 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We spoke with the winning team: Hope Liang, Jose-Carlos (Joey) Laguio, Matthew Ahn, Nina Paramonov, Rachel Fuhrer, and Renee Yang. Together, these students designed Task Circle, a remote collaboration app to help improve inclusive interactions between international students and their project teammates.</p>



<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>Currently enrolled in the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">full-time User Experience Design bootcamp</a> at BrainStation, the students were eager to put their learnings to the test and work with a larger team of Designers with a panel from a design thinking pioneer like IBM.</p>



<p>“The main benefit of participating in the design sprint was having the opportunity to work within a larger group of Designers. In class, we typically worked with around two or three other Designers at a time, but in this case, we had the opportunity of working within a team of six,” said Laguio.</p>



<p>“It was an opportunity to solve big problems in a very short amount of time. It challenged me and gave me a chance to think deeply about important issues,” said Fuhrer.</p>



<p>For their winning project, the team was inspired by the pivot many post-secondary students have had to make while pursuing remote education from all over the world.</p>



<p>“We came up with Task Circle, a digital solution to address the online learning and student collaboration that was designed with international students in mind. We wanted to create something that allowed students to feel valued and included by their peers in order for them to effectively contribute to projects,” said Yang.</p>



<p>Task Circle:</p>



<ol><li>Allows students to communicate and empathize with their classmates</li><li>Tracks project progress, successes, and challenges</li><li>Supports inclusion by creating space for international students to reach out for help</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-1024x336.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12250" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-1024x336.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-300x98.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-768x252.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-1536x504.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-960x315.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Working Together While Apart</h2>



<p>While trying to solve remote collaboration for other students, the team first had to figure out how they were going to master it for themselves.</p>



<p>“One of the reasons why I think our group worked so well together was because every single one of us did a fantastic job of accommodating each others’ schedules,” said Laguio. With students collaborating from around the world, time zones were another factor to consider in their design process.</p>



<p>Paramonov credits the outstanding professionalism of her teammates for their success. “It was a mix of very humble, curious and hardworking people. All of us put the team interest before personal interests. All decision-making we made together based on logic, time frame and learned material.”</p>



<p>But the design sprint wasn’t without challenges.</p>



<p>Delivering a high-fidelity prototype in just five days to be presented to design leaders from IBM is no small feat.</p>



<p>“We were posed with a daunting challenge and it was difficult figuring out how to get started. We had lots of questions, confusion about what to focus on and lots of uncertainty in general. I learned that getting started, making assumptions, and asking questions is the hardest, but most important part,” said Fuhrer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking">Design thinking</a> requires conducting user research to test assumptions and learn more about user needs. When the team’s initial assumptions and hypothesis didn’t align with what they uncovered through their research, they had to reevaluate their project’s purpose.</p>



<p>“It was a chance for us to pivot from our original idea, we had to kind of let go of our attachment to previous plans, but we all had an understanding that we needed to focus on what would bring the best solution,” said Yang.</p>



<p>Communication around what would bring the best solution and keep the project moving forward also proved to be a bit of a challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much like design teams in the workplace, communication proved to be essential. As the team of six ideated, different opinions and visions emerged, but this did not stall the project&#8217;s progress.</p>



<p>“Even if we didn’t fully agree, it didn’t mean the conversation had to stop,” said Laguio. “We created a space where it was okay to respectfully challenge others’ ideas, and where it was even better to riff off of them to spur even more creative ideas.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-1024x591.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12252" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-1024x591.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-300x173.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-768x443.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-1536x887.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-960x554.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When presentation day arrived, Liang recalls the excitement her team felt as they prepared. “All team members were helping each other to practice their speech, time the parts, adjust the [slide] deck, and do whatever it takes to make the final pitch flawless.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s always a desire to push further and if you had more time you feel as if you could do more, do better. It’s important to manage expectations,” notes Ahn.“It was satisfying to see our presentation come together. To see all of our hard work come together in the end, we felt proud of each other.”</p>



<h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>



<p>Fuhrer credits BrainStation’s extensive curriculum with her ability to tackle the sprint, “The 12-week bootcamp is taught by passionate educators that come from different industry backgrounds and experiences. They have taught me so much&#8230; design concepts, skills, career guidance, and I’ve been supported from day one to fully launch myself into a UX career,” she said, adding that the program also gave her hands-on experience with essential design tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I went from never touching design software prior to BrainStation, to presenting our project in week seven with ease and confidence,”&nbsp; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team encourages those considering a career change to take their first step into the unknown. “Embrace ambiguity. Accept that you might not know where that next step might take you, and that this is okay.” said Laguio. “I took the leap and threw myself into [BrainStation’s] intensive UX Design bootcamp. And now, it’s really surreal thinking about how we’ve just won our first design sprint with IBM and comparing that to the fear-filled me from a few months ago!”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>Designing Great Experiences in a Digital-First World </strong>panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on July 9th, and professionals around the world tuned in to discuss the way brands have adjusted their design strategies in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/436946085" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>The pace of digitization has sped up over the last few months, forcing entire industries to adopt new digital strategies. How have the world’s best brands, Designers, and digital product owners adjusted to an increasingly online-only world?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few ways leading brands are designing great experiences in a digital-first world.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Embrace Design Thinking </strong></h3>



<p>Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, some of the largest organizations in the United States saw the potential design had to spur innovation and drive growth. Capital One, for example, acquired Adaptive Path, a San Francisco-based design and user experience consultancy, in 2014. Since then, Capital One’s design team has grown to more than 500 Designers across the US, which changed the company’s approach and prepared it for the challenges of the last few months.</p>



<p>“Capital One’s commitment to design thinking, and how we approach a problem, benefits everyone – We all should be approaching problem-solving with open arms,” said Klaus Heesch, Director, Experience Design at Capital One, explaining that he and his team follow three key design principles, which have influenced the company as a whole.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“Be helpful and human – listen to your users and lead with empathy. Be harmless – do no harm. How safe are we keeping them? We have to be fair and just, we can’t just be fair. And finally, have contextual awareness. We need to understand and articulate the thing we’re solving for, to the systems and people who support it,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutterstock, a leading provider of stock photography, stock footage, stock music, is another example of a company that has doubled down on design as it grew, creating a culture of experimentation and innovation that is led by its Designers.</p>



<p>“We have an amazing UX team and they really just drive the conversation, from the tiniest spark of an idea to a full-fledged product that it ends up becoming. They’re curious, they’re talented, and great communicators, which from a director-level, makes it easy to support their ideas,”&nbsp; said Erin Essex, Shutterstock’s Director of UX and Product Design.</p>



<p>“Shutterstock helps foster this culture of creating a safe space where we can really spitball ideas and ideate quickly. We really do that from the lens of what is helpful to the customers, what is achievable, and how can we push those boundaries,” she said.</p>



<h3><strong>Be Agile and Adaptable</strong></h3>



<p>Harvard Business Review studied large organizations during a downturn and found that 14 percent actually accelerated growth and increased profitability. The most successful companies shared a few common traits:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>They all looked for new opportunities, understanding that their core products and services may have changed</li><li>They developed strategies that could better serve their customers, knowing that their customers (and their behavior) may have changed</li><li>They invested in products and services that helped their best customers when they needed help</li></ul>



<p>The New York Times, for example, recently pivoted its design roadmap to accelerate new features and projects, including expanding free access to high school students.</p>



<p>“We have an existing program with Verizon where students at Title 1 schools have free access to The Times and we thought, what if we could expand access? We had two weeks to completely launch something, so we reprioritized; We had more than 100 people come together across functions to work to double access to 14 million people,” said Tracie Lee, Product Design Director at The New York Times, adding that despite the urgency, a long-term lens is always required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was an immediate user need but it was also an opportunity to think about that relationship. Through user research we hear that people are exposed to The Times in school, so it&#8217;s a much longer game. It&#8217;s about that whole entire journey; a lifetime journey,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jason Mante, Founder and GM at Google’s Area 120, believes that to establish agility and adaptability, organizations need to cultivate an environment where change is not feared.</p>



<p>“[An essential skill set is] the ability to just change your mind and be okay and open with that. Be able to say ‘hey I&#8217;m changing my mind because I believe this new approach is going to better align with what we&#8217;re trying to do,’ Whether it&#8217;s the vision or the values that we&#8217;re trying to offer or not,” he said, adding that organizations can further facilitate adaptability by implementing structure and conventions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Define and build out a shared language amongst you and the team. Spending time upfront to make sure that you’re not constantly having to clarify language can help with decision-making.”    </p>



<h3><strong>Listen to Your Users (and Follow the Data)</strong></h3>



<p>The brands that have best adapted to the “new normal” are those that have adopted a data-driven approach to design and product development. Shutterstock is a case in point. </p>



<p>“We saw customer behavior shifting to the pandemic, at first they were searching for the virus itself, and in a couple of weeks we saw it shift to zoom backgrounds and things like that, and now the topics have shifted to homeschooling, education, and remote learning.  In looking at these trends … we were able to quickly ramp up groups of images that were related to these keyword searches,” said Essex, adding that Shutterstock has also used data to optimize web pages.</p>



<p>“Sometimes there&#8217;s those legacy things on the site and you think, ‘I don&#8217;t know if I want to fight for that right now,’ but it&#8217;s worth it. On native apps alone when we changed [the save] icon we saw an 86 percent increase in engagement,” she said, explaining that it’s always important to look outside the “standard” data channels.</p>



<p>“Consider data that might be overlooked, [&#8230;] go after things that you otherwise might be scared to go after and look outside the norm.”</p>



<p>Mante urges caution, though, arguing that the relative ease of new digital products can sometimes muddy the waters. </p>



<p>“I think the biggest challenge with these digital products is [that] because they&#8217;re so easily buildable there can be less care and and less commitment to clarity in it because it&#8217;s like ‘well we can fix it later,’” he said, adding that the key is always remembering who your products are for and why you’re creating them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Focus on the value that you&#8217;re offering. If you are opening a product or a feature and that primary value offering that you guys care about as a company is not screaming at the customer, you messed up – somebody didn&#8217;t say no somewhere.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Effray is a Digital Communications professional turned Innovation Consultant, who discovered her love for the design thinking process and a user-centric approach when taking BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Live User Experience (UX) Design</a> Certificate Course. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9442" style="width: 251px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9442" class="wp-image-9442" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06.jpg" alt="UX Design Student" width="241" height="388" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06.jpg 1030w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06-186x300.jpg 186w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06-636x1024.jpg 636w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9442" class="wp-caption-text">Summer Effray</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living and working in Kelowna, B.C., Summer wanted access to digital skills training but couldn’t make it to a physical campus location. We spoke with Summer about her experience learning in an Online Live classroom, and how she’s bringing the UX skills she gained throughout the course into her role as Innovation Consultant for the City of Kelowna.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a bit about your education and career background?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straight out of high school, I went to university and successfully completed a Bachelor of Arts with an English major from the University of Victoria (UVic). My first job after university was an administrative assistant with a financial investment firm in Kelowna, BC. After three and a half years there, I knew that administrative work, particularly in finance, wasn’t for me, so I found a new job at a local real estate development company as a development coordinator and then a marketing coordinator. During my short foray into marketing, I realized I was heading in a career direction that better fit my skills and interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pretty much brings me to my career with the City of Kelowna, which has spanned more than a decade. During my career in Communications, I took distance education through UVic to get my Public Relations Diploma, became a full-time permanent employee, was promoted several times to be one of the department’s senior Communicators, became a certified Communication Management Professional and served as a judge for the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) Gold Quill Awards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, I was in the Digital Communications portfolio, managing the City’s digital channels and strategy, which is what lead me to take the UX course from BrainStation. </span></p>
<p><b>Was the UX Design course helpful when moving into your new role?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UX course has served me well and was definitely an asset when I applied to my current position as an Innovation Consultant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that my commitment to continuous learning was one of the reasons that I got my current job. Working with the Intelligent Cities Manager, my job is to support smart city strategies and initiatives, help drive improvements to City service delivery, and foster a collaborative, data-driven and customer-centric culture.</span></p>
<p><b>What was your motivation behind taking the Online Live UX Design Course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to take the UX Design course because it looked like something that would help me in my job at the time as a Communications Consultant – managing websites and advising on digital channel development. It also seemed like a good way to spend some time exploring another potential career path, and I’ve always been interested in design. </span></p>
<p><b>What factors influenced your decision to take Online Live Learning rather than in-person?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I live in Kelowna and there is no BrainStation location here, and I work full-time, the online format was appealing and, honestly, necessary for me to be able to take the course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also received a <a href="https://brainstation.io/scholarships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainStation scholarship</a> and financial support from the City of Kelowna, which – along with the leeway to leave work a bit early on classroom days – enabled me to take the UX course. I am so thankful to have been given the support and flexibility that I needed to continue my education.</span></p>

</div>
<p><b>What were some of the most valuable skills you gained during the UX course? Have these skills aided your professional development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about design thinking; being user-centric; and the iterative process of sketching, wireframing, and prototyping. In my previous role, the course helped me to better advise web content providers about best practices, as well as begin the development of a set of online experience standards to help guide the expansion of the City’s digital channels – all while staying focused on the user experience and providing good customer service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Innovation Consultant, I have helped to bring service design thinking and processes to the City, and having some existing knowledge of design and user experience was pivotal in my ability to become a champion for this new (for Kelowna) way of doing things.</span></p>
<p><b>As an Innovation Consultant for the City of Kelowna, what does a typical day look like for you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day is different, but they usually start with some time spent reading about innovation and smart city initiatives and trends around the world. I might also have a meeting with my supervisor – the Intelligent Cities Manager – to regroup on what we are working on and coordinate any follow up that might be required relating to current projects or touchpoints with partners. A bit of each day is devoted to sharing what I’m working on with coworkers and probing to see if there are opportunities for collaboration with other staff or partners in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project work usually ends up being part of my day as well – we’re investigating the feasibility of a number of other initiatives including bringing AI to the City in the form of a website chatbot to help improve customer service and reduce the demand on staff resources to deal with simple, routine questions. I’m also developing and implementing a strategic communications plan to keep stakeholders updated on the Intelligent City Strategy and initiatives, as well as opportunities to work with us. </span></p>
<p><b>Have you been able to incorporate the skills you learned in the UX Design course into your role?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I’m currently working on creating resources for staff to help them adopt service design thinking and become more user-centric when improving or creating new services. Plus I’m involved in two major online service improvement projects that use service design thinking, UX design principles, and agile development methodologies.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you describe the Online Live learning experience? What was the highlight?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Online Live experience was different than other distance education courses that I’ve taken, because it actually felt like you were part of a class. This format was awesome because you’d start out learning about something through theory and then you would get a chance to practice with a real life example or application. I think this really solidifies things for a learner – it did for me anyway. The opportunities to break out into smaller groups during class was also great. Even though the classes were three hours long, they went by pretty fast because they were so engaging.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although women now make up half the workforce in the United States, it&#8217;s a well-known fact that the tech industry is dominated by men. According to Adeva, women hold about 25 percent of tech roles and that number drops even lower when looking at the number of women working in leadership roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help inspire the next generation of tech leaders and innovators, we&#8217;re featuring five women who are leading the way in the UX design industry for International Women&#8217;s Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From women who are breaking into the industry to UX leaders at some of the world&#8217;s most recognizable companies, here are some of the women who are championing diversity and acting as mentors in their field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Elizabeth Churchill&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10703" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10703" class="wp-image-10703 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10703" class="wp-caption-text">Source: EPIC</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no denying Churchill</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a female leader in UX design. With more than 20 years of experience, this Google exec has seen the industry come a long way and she&#8217;s not afraid to call out the idea that emotions are a female-only trait as &#8220;of course, nonsense.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Acknowledging emotional intelligence and emotionality as being fundamentally human means both men and women benefit in the long run,&#8221; said Churchill in an interview with </span><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-series-of-interviews-with-senior-ux-leaders-to-celebrate-international-womens-day-10dc6e354f26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her role as the Director of UX for Google&#8217;s Material Design (where she has five female and five male reports on her team), Churchill has also worked at tech giants including Yahoo!, Fuji Xerox, and eBay. Plus, she&#8217;s had a long academic career, written books about the design field, and is the current Secretary/Treasurer of the Association for Computing Machinery, the world&#8217;s largest scientific and educational computing society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Lizzie Kelly-Dyson and Georgie Bottomley</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10713" style="width: 898px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-duo-copy-e1583509846882.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10713" class="size-full wp-image-10713" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-duo-copy-e1583509846882.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="300"></a><p id="caption-attachment-10713" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Twelve Scholars and georgiebottomley.com</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Manchester-based Lizzie Kelly-Dyson and Georgie Bottomley wanted to meet more women in the UX design industry, they decided to do something about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started</span><a href="https://www.ladiesthatux.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladies That UX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because we didn&#8217;t know any women in the industry. Around eight people turned up for our first meeting, which was amazing because that&#8217;s eight people that we&#8217;ve never met before,&#8221; said Kelly-Dyson on a podcast called</span><a href="https://hubhopper.com/episode/lizzie-kelly-dyson-step-outside-your-comfort-zone-1579180067"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve Scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of the UX meetup quickly spread and today there are more than 30 Ladies That UX groups in cities across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. There&#8217;s no set format for a meeting, but each Ladies That UX group has a common theme: a community of women in UX who support each other, push the UX boundaries, and promote female skill and talent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope that every woman has the chance to achieve more through knowing she is not the only one out there, and by finding support in our community,&#8221; said Bottomley about the networking community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Jessica Gaddis</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10705" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10705" class="wp-image-10705 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10705" class="wp-caption-text">Source: jmgaddis.com</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite growing up with parents who worked in the industry and learning how to code at a young age,</span><a href="http://www.jmgaddis.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaddis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t see herself working in tech. It wasn&#8217;t until she pursued worked on a digital storytelling project in journalism school that she started to consider a career in the tech industry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Gaddis landed a product design role at Netflix and now works as a Product Designer at Twitter. In an interview for</span><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/interviews/women-ux-meet-jessica-gaddis-former-journalist-turned-self-taught-product-designer-netflix/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe&#8217;s XD Idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog, she spoke about some of the challenges of being a black woman in UX design, including a lack of awareness that UX jobs exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m passionate about giving young women all of the opportunities, all of the knowledge, and all of the information to make more informed decisions about their roles. Even if no one goes into design that’s a black woman ever again, I want women to be able to make those decisions for themselves and know that there is stuff out there for them that maybe they wouldn’t account for, or they wouldn’t even strive to,” said Gaddis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite achieving success at a young age, Zhou was not immune from a common experience many women in the tech industry face: the imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Experience makes anything look easy, but insecurities never fully disappear. This is true for everyone, especially true for women, and truer still for women in male-dominated fields,” said Zhou on </span><a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhou faced those feelings head-on in her much-loved book released last year, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check it out to find out more about Zhou’s experience of being a leader at a young age and how to unlock your confidence even when you feel like you don’t know what you’re doing.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about user experience (UX) in the context of shopping, we usually refer to the digital sphere, where UX Designers help to ideate, test, tweak and optimize every element of websites, apps and other products to ensure users will have the best-possible end-to-end eCommerce experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the same principles that have made UX Design such a crucial part in online shopping – that good design puts people first, blends eye-catching esthetics with an unwavering commitment to usability, and is backed by rigorous research and testing – are having a transformative effect on brick-and-mortar retail, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth pointing out just how important that is. U.S. Census data showed that eCommerce sales comprised 11.2 percent of total sales in the third quarter of 2019. So while eCommerce continues to take on a larger role in the overall retail landscape, it’s clear the vast majority of purchases are still being made in person at physical stores.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, the store is still the foundation of retailing,” observed BRP, a retail management consultancy, in its 2019 Special Report: The Future Store. “It is where the tactile and sensory experience comes together for the consumer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And companies adopting UX principles for all customer interactions – online or otherwise – are thriving; research by SAP, Siegel+Gale and Shift Thinking found that today’s top brands treat their customers as users, not buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the world’s top companies are getting quite creative in how they apply UX design concepts to optimize the experience of the people coming through their stores. Read on for a few of the ways UX has impacted retail.</span></p>
<h3><b>Invasion of the Pop-Ups</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we’ve pointed out that most shoppers are still making purchases in person, a store’s online presence is still crucial. Data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 63 percent of shopping occasions begin online, but the lines between the experience of shopping online and in-person are getting blurrier and blurrier as companies focus more attention on user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of how that’s manifested? More online retailers are pushing to establish physical spaces, if even for a short time in the form of pop-ups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital retailers like M.Gemi, Casper, and Allbirds have used pop-ups to introduce new products, to allow potential customers an up-close look at their products, and to generally create buzz and real-world visibility for their brands. Beauty startup Glossier has gone all-in on pop-ups, generating major media attention last year with six-to-eight week stints in cities including London, Seattle, and Miami. Clothing retailer Everlane, meanwhile, opened a few physical stores that don’t actually hold any stock so that potential customers could try on their wares before completing their purchase online (with free shipping).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online retailers that open brick-and-mortar locations report a five- to eight-fold increase in sales. But more than that, they also help to establish a relationship with customers and help potential buyers get a better feel for their products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stores serve as showrooms that drive customers online,” </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevendennis/2017/04/10/wall-streets-misguided-and-dangerous-fascination-with-retail-store-productivity/#3799f67b31f4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Steven Dennis in a Forbes op-ed warning Wall Street firms against closing too many physical stores. “Stores serve as fulfillment points for eCommerce operations. Stores are billboards for a retail brand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond online retailers looking to establish a physical presence – and perhaps a closer relationship with customers – the pop-up is also being used by established brands to lure shoppers in with one-of-a-kind experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muji opened a pop-up apartment in London to introduce its new home and clothing collections, inviting customers to masterclass workshops on topics including storage, Japanese beauty tutorials, and Instagram photography, while in New York the brand offered up a DIY essential oil bar and an embroidery service.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10624 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8.jpg" alt="Muji pop up apartment" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-established department stores, meanwhile, are increasingly bringing customers back by partnering with in-demand brands for splashy pop-ups. The first four floors of Bloomingdale’s locations in New York, L.A. and San Francisco feature the Carousel, a 1,500-square-foot “pop-in” with fresh designs and merchandise produced every two months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These pop-ups rarely just offer products; they instead try to bring other experiential benefits to not just bring customers through their doors, but also create a deeper connection to their brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our big focuses is to create these ever-changing and very exciting elements to continue to drive customers to our stores,” </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/pop-up-stores-are-the-next-big-retail-strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Justin Berkowitz, Men’s Fashion Director for Bloomingdale’s. “I really think that for the future of retail, (it’s important to make) brick-and-mortar a place where the customer really wants to come.” </span></p>
<h3><b>Using VR and AR to Improve the Shopping Experience </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s at least one advantage brick-and-mortar stores have that can’t be replicated on the web or your phone: the opportunity to showcase innovative new tech installations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many companies are understandably rushing to load their flagship stores with innovative new tools that most shoppers have likely never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the tech isn’t just about wowing guests with cool gimmicks – in fact, it’s all oriented around providing the best possible user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, how many of us really enjoy the process of dragging piles of clothing back to a cramped changeroom to see what fits? Well, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, and Selfridges have all partnered with 3D-body-scanning companies to help customers find the right fit without the changeroom headaches. A customer can get scanned in-store and the software then compares the measurements with the exact dimensions of the clothes on offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers are doing impressive things with augmented reality, too. Consider Ikea Place, an augmented reality app that allows shoppers to choose one of the furniture giant’s colorfully named products and drop it into their own home to see how it looks before buying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adidas, meanwhile, used AR to deepen the connection between its customers and its products. The shoe company’s Parley collection of shoes is made from plastic trash collected from remote beaches and coastal communities. The company installed AR displays in its retail stores that – with a snap of a photo from a customer – would physically show how the shoes on the shelf in front of them were created from recycled materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conscientious shoe brand TOMS used virtual reality to similarly help customers to understand the brand’s social impact. The company’s 360-degree Virtual Giving Trip lets potential customers see the impact of TOMS’ one-for-one business model by allowing them to virtually travel around the world and experience first-hand what it’s like to give a pair of TOMS shoes to a child in need.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.with.in/embed/toms-virtual-giving-trip" width="540" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, some companies are using the latest tech to both pamper their guests and give them all the benefits of shopping online in their brick-and-mortar locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Minkoff’s “connected” stores offer a range of impressive tech tricks to help ensure the best possible customer experience (they’re also smartly collecting data on which items are taken to the fitting room and whether those garments are then bought or left behind). The company’s sprawling Soho store features interactive screens that look like mirrors when they’re not activated. If shoppers give them a tap, they can browse company-curated lookbooks or order a free coffee or a glass of champagne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, RFID tags recognize all the items brought into the fitting room, and shoppers can then pull up screens showcasing the clothes styled in various ways, or browse other available size or colors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology – powered by eBay – led to sales tripling at that store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have focused on organizing stores around products, but our vision is organizing stores around customers,” </span><a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/rebecca-minkoff-digital-store/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Geisinger, eBay’s Head of Retail and Mobile Innovation. “Customers are demanding more experience, more engagement, and the feeling and the activity of shopping is more important than it used to be.”</span></p>
<h3><b>An Experience You Can’t Have at Home</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since online shopping is generally the most convenient option, many brands are working overtime to make sure that a visit to their store is worth the time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more, retailers are offering experiences and services that extend far beyond their central product offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the recreational apparel company Outdoor Voices, which has stores and pop-ups in cities around the U.S., none of which feel alike, instead reflecting their local environments. The brand’s San Francisco location pulls out all the stops, with a tearoom, in-store yoga classes, and meet-ups for jogging or dog-walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think of each store as a resource for recreation, and each needs to flex locally based on both the area and what type of activities people like to do there,” </span><a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/outdoor-voices-new-san-francisco-shop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Founder and CEO Tyler Haney. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies have opted to invest in at least one landmark location that serves to make people excited about their brand. Reinforcing the company’s connection to skateboarding culture, House of Vans London, for instance, is a 30,000 square-foot space that spans an art gallery, an artist incubator space, a cinema, a live music venue, a café and bars, a skater-built concrete bowl, mini-ramp, and street course. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10626 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London.jpg" alt="House of Vans London" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London.jpg 750w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Apple has in recent years refreshed its stores to provide an even better experience for customers. In 2016, Angela Ahrendts, the company’s Senior Vice President of Retail, unveiled innovations that included a tree-lined Genius Grove (replacing the Genius Bar), the introduction of “Creative Pros” offering specialized advice on a range of artistic topics, and a new program where customers would have the opportunity to attend sessions and community events within the Apple space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s funny, we actually don’t call them ‘stores’ anymore. We call them ‘town squares’ because they’re gathering places for 500 million people who visit us every year,” Ahrendts </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/meet-the-woman-who-wants-to-change-the-way-you-buy-your"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><b>Personalization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of eCommerce, brands are increasingly focused on trying to anticipate what you want and when you want it. According to the Boston Consulting Group, companies that use advanced personalization methods can realize an improvement of 20 percent or greater in their net promoter scores, while seeing incremental revenue growth of 10 percent or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the flow of data available online makes it easy to know everything about the people browsing your web products. You don’t have that same treasure trove of background information about the people physically browsing your store, but that’s not stopping brands from getting creative about personalizing brick-and-mortar shopping experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One effective method? Loyalty programs. According to BCG’s numbers, 130 million Americans are now members of a restaurant loyalty program, more than twice as many as in 2015. More than two-thirds of diners are members of at least one such program, and a quarter belong to three or more. BCG’s numbers show that restaurant companies with “well-defined, strategically executed” loyalty programs can boost incremental revenues by 10 to 15 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at Starbucks, whose loyalty program is hailed as an industry leader. Starbucks tailors messages and offers to its members based on their past ordering habits. Haven’t had a latte for a few days? Starbucks might lure you in the door with a half-price offer, or by enticing you with bonus stars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a huge success. According to Starbucks’ 2019 third-quarter results, active Starbucks Rewards Membership in the U.S. increased 14 percent year-over-year to 17.2 million users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made massive investments and made progress on personalization, ahead of what I would say other restaurant brands to date have been able to accomplish,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/personalized-fast-food-experiences"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Martin, a Partner at BCG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies are tapping into apps to personalize their brick-and-mortar stores. If you walk into a Best Buy, for example, the app will enter “local store” mode with relevant push notifications, while Nike app users at its midtown Manhattan flagship can tap into advice from one-on-one stylists or create customized products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those companies that aren’t yet able to leverage technology to offer a personalized in-store experience in real-time can do more to cater to their customers. The same data that provides such valuable insights about a store’s online users can be leveraged to create an in-store experience that appeals to its unique customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that we’re focused a lot on right now is using all of this data, and feedback, and information to personalize experiences,” </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/8-experts-on-the-future-of-retail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Anne Savoie, Director of Customer Experience at Mejuri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s no longer ‘who is our target market?’ but ‘who are our customers?’ Each persona deserves to be communicated to uniquely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has also allowed retailers to take personalization to the next level by creating customized gear on the spot. The Nike By You Studio uses augmented reality, object tracking, and projection systems to allow users to make custom kicks they can pick up just an hour later, while luxury handbag brand launched the Coach Create design-it-yourself experience at its New York flagship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ministry of Supply permanently installed a pricey 3D-knitter in its Boston flagship to allow customers to design and create their own blazers (and other wares) on demand. Ministry of Supply Co-Founder Aman Advani said that giving people the option to customize products isn’t just about generating sales, but more about the overall experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These stores transform into places where you go to learn more about the brand, to help create your product, to understand who is behind the product, to connect with the person who your online inquiry was answered by,” he </span><a href="https://qz.com/956745/retail-experiments-from-farfetch-nike-and-amazon-offer-visions-of-the-store-of-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They become much more beacons of the brand and much less just transactional retail machine.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic design and UX design have elements in common, starting with their names — but the two roles also have some big differences when it comes to the focus and responsibilities.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the dawn of history, people have been using graphic design as a way to get a message across, be it modern logos and branding or ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design also has its roots in centuries-old approaches for figuring out how products resonate with the public. But it’s also a role that’s distinctly rooted in our high-tech age, where the graphics are just one piece of the equation when it comes to building digital offerings.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it wasn’t until 1995 that the job title even existed. Don Norman</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;is thought to be the first “user experience” professional after he asked for the moniker upon joining Apple to help research and design a new line of human-centered products.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s the overlap between the two roles? And how, exactly, do they differ — and complement — each other?</span></p>



<h2><b>What is Graphic Design?</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, graphic design focuses on branding, typography, and the overall principles of design composition: shapes, lines, colors and the overall aesthetic.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through their craft, graphic designers inspire emotions and responses,” </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/difference-between-graphic-designerui-designer-ux-farhan-khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writes Designer Farhan Khan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on LinkedIn. “A Graphic Designer will know that users will respond very differently to text written in the much-maligned Comic Sans font as opposed to in old-fashioned Courier New font.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a role that you’ll find at an advertising firm, designing an array of print or digital marketing materials like banner ads, business cards, and flyers. It’s also a job that’s integral to many web design companies, with graphic designers often creating logos or icons that feed into the work of web designers and developers.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also typically about static graphics — not interactive elements on a website or animations.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Projects typically have a very defined scope and budget in mind,” notes multi-disciplinary Designer Christine Maggi on her YouTube channel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DesignGal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with client specifications being clear on the vision and requirements, be it nitty-gritty details like page margins or dimensions or bigger-picture elements like the final deadline.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic design, given its narrow focus, is just one piece of user experience design.</span></p>



<p><b>What is UX Design?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Graphic Designers are typically focusing on individual outputs — say, a newly-redesigned corporate logo — UX Designers are looking at the bigger picture of how all the moving pieces in a product work together and how users interact with it.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For UX experts, it’s also not just about how a product, app or website looks, though that’s an important aspect. It’s about how customers experience it.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UX Designers tend to be concerned with three primary factors — usability, look, and feel,” </span><a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/ux-design-for-graphic-designers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writes Nick Babich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Adobe’s blog.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes it a “human-first” approach to design that’s all about creating products that people can experience with ease and delight, he adds. “UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining that insight means layers of research, prototyping, and testing, making it a role that often stretches far beyond the straightforward scope of graphic design projects.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A given design problem has no single right answer,” writes Khan. “UX Designers explore many different approaches to solving a specific user problem.”</span></p>



<p><b>The Differences Between Graphic Design and UX Design</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re very different jobs, no doubt, but the two roles often work closely.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can think of it like your experience at a restaurant: A Graphic Designer would make the logo, designed the window displays, and created the menu and branding. A UX Designer would keep an eye on all those things too — while also researching and evaluating the way customers use the space, and how they feel about their experience interacting with all the elements at play.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, there’s lots of overlap. UX Designers rely on the skills of Graphic Designers to make projects come to life, and both approaches are often crucial on modern digital teams.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also not uncommon for Designers to bounce between these job titles over their career, particularly once they’ve expanded their skillset with <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog_roseInterview&amp;utm_campaign=graphicdesignvsuxdesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX design courses</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Corbet Fawcett, the Director, UX Research at Scotiabank Digital Factory, recently led at a talk at the BrainStation Toronto campus on lightweight user research methods and their importance to overall user experience (UX) design.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We caught up with Corbet t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o find out more about the UX research process and what makes a good Researcher. </span></p>
<p><b>BrainStation: What is the mission of Scotiabank Digital Factory? </b><b>What problem were you looking to solve?</b></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10596" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett-300x300.jpeg" alt="Corbet Fawcett" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett-109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Corbet-Fawcett.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fawcett: If you joined us for one of our Town Halls you’d hear our leaders talk about “reinventing relationships with our customers, shareholders, and employees.” We’re focused on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyday personal banking, but specifically the digital version of that – banking via your phone or laptop or tablet. Our challenge is to create digital experiences that are just as reliable, convenient, and accessible as in-person banking. </span></p>
<p><b>You have a background in technical writing and content development. How important do you think that background has been to your current position and your professional development as a whole? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I’d definitely say it was critical. Writing is a pivotal skill for success. It’s more than having a good vocabulary and putting words together – it’s understanding how to communicate, how to persuade, how to inform, how to craft a story that’s powerful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of the key tools we use when crafting experiences. The right words are as powerful as other design elements. Even just a few words can motivate, encourage, delight, or advise. They can transform transactional moments into memorable moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing is also a powerful medium for sharing insights with stakeholders and customers, and it’s invaluable for creating a presence in the broader world, for becoming a thought leader.</span></p>
<p><b>What design trends do you see coming?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s always a lot of chatter about trends. We hear a lot about technologies like AI and autonomous vehicles and augmented reality and so on. But in terms of things that will impact UX design and research? I think we’ll see big changes around virtual assistants because voice interaction is becoming important and means a different kind of design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think service design will continue to grow as a level that more and more companies consider. It will challenge us to think beyond the boundaries of apps and sites and physical products and think about experiences at a higher level. I also think design for accessibility has been gaining focus but will take a big jump forward in the next couple of years. </span></p>
<p><b>How does </b><b>Scotiabank Digital Factory </b><b>stay ahead of the curve?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank does a lot to help us stay current. For example, we have this great Digital Discovery Zone that regularly brings in speakers to talk about emerging trends and other topics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Digital Factory, we’ve grown our service design practice a lot in the past year; it’s exciting to see it gain steam. And accessibility and inclusivity have been a pillar of our design practice since the very beginning but it’s something we continue to build on. For example, our Accessibility team is creating our first Empathy Lab in 2020. It’s a big project, but it’s a new way of connecting with customers and understanding their needs so I’m really excited to see how it develops.</span></p>
<p><b>How do you see Scotiabank’s customer journey changing in the future? What do you foresee for the banking industry as a whole? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of new Fintechs and these are changing the shape of things for a lot of customers. People have more options for how to manage their money, track their spending, plan for goals. There are also more threats, which are making topics like security and trust vitally important to more and more people. Put these trends together and the shape of banking is changing. Banks will need to offer different services and be just as intensely customer-focused as the next new startup. </span></p>
<p><b>You recently led a talk on campus about &#8220;lightweight&#8221; user research methods. What does this refer to and why is it important?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. This is something I’m pretty passionate about. It’s a really useful approach. Sometimes you don’t have the luxury of time for a lot of research. Or maybe time isn’t the issue, maybe the problem is that there’s little or no budget. When that’s true it can be tempting to skip research entirely, but that leaves you with high risks. Research answers questions that, unanswered, might result in products or features that customers don’t want, don’t use, or can’t use. So there’s a pretty high risk to skipping research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here’s the thing – there’s almost always something you can do with the time and resources you have. This is where lightweight research helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I define this type of research as anything you can turn around in one to three days, using minimal resources and just the people you have easy access to. We’re talking about micro-studies. They’re very tactical. You generally aim to answer a single question, or at most two or three. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I spoke at BrainStation we covered a number of options, including polls, surveys, coffee shop intercepts, and so on. We talked about the importance of understanding the limitations of each method, and how you can combine methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world maybe you’d take weeks to do comprehensive research, but if your team just needs to answer one critical question by next week? Lightweight research methods get you there quickly and arm your teams with more knowledge than they started with.</span></p>
<p><b>What would you say are the most important elements of the UX research process?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good question, and I think there’s more than one answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area that’s important is helping teams understand what type of research they need, and when to do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another aspect is designing research that delivers actionable results. I like treating research like a design challenge. If you came to me asking for a study I’d probably ask you things like, “What decisions are you trying to make? What observations would help you make that decision?” Knowing that helps us craft a study that results in those insights. We’re essentially imagining an actionable result and then reverse engineering to figure out how to get the types of insights we need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there’s a third, incredibly important element: Creating investment in research. That’s all about making research a partnership, a collaboration between UX Researchers, Designers, and product teams. Research is a tool to help other teams make decisions, so it’s not something that can happen in a silo. Creating strong partnerships is essential.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0N5A0283.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10604 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0N5A0283-1024x683.jpg" alt="UX research" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0N5A0283-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0N5A0283-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0N5A0283-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/0N5A0283-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><b>What is the most challenging aspect of that UX research process? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A challenge for research, in general, is that you can’t make people act on insights. You can’t make people be invested. You can’t change people. That’s why we treat research as a partnership with our teams. We invite them to join us in the planning, the sessions, and the synthesis so that they become just as invested in the results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worked well for us, and we’re lucky to work with a lot of interested and engaged people.</span></p>
<p><b>What does the team structure at Design Factory look like? How many Researchers are on your team?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve actually just grown. For the past year there have been just three of us, but we’re excited to be welcoming a fourth person this month. We support a lot of teams so we’re pretty busy, but many of the teams we work with include Designers who are passionate about research, so we have extra support on some projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change in the past few months is an awesome team-up with another group. We’re now paired with the Digital Factory’s Customer Advocacy team. The advocacy team helps run beta programs, supports a customer community, and manages our digital NPS program. We’re essentially sister teams; we both try to deliver customer feedback and insights to design and product teams. This promises to make 2020 extra interesting as we find ways to collaborate and create an end-to-end insights practice.</span></p>
<p><b>When it comes to hiring, are you looking for specific skills Or overall fit? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes! By which I mean both. I don’t worry too much about specific tools – those are relatively easy to pick up. So, for example, it doesn’t matter to me whether someone prefers Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD. What matters is that they use one of those because it’s a sign that they’re comfortable visualizing concepts. If they’ve learned one program they’ll pick up another no problem – what’s important is the underlying skill of visual communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are non-digital skills that I definitely look for. Things like moderation, establishing rapport, and rapid ideation. These are really important. I look for people who’d done a range of things. If I’m hiring for research I’m looking for people who’ve used a range of methods. I’m looking for creative problem solvers who can flex and brainstorm approaches to any new challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And fit? Team fit is tricky. It’s not something you can create or train for, so it’s a big thing I look for in interviews. </span></p>
<p><b>What traits do you think make a great Designer these days?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s an interesting question. There are good Designers and there are great designers. The same is true for researchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good ones are very customer-focused, who really consider and advocate for customers. They also wear a business lens and try to understand how their projects create value for the organization as well as their customers. They’re creative and always explore more than one way of solving a problem, whether that’s a design problem or a research challenge. They embody a positive attitude towards collaboration and towards taking and using feedback. Those are the traits of a good Designer or Researcher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But exceptional Designers and Researchers? They go to another level. I think a number of things make a difference. One is ownership, a deep investment in every aspect of anything they work on, and a vision they advocate for and even co-create with the business and customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than that, truly great Designers and Researchers go beyond the job. They value and actively create a culture of design and customer focus. I’ve had the pleasure of working with some exceptional Designers and Researchers, and that’s one thing I’ve seen in all of them.</span></p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-web-developers-need-to-learn-ux">Why Web Developers Need to Learn UX</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog">BrainStation® Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of Web Developers are committed to continuous learning. In fact, BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2020-results/development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that a massive 80 percent of Web Developers feel that digital skills training would make them more successful.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s plenty to suggest that Web Developers would be best-served by immersing themselves in the world of user experience design and </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Nsg2md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few reasons why.</span></p>



<h2>Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you start to learn UX, you’re likely to find that you won’t have to stray too far from your comfort zone. In fact, the biggest benefit of learning UX might be how organically it relates to your existing experience as a Developer.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although UX design spans many more platforms than the trusty browser, web design is of course still a massive part of the job; in fact, BrainStation’s survey found that 74 percent of UX design respondents are designing for the web.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your knack for elegant aesthetics – and the mastery of typography, color, illustration, and imagery – will be highly valued within the UX sphere, as well as your ability to code and conduct some level of testing and research (though, as we’ll cover, you’re about to push deeper into that area than ever before).</span></p>



<h2><b>You’ll Become a Better Developer</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User experience spans every single interaction that users have with a product. While we did point out that there’s a significant overlap between the roles, there’s simply no denying that a UX Designer has to look at products with a broader scope.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UX Designer must juggle a huge number of considerations – including visual design, user research, content strategy, usability and accessibility, information architecture, and overall business goals – while also knowing how to effectively steer a project and communicate findings to a broad array of stakeholders.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to differentiate might be to say that Web Developers are motivated by solving problems for their clients, while UX Designers solve problems for their users. UX Designers, like Developers, concern themselves with the look, feel, and usability of a product or experience, but they also have to balance those considerations with a bevy of other priorities, including broader business goals.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Web Developers are likely already involved with designing, prototyping and testing their products, but learning the more thorough iterative UX design process can be illuminating.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UX Designer usually begins by identifying a problem, before becoming immersed in research – spanning user interviews, experience maps, Task Flows, analytic observations, demographic studies, or custom-drafted personas – to understand the behavior, needs, and frustration points of users. Building from those observations, the UX Designer then creates prototypes and wireframes before subjecting their design to a rigorous loop of building, testing, improving, and re-testing.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few positions in web development offer the opportunity to become well-versed in all of those areas, but certainly, any Web Developer would benefit from having a more holistic understanding of the products they’re creating and how users are interacting with them.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today&#8217;s digital products are less about ‘can technology do this’ and more about ‘how well can we do this?’” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-a-web-developer-take-a-UX-or-UI-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fahd Arshad, UX Strategist with Bloomberg.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UX as a process, as a set of tools, and as a frame of mind for product development is a huge part of this equation. Hence any Web Developer would find it worth their time to take a formal course in UX. Either they will be better partners later on for UX specialists or have the opportunity to introduce design thinking to their team, radically improving the chances of their collective success.”</span></p>



<h2>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/will-ai-replace-web-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Web Developers shouldn’t fear the rise of automation, but instead, embrace the ways in which AI and machine learning can help perform their jobs more efficiently and invest further in the skills that can’t be adequately replicated by a robot.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those skills and qualities include:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Empathy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the core principle of UX Design is understanding what people want and designing products with that in mind.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: possessing a better understanding of the end-to-end product lifecycle will allow Developers to communicate intelligently with a broad array of people inside and outside of their team. “This will reduce the ‘wall’ between Designers and (Developers) for them to be able to work together seamlessly and effectively,” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-a-web-developer-take-a-UX-or-UI-course"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joseph Vedua, Principal UX Designer at Infor Hook &amp; Loop.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Prototyping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: though many Developers will have some level of experience with prototyping, it’s not quite the same in a UX context; BrainStation’s survey found that on a day-to-day basis, 52.1 percent of Designers focused most of their time on prototyping.</span></li></ul>



<h2>Ux Designers Are Among the Most Sought-after Specialists in Tech</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t heard, talented UX Designers are hard to find – and harder to hire.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;UX Designer as the fifth-most in-demand role in tech, remarkable given that many companies are still lagging way behind in shifting the appropriate amount of attention to user experience.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly, there’s a huge gap between businesses that embrace UX strategies and those that don’t,” </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/01/23/how-ux-is-transforming-business-whether-you-want-it-to-or-not/#2e2504b0580e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Andrew Kucheriavy, founder and CEO of Intechnic. “In fact, it can be the difference between surviving or drowning.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It follows then that an Adobe study canvassing 500 managers and department heads in UX design found that 87 percent of managers said hiring more UX Designers was their organization’s top priority and 73 percent vowed to hire more UX Designers over the next five years.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it also makes sense that those with UX skills are being rewarded handsomely for that expertise. According to Indeed, UX Designers bring home an average salary of $89,250 compared to $74,450 for Web Developers.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t have a career change in mind, there’s something else to consider when it comes to the shortage in UX skills: if your company doesn’t have any or enough UX Designers, gaining that skillset could make you indispensable at the office.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Knowing what makes a good user experience would definitely make you a better developer. I think it’s important for Front-End (Developers) to know this, especially since many times companies don’t have UX Designers working on projects,” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-a-web-developer-take-a-UX-or-UI-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ana Vasquez, UI/UX Designer at Mobomo.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are the one making these decisions, and it will make the product better for users.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one knows better than UX Designers how seemingly small tweaks to usability and efficiency can, in fact, make a massive difference to a user’s experience.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, while few spend more time browsing the web than Designers, even the savviest among us might not be maximizing the quality of that experience.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we rounded up 11 of the best Chrome extensions for Designers.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-video-recorder-scree/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Loom</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, you spend a fairly significant amount of time trying to communicate with other teammates about issues relating to user-flows, design issues or other bugs. Loom can make your life much easier.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension allows you to record and narrate a video of what you see on your screen – as well as your front-facing camera – before sharing it with a simple link.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re sold on Loom, consider the premium paid service, which allows 4K video, unlimited video storage, drawing tools, mouse click emphasis, and a suite of editing options including call-to-action buttons and custom thumbnails.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Window Resizer</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers need to know how everyone will experience their web offerings, and a layout that looks beautiful on your screen – which, let’s face it, is likely top-of-the-line – might flop on an aging iPhone.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Window Resizer will help solve that blind spot, resizing the browser window to reproduce an array of screen resolutions. You can customize your list of resolutions, you can fiddle with the window’s size and position, and for extra efficiency, the extension also allows you to create global key shortcuts.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/muzli-2-stay-inspired/glcipcfhmopcgidicgdociohdoicpdfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Muzli</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you could use a little extra design inspiration in your day – and who couldn’t? – Muzli is for you, curating engaging visual designs from all over the web to scroll through while you sip your morning coffee.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 150 sources from around the Internet including Dribbble, Mashable, and Product Hunt, Muzli will bring you the freshest design ideas, projects, and news each time you open a new tab.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See something that interests you? Click through and learn more in a new browser window.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Page Ruler</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designers tend to have an appreciation for a simple but effective idea, and that sums up Page Ruler.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of wasting time carefully measuring the size of objects on a web page using the screenshot tool, get Page Ruler to quickly draw out a ruler and size up pixel dimensions and positionings as well as any elements on a page.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>ColorZilla</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s likely that you often have occasion to quickly find out which color is being used on a webpage – and ColorZilla can help you get there that much faster.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long one of the most popular Firefox extensions before finally coming to Chrome, ColorZilla features an advanced eyedropper to determine the color of any pixel on any page, a CSS gradient generator, and a color picker.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you see a color you like, ColorZilla makes it a breeze to take the hex and RGB values and paste them into your clipboard.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontface-ninja/eljapbgkmlngdpckoiiibecpemleclhh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Fontface Ninja</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you the type to scour the Internet for fresh font ideas? Designers – and font fanatics in general – will want to install this elegant extension, which lets you identify fonts used on any website and quickly slip them into your design software.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fontface Ninja’s “Fonts DNA engine” doesn’t just display the CSS name, but the real name of any displayed font, then lets you try it out legally. If you like it, Fontface Ninja also provides a link to buy the appropriate license.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spectrum/ofclemegkcmilinpcimpjkfhjfgmhieb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Spectrum</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s estimated that color vision deficiency – also known as color blindness – affects millions around the world. To ensure those people have a positive experience with your web pages, try Spectrum, which quickly tests websites to see how they appear to people with different types of color blindness.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension is said to be especially helpful for websites with data visualizations since some colors in the charts could be indistinguishable from one another.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checkbot-seo-web-speed-se/dagohlmlhagincbfilmkadjgmdnkjinl?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Checkbot</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that all of your links actually work, that your forms are secure and that your site is fast and easy to navigate are all major usability concerns for a UX Designer; Checkbot will have your back and unearth any problems you haven’t noticed.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing hundreds of pages at once, Checkbot can discover broken links, HTML/JavaScript/CSS errors, duplicate titles, security issues, redirect chains and mixed content errors.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Checkbot tests your site for 50-plus best practices for SEO, speed, and security.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/svg-grabber-get-all-the-s/ndakggdliegnegeclmfgodmgemdokdmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>SVG Grabber</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you frequently finding yourself needing to nab logos, icons, illustrations or other artwork from other websites? If so, SVG Grabber could save you a lot of time and tedium.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a tool to help you quickly preview and get all the SVG assets from a website. With just a single click, the extension will automatically reel in all the SVGs on a page before letting you sift through and quickly download the ones you need.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ux-check/giekhiebdpmljgchjojblnekkcgpdobp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>UX Check</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, UX Check turns heuristic evaluations into a breeze.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extension lets you scan your website for usability issues so you can test without having real users. UX Check flags any areas of your site that need to be improved based on Nielsen Norman Group’s </span><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 general principles for interaction design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which include visibility of system status, error prevention, and consistency and standards – and saves a screenshot of the issue.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re done, you can export everything to a document file to share easily with teammates.</span></p>



<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/corporate-ipsum/lfmadckmfehehmdnmhaebniooenedcbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Corporate Ipsum</b></a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re testing a new design – particularly one that’s especially text-heavy – you might be sick of the usual first paragraph of Lorem Ipsum. For those Latin-weary among us, Corporate Ipsum is a fun extension that randomly conjures corporate double-speak for use as filler text.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of that long chain of dummy text you’re used to seeing, you might be greeted instead by – for example – corporate jargon like this: “efficiently seize integrated vortals with installed base methodologies.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merely having English words instead of Latin will make the design look far more natural, and the fact that the randomly assembled text often doesn’t make any sense at all is simply part of the extension’s charm.</span></p>
