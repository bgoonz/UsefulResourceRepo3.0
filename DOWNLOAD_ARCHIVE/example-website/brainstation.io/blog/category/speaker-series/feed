<p><strong>Women in Digital Leadership | Shaping Stronger Pathways</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 25th, and featured a stellar lineup of women in digital leadership representing Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics and Instacart.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/529460562" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>



<p>As the tech industry grows, women are making up a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before – but much work remains to be done. While equitable participation across the industry as a whole is a laudable benchmark, it’s not enough. Representation in every job category and at all levels of seniority remains a challenge. Many of the obstacles to better representation in digital leadership are structural, and will require structural changes to fix. Fortunately, there are programs in place, and as their success in helping women achieve positions of leadership grows, so too does the opportunity to kick off a virtuous cycle. </p>



<p>The event lineup included six women in positions of leadership at prominent global companies: Verizon, Mastercard, Harry’s Labs, The Space Foundation, Pymetrics, and Instacart. Together, our panelists weighed in on the importance of the initiatives already in place, issues that still need to be confronted, and what can women do as individuals to advance themselves and others in their careers. These are just a few of the many great points that arose during our discussion.</p>



<h2><strong>Mentorship Is the Key to Bridging the First Step</strong></h2>



<p>The transition into management can be an especially difficult one for women – an early inequality that can impact women’s careers over the long term. Shelli Brunswick, Chief Operating Officer at The Space Foundation, explains, “As you’re looking to make that first step on the ladder to being a leader, finding a mentor, a champion, and a coach can be critical..”. She also emphasizes the importance of paying it forward, saying that “once you have a mentor, always remember that you can be a mentor to and help the next generation behind you.”</p>



<p>Often, finding a mentor begins with networking. As Vice President of Product Innovation at Verizon Sanyogita Shamsunder says, “Be open, be collaborative, communicate, go talk to others about their projects and show genuine interest in their work. And get help. The first person that you approach may not may not be open or receptive, but don’t give up. Keep talking to people, both men and women, junior to you, senior to you – it doesn’t matter. We need to communicate. There’s no substitute for that.”</p>



<p>But besides being open to all networking opportunities, what can we do to find mentors – especially the right ones? To start with, it can’t hurt to ask. “You should always be looking for people that you have an affinity with, who really believe in you, and who are willing to go to bat for you when times are tough,” says Frida Polli, CEO &amp; Co-founder of A.I.-powered recruitment platform Pymetrics. “You definitely need to be reaching out to those folks…Just continually be looking for folks that appreciate and believe in what you’re doing.”</p>



<p>Still, approaching a possible mentor can be intimidating. As Tehmina Haider, Vice President and Head of Harry’s Labs at Harry’s Inc., says, “When you ask someone to be a mentor, you’re asking them for their time. The more senior they are, the more precious their time is. So it is a big ask, [but] most leaders actually enjoy seeing other people grow; that’s why they became leaders.” And overcoming your reluctance to approach mentors will pay off: “You need folks who can supplement you in different ways, to have that diversity. Women, because they tend to identify with other women, do often reach out to a female mentor, but you want your mentors to have different points of view than you do. And that’s where pushing for those male mentors is really, really important. So take that leap.</p>



<p>Vice President of Digital &amp; Cybersecurity Solutions at Mastercard Sukhmani Dev concurs, and emphasizes that finding a mentor is sometimes a question of timing. “Things happen organically as you grow forward. I find that [potential mentors] need to have a sense of who you are and what you’re capable of, and have seen you in action…If I really enjoyed working with a boss of mine, and then I’m changing roles or they’re changing roles, I may ask them, ‘Let’s continue the dialogue.’ It was more of a formal ask when I was more junior…but [where I am now], you just call them up when you have a question.”</p>



<p>Darrah Joy-Clay, Account Director of CPG Brands at Instacart, encourages women to ask for what they need. “As I’ve grown in my role, I find that the negotiations become a lot more complex. And when I’m going through a negotiation, of course I consult my female mentors. But it’s my male mentors who really give me that extra level of confidence, and re-emphasize not to be shy or fearful of making an ask of what I’m deserving of, or what I need to be happy and fulfill my role.”</p>



<h2><strong>Support Isn’t Just a Relationship – It’s Also a Culture</strong></h2>



<p>Advocating for yourself is important – but so is advocating for each other. How can companies help to support their female employees and foster a culture that supports women? Several panelists mentioned how important it is to carve out space for women to speak, to encourage them to speak, and to draw attention to their contributions and successes, which can get overlooked in environments structured around male authority. As always, mentorship is important. But even the way we provide day-to-day feedback can help, though criticism can be hard to receive – and to give.</p>



<p>As Haider explains, delivering criticism is about “making sure that the women on your team understand that the feedback that you’re giving them, even if it’s sometimes not that great to hear, is coming from a place of really caring about them. And that’s really hard, as a leader. Giving difficult feedback is not the easiest thing to do, but you’ve got to invest in it, and you’ve got to make sure that folks understand why it’s actually an indication of how much you care.”</p>



<p>For Joy-Clay, that’s aided by an environment where leadership is able to be transparent and talk about their own successes and failures without fear of judgment. “When I share my journey to leadership and I’m transparent with my teams, they can identify and relate with some of the experiences that I’ve had,” she says. “Several mentors of mine who have, one, shared their personal journey with me. But secondly, they’ve exposed me to communities and to rooms and to opportunities that I may not have been in before…and that exposure, I think, is a huge opportunity for leaders and mentees.”</p>



<h2><strong>Policies Need to Acknowledge There Are Many Paths</strong></h2>



<p>While cultivating a supportive environment may seem like an enigmatic exercise, it ultimately comes down to the policies a company puts in place. As Shamsunder says, “One of the first things that we have to do to create programs [to support women] is to recognize that there is an inequality.” This often starts with highlighting the different ways that people contribute to the company – including people with different levels of educational attainment, people in different locations.</p>



<p>There are many paths to STEM, and overlooking some in favor of others is detrimental to employees following unorthodox paths, which often includes women. At Mastercard, Dev explains, “We have a particular program that [assists] women who want to change their careers midway through – nurturing that and helping them explore different areas, explore technological areas.”</p>



<p>Spreading opportunity around isn’t as simple as promoting women up the corporate ladder. And it doesn’t happen by accident. At The Space Foundation, Brunswick says, they take a multi-pronged approach specifically designed to tackle the problem from different angles: raising awareness of careers in STEM, providing more people with access and training, helping to connect potential STEM workers to opportunity, and finally, mentoring to encourage equity in leadership. “Our goal at the Space Foundation is to highlight all those career paths. And we would say it’s about diversity and inclusion, but those underrepresented groups could be rural communities or inner cities, as well as regions of the world.” Matching protégés to mentors is an important step, but it’s just one of many; promoting more women into digital leadership roles in STEM means nurturing an entire talent pipeline that begins with reaching out to girls early in their education and letting them know that they can find a place in STEM.</p>



<p>And more women in STEM is good not only for women: “What we’ve learned is when women around the world are empowered to be entrepreneurs, they elevate not only themselves but their families and their communities as well,” Polli says. “It’s valuable to our entire world and ecosystem to empower women, to provide them the financing and support them in becoming entrepreneurs.”</p>



<h2><strong>Confidence Can Be a Greater Obstacle Than Competence</strong></h2>



<p>Confidence looks different in different people, and in situations with a gender imbalance, women may be at a disadvantage. Here, leadership can help to rebalance the scales, for example, by specifically calling on younger talent to speak up. “Leaders have a key role to play. If you’re on a table where you have young talent and they’re not speaking up, it’s your responsibility to pause and ask them for their point of view, create a space that they feel comfortable in…We can just take two minutes out of our time as leaders to convey that to younger talent. You’ll make them that much more comfortable and confident going forward and feel like their voice is appreciated,” Dev says.</p>



<p>For that younger talent, learning to overcome fear&nbsp; takes practice. “One [strategy] is to give more time and attention to your emotional skills, in terms of developing yourself and your emotional responses to rejection, to negative consequences,” Joy-Clay advises. “If we develop that muscle, that emotional response will be less fearful of what the consequences are on the other end.” This becomes ever easier the more willing leadership is to make space for failure and drop the expectation of perfection. “We have to start speaking more about our failures,” Joy-Clay continues. “If we talk more broadly about the mistakes we’ve made, the failures we’ve had, that would empower more young female leaders to not be afraid to fail, and not be afraid to be their authentic selves in the workplace.”</p>



<p>To Polli, it’s less a question of having confidence and more about how men and women project their confidence differently. “What it means to look confident is actually a very male image,” she says, explaining that what may seem like a lack of confidence is actually a decision not to project overconfidence. The solution is “more about having enough women in positions of leadership that can present an alternative image of what confidence looks like, rather than everyone feeling like, ‘I need to fit the mold of male confidence.’”</p>



<p>On one hand, Haider says, “It’s about pushing women to be confident, be bold, and really demonstrate that confidence externally. But it’s also about changing the metrics that we have around what confidence is, so that the way women show up also feels resonant.”</p>

<p><strong>The Great Acceleration</strong> – the latest instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series &#8211; took place on February 25 and featured leaders from <strong>Peloton</strong>, <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>KraftHeinz</strong>, <strong>Snyk</strong>, and<strong> Betterment</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the recap here:</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/516922129" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p></p>



<h2>Forming Digital-First Teams</h2>



<p>Following the unprecedented challenges 2020 presented to the world, BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Skills Survey looked to explore the state of digital transformations and what companies could be doing to build upon existing efforts to embrace a digital-first culture.</p>



<p>The survey found that digital acceleration shows no signs of slowing down, as 77 percent of organizations said they plan to increase their digital transformation activities and 80 percent said there are digital elements of their business that did not exist even two years ago.</p>



<p>Dipti Salopek, VP of People at Snyk said, “All companies are software companies now. Anything you consider standard retail is now e-commerce. It was going to be the way of the world and COVID just accelerated it.”</p>



<p>Global stay-at-home orders also saw the acceleration of remote work and the growth of international teams.</p>



<p>Brittany Forsyth, Chief Talent Officer at Shopify, spoke to Shopify’s policy for their employees of working “Digital by Default” early in 2020 to allow all team members to work remotely indefinitely moving forward.</p>



<p>“Working remotely had some challenges but it democratized interactions,” said Salopek. “Every participant and speaker and the same amount of voice and space, which made their all-hands meetings more engaging and collaborative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel, however, stressed the importance of gathering the right data –&nbsp;only this way can you identify and leverage the advantages presented by a digital-first work culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You need to have access to the right data in order to analyze it and make informed decisions,” said Serena Huang, Head of Global People Analytics at Kraft Heinz. “That is the starting point to know where you’re starting from and then you can understand what skills you need.”<br></p>



<h2>Know the Skills Already On Your Team</h2>



<p>More than ever, companies are now required to innovate to meet changing customer needs at the right time, and to deliver the right solutions.</p>



<p>Tim Brown, VP of Talent at Peloton, learned the importance of pressure-testing their own infrastructure after Peloton saw such hyper-growth in 2020 that it strained their existing supply chain. They now are able to find where their limitations are within the existing structure, and how to then overcome those limitations.</p>



<p>“You need to be able to get the right data as [your organization] continues to grow,” said Brown. “You could have 10 great Engineers, but if you don’t have a good Designer, all the work the Engineers did won’t translate to your customer.”</p>



<p>BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey shows that a key trend among respondents was that they felt their organization would be more successful with more data skills. What many companies fail to recognize, however, is that they often already have the skill sets they’re hiring for within their organization in unsuspecting positions.</p>



<p>Most companies can’t answer simple questions like how many people know Python really well. They may know how many Data Scientists they have; but your best Python knowledge-holder may work in finance,” Huang noted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know the scale of abilities already within your teams, you can create meaningful employee engagement opportunities by pairing a person’s skill set with their unique professional development goals. You can also look past technical competencies to find other ways that employees can add value to their team, including what Huang called ‘leadership skills,’ or soft skills, that are often developed in previous experiences.</p>



<p>“Learning agility seems to be an indicator of success compared to most other skills,” said Salopek. “The ability to step out of your comfort zone to try something new, and having the confidence to fail is a sought after skill to support digital transformation, especially for existing and emerging leaders.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Learn Today to Lead Tomorrow</h2>



<p>75 percent of executives who responded to the survey said they believe digital skills training would make them more successful.</p>



<p>Susan Justus, Senior Director and Head of Talent Development at Betterment, has been piloting a number of initiatives using design thinking that are geared towards emerging leaders and managers to keep learning.</p>



<p>“We believe in knowledge sharing,” said Justus.“We had the data analytics team present to other teams on how to better work with data analytics as not everyone thinks from an analytics mindset.”</p>



<p>Looking inward to create these learning opportunities provides insight for the hiring process when needing to source skills from outside your organization.</p>



<p>“When hiring teams, you have to look at the skills but also the competency,” said Brown. “How long would it take someone to learn the skills versus to bring someone on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huang agreed: “You need to find the right skills before you find the right talent. Be clear on the skills you need for your company to succeed.”</p>



<p>The Digital Skills Survey found that there are a number of emerging roles that can have a big impact on organizational growth, which employees can land by upskilling in key areas. These include: Artificial Intelligence Specialist, Experience Designer, Product Owner, Site Reliability Engineer, Cybersecurity Specialist, and Big Data Developer.</p>



<p>“Anything related and obliquely related to software development, including UX and product design, is going to be in demand for the foreseeable future,” Salopek added.</p>



<p>Marketing and Development are also the two disciplines that organizations are planning to hire the most in 2021, leaving lots of opportunities for those looking to enter the tech sector.</p>



<p>Huang noted that while creating opportunities is good, creating the culture and space for employees to take advantage of the initiatives is imperative. “A lot of people are also struggling to find time to learn because they feel very busy,” she said. “How can learning be part of the workday and to create a culture that motivates learning, and having X percentage of time devoted to failing and learning from it if it doesn&#8217;t succeed.”</p>



<p>Justus added, “A lot of people are experiencing a different challenge with their home or work situation and are looking to find ways to meet people where they are to keep a growth mindset at the forefront.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The one constant the panelists know for sure is to continue expecting the unexpected. </p>



<p>People that develop digital agility and continue future-proofing their skills will be well-positioned for long term success throughout their professional journeys.</p>

<p><strong>Stepping Up: Canada’s Next Digital Chapter </strong>– the final installment in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s 2020 Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on December 3 and featured leaders from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Hootsuite</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>EY,</strong> and <strong>Rogers Communications</strong>.</p>

<p>Canada’s digital landscape has exploded over the past two decades, with home-grown companies claiming their rightful place on the world stage. Meanwhile, global companies continue to tap into Canada’s unique ecosystem of highly qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>We spoke with technology experts from <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Hootsuite</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>EY,</strong> and <strong>Rogers Communications</strong> to share insights about what makes Canada a place for thriving business, and what Canada can do to continue fostering homegrown talent.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Pivot From Resources to Resourcefulness&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Elana Chan, Head of B2B Marketing at Google agrees with the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, that Canada is shifting from a resource-based economy, to a resourcefulness based economy.</p>



<p>More than 97 percent of the Canadian economy is made up of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMB), making them the backbone of the economy today. The ability for SMBs to become more digitally savvy with search engine optimization and social media will become essential to reach an international audience and continue growing.</p>



<p>“Fewer than 10 percent of our SMB export. Yet we know that those that do grow two times faster than others,” said Chan.</p>



<p>Chan continued, “We&#8217;re one of the only G7 countries with trade agreements with all the other G7 countries. So we have all the conditions to export more Canadian goods.”</p>



<p>Adapting to the given circumstances and pursuing new opportunities is a resilience woven deep into the Canadian identity. This is continuously tested as large firms pivot to stay connected and relevant in the minds of consumers.</p>



<p>“Competition is coming from everywhere, even from non-traditional competitors with the big tech firms entering into non-traditional sectors that they weren&#8217;t originally playing in, like financial services. Legacy brands are now finding ways to go direct-to-consumer rather than playing the B2B game,” said Stephen Megitt, Executive Strategy Director at EY.</p>



<p>Despite the evolving strategies from the heavily resourced firms, Megitt sees Canada’s big opportunity to stave off competition coming from entrepreneurial pursuits. “There&#8217;s a lot of small tech startups that are now competing against larger ones. This is primarily fuelled by a strong entrepreneurial environment within Canada.”</p>



<p>Jon de la Mothe, Vice President, Ad Product and Operations for Rogers Communications, has seen the technological transformations Canada has undergone over the past decades. When assessing Canada’s current position against international competitors, “We&#8217;re not playing catch up anymore,” he said.</p>



<p>Tom Keiser, CEO at Hootsuite embraces the disruption that is on the horizon. “We&#8217;re the dominant players. Some of [the panelist companies] are in dominant positions, and have been now for over a decade and we are going to get disrupted. Just like we&#8217;ve been disrupting those before us. The acceleration of disruption with the acceleration of technologies is going to be the norm.”</p>



<p>“We should probably all stop calling it digital transformation and just call it transformation or business transformation,” said Megitt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations are making investments into technology and bringing experiences to life in a matter of weeks that previously would have taken months or years to complete. This requires a workforce and culture with significant agility to tackle the challenge of a compressed innovation cycle, and the opportunity that it can offer.</p>



<p>Leanne Gibson, Head of Industry at Facebook &amp; Instagram Canada said, “We see an urgent imperative for brands to accelerate the pace of e-commerce adoption in Canada and frankly, around the world. With that, skills are required.”</p>



<p>“Every company now is a digital company,” said Chan. “That&#8217;s the only way to succeed, and digital skills are going to be the rising tide that raises all ships.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Raise Your Hand to Reskill</h2>



<p>As industries shift, there is a growing disconnect between available skills and available positions.</p>



<p>“We now are fighting for the same talent across industries,” said Megitt. “When you introduce this new context and [way of] doing things, every single company is now looking to have the same set of players on their team that can focus more in design thinking, human centered design, and UX.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Demand is already outstripping supply across product, across design, across engineering in Canada,” said Keiser. “As the public cloud continues to evolve and really everything becomes digitized and digital products, the demand for being able to bring that cohesively together into a design and aesthetic that is easy, navigable and delightful&#8230;only becomes more and more important. Having that foundational set of skills becomes more important than ever for the success of anyone working in the digital space.”</p>



<p>Chan sees Canada’s success over the next 10 years linked to how well we retrain existing workers, “I don&#8217;t think we can leave people behind here. The digital divide is going to be really real and problematic if we cannot have basic digital skills for a wider population.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For professionals mid-career, changing track and learning new digital skills can be destabilizing. Chan, however, believes that you should not discount your current skill set. Rather, lean into your experience and transferable skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in tech for a while, and there are a lot of transversal skills that we&#8217;re looking for, that people in more traditional, quote unquote, industries have,&#8221; Chan said, adding that you sometimes just have to take a risk. &#8220;You have to make the jump, which is a little bit scary because it&#8217;s unknown. But a lot of these traditional companies hire very smart people. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking for [in tech].&#8221;</p>



<p>De la Mothe championed the proactive people that saw their roles evolve from where they started 20 years ago. “The folks that started first to begin that upskilling, cross-skilling are the ones that raised their hands and wanted to learn.”</p>



<p>Megitt sees the global value that Canadian talent offers, but that it will take foresight from Canadian-based companies to create the right kind of environment to keep talent invested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Companies all over the world are looking to grab talent from anywhere, because that&#8217;s the way that we work now.” He continued, “We as Canadians have to create the right short-term and long-term opportunities to help keep the talent here and keep introducing and innovating new technology, new products within those experiences.”</p>



<p>Fostering tech talent goes beyond the current pool of potential workers, Megitt sees the need for collaboration between social institutional structures like education and government to prepare emerging talent for the job market that has yet to be created.</p>



<p>“It can’t start when they get a job. It needs to start early on in life to expose them to STEM and to expose them to careers that they thought weren’t for them. We need to work with [academia and] the government more to create incentives and programs that will train and nurture tech talent, and give them a reason beyond just the job to stay [in Canada] and continue to work and develop the fabric of Canadians.”&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Adapt Alongside Users and Employees</h2>



<p>With human-centred experiences being emphasized in almost every industry, Megitt notes that offering opportunities to lift others up is a strength that companies should be leveraging to create a more well-adapted, strengthened workforce.</p>



<p>“When everyone has opportunities to contribute and you have a diverse perspective and you have a diverse workforce, you&#8217;re going to generate great quality products and experiences.”</p>



<p>Chan said, “As we grow, as we&#8217;re getting more Canadian talent and we&#8217;re reskilling, I think we have to really be thoughtful of great representation across the board.”</p>



<p>“[Canadians] are all really proud of our multicultural society that we live in. At Google, we think about how important it is to be representative of our users. You can&#8217;t be representative of your users if your teams and values aren&#8217;t also reflecting those views,” she continued.</p>



<p>Keiser spoke to how brands and organizations need to assess their values and to actively reflect them through all experiences as consumers become more value-focused. “They are really thinking about who they want to do business with. They want to do business with entities that they&#8217;re aligned with on values.”</p>



<p>Megitt referred to Michael Bierut’s definition of a brand as not something a company creates; rather, it is created by the people that give the brand meaning. “How a consumer interacts with a brand is the meaning that is going to be associated with that brand. So ultimately, experience becomes brand. How [your company] goes about creating those experiences for your customers or for your employees will ultimately ascribe the value to the brand that you have.”</p>



<p>Social media has become a common method to connect brand and identity in order to build the one-to-one relationship and engage with their customers. In a year that has been dominated by change, Keiser advised that social listening is a skill all leaders need to utilize and continuously develop.</p>



<p>“We&#8217;ve seen a lot of big brands and companies make tremendous missteps by not listening and trying to dominate a conversation as opposed to really listening and participating in a conversation.”</p>



<p>“If we all put ourselves in the consumer&#8217;s shoes, we know our expectations are higher than they&#8217;ve ever been and that is not going to change, said Gibson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timely information has never been more relevant than in the digital age and the explosion of ecommerce. Companies are expected to be constantly in tune to the customer needs and deliver personalized, immediate experiences to the consumer.</p>



<p>“Consumers expect all brands to be omnichannel and to have a frictionless commerce experience wherever they go,” she added. “If they don&#8217;t get it, they will leave.” Despite this expectation, only 40 percent of Canadian businesses have an ecommerce website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With many opportunities being left on the table, businesses should be designing experiences with data-driven decisions and leveraging technology in a much better way.</p>



<p>“Customer expectations have evolved, employee expectations and evolved,” added Megitt. “Our context for everything that we used to do is now different. We may never get back to normal and we certainly can never go back to normal digital operations either.”<br></p>



<h2>Invest in Canada’s Future by Investing in Yourself</h2>



<p>What does all the evolution mean for the digital future of Canadian businesses and talent?</p>



<p>Companies looking for growth opportunities should be looking for talent that are in the pursuit of growth, and creating spaces that motivate them to thrive.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s hard to see where and how some of this disruption is going to take place. But it&#8217;s happening right now,” said Keiser. “It&#8217;s this continual acceleration of disruption and creating new and interesting opportunities and really every space that we&#8217;re where we do business in.”</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re learning about better ways of working and we&#8217;re learning about psychological safety and making sure people have what they need to actually be successful in this environment,” said Megitt.</p>



<p>One big decision individuals should be considering is how they are spending their time, and what can be invested today to earn sought-after rewards tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gibson advised that it is up to the individual to take advantage of the available options. “If you&#8217;re that curious person who prioritizes leaning in and being on a learning journey your entire career, the opportunities are really endless.”</p>



<p>Chan said, “The passion and the energy that you&#8217;re bringing to the table plus your talent is a really powerful combination. If you are leaning into your superpowers, you can help people overlook a lot of your gaps.” She continued, “Everyone here is talking about they&#8217;re looking for talent. [Companies are] looking for good people. They&#8217;re looking for very smart people who want to learn and grow and do better and solve interesting problems.”</p>



<p>Megitt championed the Canadian stereotype of a perceived politesse around the globe as a superpower in itself. “I love that stereotype because I think we are [nice]. We take care of each other and we take care of our own&#8230;Being nice will never mean that we finished last.”</p>

<p><strong>How Digital Marketing Built These Brands</strong> – the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on November 19 and featured leaders from <strong>Wave</strong>,<strong> Updater</strong>, and<strong> Better.com</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>

<iframe title="How Digital Marketing Built These Brands" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/481468222?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re working on a new business or an established brand, digital marketing is now more essential than ever for continued growth. If you’re able to harness its powers and capabilities, you’ll be able to have long term gain over short term glamour.</p>



<p>We spoke with marketing experts from <strong>Wave</strong>, <strong>Updater</strong>, and <strong>Better.com</strong> to share their tips for identifying customers and growing your business, using the power of digital marketing and the plethora of digital strategies now available.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Leverage Free or Low Cost Tools</h2>



<p>Knowing where to invest your resources is a crucial step in your company’s growth, especially for new brands and entrepreneurs. One unanimous piece of advice for entrepreneurs from our panelists is to explore your options when it comes to identifying and defining your marketing and competitors.</p>



<p>Melanie Dodge, Director of Marketing at Better.com, recommends using low-cost tools to understand the search behaviors of your customers and the interests and needs of your leads.</p>



<p>“Your customers are your best tools. They will tell you what they&#8217;re thinking and that can also inform strategy,” says Dodge, adding that conducting surveys and tracking the search patterns of your customers and competitors are great places to start.</p>



<p>Being aware of your competitors is essential, particularly when it comes to something like developing bidding strategies –&nbsp;they may have access to significantly larger budgets. Jenna Weinerman, VP of Marketing at Updater offers a cost-effective tip.</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re marketing, you don&#8217;t have to bid or advertise. You can create content to answer the questions of what they&#8217;re searching for,” Weinerman says. “Say something relevant and powerful,” as a creative solution for smart search spending on a small budget.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Invest In SEO (and be Patient)</h2>



<p>The ability to put the right content in front of the right eyes at the right time is what makes Search Engine Optimization (SEO) a go-to tool for digital marketers.</p>



<p>“SEO is something that we&#8217;ve really doubled down on and I&#8217;m a really big believer in not just ranking for the traffic, but actually adding something of value,” says Dodge.</p>



<p>Sarah Bugeja, Director of Demand Generation at Wave, agrees, explaining that SEO needs to complement your content strategy. “It is incredibly important from an organic point of view to build meaningful content that serves the needs of what people are looking for and anchoring it also with brand friendly content.”</p>



<p>Bugeja also notes that in order to see success with SEO, get comfortable with playing the long game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is not something you do today and you&#8217;re going to see amazing results tomorrow. There is some patience to be had, especially depending on the vertical that you&#8217;re playing in&#8230;and it may take you longer to index, meaning to show up higher [in organic search results],” says Bugeja.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Use Content to Build Your Brand</h2>



<p>In our previous Digital Leadership Event Series panel, <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/the-new-rules-of-marketing-creating-stand-out-content">The New Rules of Marketing: Creating Stand-Out Content</a>, maximizing your content was a key takeaway. When you have limited access to tools or tricks for new content creation, investing in larger pieces with dynamic content that can be divided and delivered across several platforms is a smart use of resources, rather than speeding through several, smaller, specific pieces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Spend the extra time to actually add value and go past getting the traffic there. So whether it&#8217;s putting a visual in an animation and video, recycle and make your content work for you. Don&#8217;t do double the job,” says Dodge, recommending&nbsp; a more scientific approach to measurement, not only for top of funnel metrics, but when looking at the trickle down effect of your marketing initiatives.</p>



<p>“Maybe a [Call to Action] or an ad is driving a lot of clicks and orders, but is it ultimately driving to that conversion goal?”</p>



<p>Informed consumers look for quality content to build their long term brand loyalty, but advocating for it while balancing quarterly targets can be a challenge when speaking with different stakeholders and connecting content strategy to the overall organizational goals.</p>



<p>“You need proof points,” says Weinerman. Qualitative measurements such as surveys, customer comments, public relations, and articles are strong points to build an arsenal that can pay off in the long run in building brand credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you&#8217;re in it for the quick win in B2B, it&#8217;s really easy to be forgotten. So I tend to put more emphasis on the brand because I want to build a really memorable brand experience for our clients rather than one conversion at a time, because they&#8217;re not going to be with us for that one conversion. That&#8217;s the beginning of their journey with us,” says Weinerman.</p>



<p>Long-term relationship building requires showing your customers consistent value and adding features that can make their lives easier throughout their life cycle with your organization. In order to maximize your efforts, collaborating with people from different teams can align company goals, and generate multi-platform solutions.</p>



<h2>Leverage Cross-Functional Teams </h2>



<p>Working with other departments allows for more actionable, informed insights. Cohesive, cross-functional teams with key players is one way marketers are leveraging internal skill sets to turn key learnings into meaningful performance.</p>



<p>Dodge says that a critical investment Better.com made was hiring a director of Product of Growth and establishing a growth committee made up of their product, marketing, design, and data teams. “Through that we have really established a test-and-learn approach to everything we do when it comes to digital marketing.”</p>



<p>Bugeja credits working with her data team as a key asset to Wave’s marketing strategy. “Working with our data science team to understand campaign performance has really improved our ability to execute on paid search super efficiently when we understand what is actually driving the best kinds of acquisition,” she says, adding that one final piece of advice for new businesses and entrepreneurs, “don’t be afraid of the word pivot.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, our experts strive to blend strategies, tools, and teams that will work together to convert outstanding, long-lasting customers. By integrating the measurable and meaningful content, businesses will often see cost-effective, sustained performance growth.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Brick &amp; Mortar to Click &amp; Order: Retail Experience in 2021</strong> – the first instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series –&nbsp; took place on January 21 and featured leaders from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;">
<figure class="wp-block-embed-vimeo aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/503248993?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left">2020 was a year that transformed retail, forcing brands to reconsider and re-invest in the way they market and sell their products among increased online competition.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Many top brands are now offering faster shipping and one-click checkout for seamless UX, as well as AR/VR experiences that allow customers to “touch-and-feel” their preferred products. There has also been an increased focus on omni-channel selling, most notably on social media, with a record of $23.3 billion in social commerce sales expected by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">We spoke with digital marketing and product experts from <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Chipotle</strong>, and <strong>General Mills</strong> to share insights on how they’ve adapted their in-person and online shopping experiences for customers, and the trends and channels have been most successful in preparing for the future.<br></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Invest in Ideas Early</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the rapid pace of innovation over the course of the year, some brands had to play catch up to pivot their offerings to fit the digital landscape. Many of the brands that saw success during these uncertain times were ones that were already investing in digital channels and opportunities.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Jonathon Relkin, Director of Off-Premise at Chipotle, credited his team for being an early adopter of emerging tech, from third-party partnerships to Tik Tok. “We were laying the foundation prior to all of this happening,” he said. “We invested in a digital flow from what the customer sees to the back of house operations.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Relkin also saw a swift change in where their revenue was coming from, “20 percent of revenue was coming from digital before. In the height of Corona it went as high as 70 percent. Now we’re averaging at 50 percent and we’re able to lean into it because of the work and investments made to have digital success.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Daniella Bellaire, Head of Global Revenue Enablement and Shopify, noted that whenever changes appear, reducing barriers of adoption across the board is a good place to start.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Retailers are more adaptable than people thought,” she said. Shopify partnered with the Government of Canada to create a Go Digital Canada initiative to help entrepreneurs start up their businesses during this time.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Make Data-Driven Decisions&nbsp;</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">For a Consumer Packaging Goods (CPG) company like General Mills, change can be slow as annual cycles have been used for decades. The company, however, has been able to navigate these tricky times by optimizing existing strategies and attempting to automate as many processes as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Our motto for our omnichannel is ‘to show up brilliantly’,” said Jay Picconatto, Director of Commerce at General Mills. “Our retailers wanted quality content across platforms. Most of our energy has been spent to show up brilliantly on all platforms.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">The company has also focused on director-to-consumer (D2C) shopping, allowing them to gather and analyze relevant data on their customers, brand, and operational partners. With this information, they&#8217;ve been able to review the effectiveness of their digital strategy and optimize approaches, processes, and campaigns.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“E-commerce a year ago was less than five percent of our business. Now, it&#8217;s more than double that. We&#8217;ve had to really have a heavy lift on some of those process tools and capabilities, even just ways of working to make sure that we show up brilliantly on our retailers platforms.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Focus on Your Brand Story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Both Relkin and Bellaire agree that having consistent brand storytelling across your channels is important to a consumer to buy-into the ethos of your brand, to then buy your products. This means investing in your digital infrastructure and leveraging the resources available to you.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“We fundamentally believe we can change the world one burrito at a time,” said Relkin. “We look at our digital ecosystem and the channels that we show up on and really think about who&#8217;s there, why are they there, what are they interested in, and how do we engage in that conversation as a brand.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“The reality is digital affords us an ability to do storytelling and probably a better way than than a traditional grocery store does,” said Picconatto. “It allows us to provide solutions in a way that we never could figure out in store. For example, we can even bundle things in different parts of the store online.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Picconatto points to an example how his digital team jumped on a Barbie cake trend that allowed them to sell dolls alongside their Betty Crocker cake mixes. “We could never pull that off in-store,” he said.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Integrate Digital and Analog Experiences</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">With the adoption of digital platforms and e-commerce, delivering a great user experience is now practically mandatory for success in today’s market. While retailers are looking to create and innovate their digital experiences, our panelists also remind brands to invest in their physical spaces as well, and to rethink how they could be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“User experience is really at the forefront of the digital experience and the online shopping experience. Making sure it’s easy to put things into a cart, and that it’s easy to check out,” said Bellaire.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Most of the growth online is still being fulfilled in store,” said Picconatto. “When you think about click and collect models for grocery performance, for example.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Stores are working with band-aids right now with having fulfillment warehouses bolted onto the buildings or just sitting in the front of the store. You need to think through the total product offering needed to make [the pick up experience] easier.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">“Convenience will prevail,” said Bellaire. “But if there’s a unique experience involved, I will show up and I will buy in-person because I want to support my community.”</p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Ultimately, humans love tangible experiences and value convenience. With the retail changes that will continue to unfold, the potential for a new symbiotic relationship between in-store activities and digital conveniences to augment each other to a holistic consumer experience leaves lots of room for entrepreneurs and businesses to find their unique place in this evolving landscape.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out more about the sales industry and where it’s headed, BrainStation hosted a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/event/futureofsales-toronto-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future of Sales panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> featuring experts from leading technology companies, including LinkedIn, Shopify, and Eighty-Eight. Our panelists talked about how the industry is changing, the unique challenges it’s facing, and what it takes to be successful in sales. </span></p>
<h3><b>Sales Challenges in 2019</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology poses new challenges for sales teams, as buyers are increasingly knowledgeable about products and services through online research and reviews – before ever speaking to a salesperson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With all the information out there, buyers are really educated,” said Eric Demille, Sales Leader at Shopify Plus. “As a salesperson, you really have to differentiate yourself and sell the value that your solution is going to provide.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Fatima Zaidi, VP of Business Development at Eighty-Eight and Co-founder and CEO of Quill, differentiation is key in a market where buyers have no shortage of options available to them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you stand out from your competition and find your unique selling proposition? What are you doing differently from all the other competitors out there?” asks Zaidi. “To overcome these challenges, I don’t rely solely on outbound outreach. I rely on my personal brand, networking events, and building strong long-lasting relationships.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Building Trust as a salesperson</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kalsang Tanzin, Regional Manager, Mid Market Sales Solutions at LinkedIn, emphasized that building trust is now crucial, as it is an unfortunate yet common perception that salespeople aren’t trustworthy. “77 percent of buyers said that they don’t think sales reps know anything about their business and aren’t in a position to help,” said Tanzin, quoting a <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/14-09-29-why_dont_buyers_want_to_meet_with_your_salespeople/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forrester article</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way the sales profession is portrayed, whether it be on television or in the corporate world, doesn’t help when a salesperson is trying to build trust with their client. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest challenge is the way sales is perceived. It’s perceived as a slimy profession, which it’s not. The sales profession is a human interaction,” said Demille. “We always say, we need to work to earn [a client’s] business over and over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zaidi put it best:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best way to be a salesperson is to not be a salesperson, and to build trust.”</span></p>
<h3><b>What it Takes to be Successful in Sales</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know sales is important, and yet there is so little formal education or training that prepares aspiring sales professionals for the role. We asked our panelists what it takes to be a good salesperson, and what they look for in a candidate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A demonstrated ability to be curious and to learn is a must have,” said Tanzin. “What makes you successful? Your attitude, your aptitude, and your experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve often found that the most unexpected people have surprised me with their ability to hustle and to be resourceful,” said Zaidi. “I usually go with my gut and hire for a personality type, but I like giving new salespeople a chance because you never know who’s going to surprise you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sales, it’s not always about your existing skills, but rather your ability and willingness to work hard and to learn quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like salespeople who can demonstrate getting better every day,” said Demille. “You can’t train someone to be curious or self-aware. It’s a strength to know what you’re not good at.”</span></p>
<h3><b>How to Start a Sales Career</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our panelists provided insightful advice for both aspiring sales professionals, and anyone looking to get better at their profession. If you’re looking to pursue sales, this advice is for you: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t take rejection personally, and approach your sales quota analytically,” said Zaidi. “Be resilient and bounce back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demille’s advice was simple. “Never stop learning. You need to work on it, you’re not going to be good at it the first time around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The heart of sales is about understanding relationships, understanding who that person is and what matters to them,” said Tanzin. “Care about people.”</span></p>

<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4485 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM-1024x636.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-17 at 11.17.50 AM" width="800" height="497" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM-1024x636.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM-300x186.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM-768x477.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM-960x596.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-11.17.50-AM.png 1708w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>First things first, what is digital advocacy? People call it many things: influencer marketing, brand ambassador programs, word of mouth marketing. VEGA calls it <em>Digital Advocacy</em> and defines it as &#8220;marketing that aims at specific key individuals as opposed to demographically based categories.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s why you should be interested in influencer marketing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s the fastest growing online marketing channel</li>
<li>75% of marketers currently use influencer marketing</li>
<li>59% of marcomm professionals plan to use influencer marketing in 2016</li>
<li>52% of brands have stand-alone budgets for sponsored social content</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4494 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM-1024x519.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-17 at 12.32.20 PM" width="800" height="405" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM-1024x519.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM-300x152.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM-768x389.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM-960x486.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-17-at-12.32.20-PM.png 1642w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits? Digital Advocacy can help you to build brand awareness, educate your community about your brand, boost your social following.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The power of referral:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>60% of new product trail comes from referrals.</li>
<li>95% of consumers trust recommendations from others, even people they don&#8217;t know, over branded content.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to build a Digital Advocacy Program:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a tailored approach to building real relationships with influencers</li>
<li>Set goals &amp; KPIs</li>
<li>Find your target consumer</li>
<li>Know what you&#8217;re asking for: how much time is required by you and by them</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some considerations on Paid vs. Earned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure real relationships come first</li>
<li>Look at opportunities before cost</li>
<li>You get what you pay for</li>
<li>Pay someone, but only if it&#8217;s part of a bigger relationship opportunity</li>
</ul>
