								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The stories of managing a work-life balance during a pandemic are plentiful and profound. The challenge of balancing ever-changing priorities is only magnified in the lives of parents raising young children.&nbsp;We wanted to take a moment to recognize the amazing parents pivoting their careers during a pandemic and graduated from a <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses">BrainStation Online Bootcamp</a>; a feat that shouldn’t go unnoticed.</p>



<p>They’ve continued to go above and beyond and have shared their experiences, with advice for fellow parents who are thinking about learning new skills and changing their careers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why Start a New Challenge?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many reasons why parents may decide to take on a bootcamp. For some, losing a job during a pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to tackle something new and earn a new career. Others saw their growing family as the spark they needed to make a career transition.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JS0d1EMh8enZ2FHOhkjNWnMQUsugGgMokakbN3bpbqqKtklwLn9xHUcdpTZGgxIxCYvEzR-bnkWN8xuhKAM1qAoycMBw0jukBPpEgM8Khw7XT1xPC5A5JHCeHgWmsacfN1ozlxMy" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development</a> graduate Jessica Kwok started the bootcamp with a background in Kinesiology and saw maternity leave as the perfect time to jump into a new career. She shared that finding remote learning was a big factor. “As a new mom, being able to do the bootcamp remotely was a major priority for me,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ultimately chose BrainStation because they were well versed in delivering content online (even before Covid!) and had an impressive growing alumni network.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elyse Renouf has a background in business consulting and recently graduated from our <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp">Data Science Bootcamp</a>. She shared that Covid-19 layoffs, daycare closures, and a desire for a more technical role that could be remote was the perfect storm to spur the need for a change and take on a course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tight and Tricky Schedules</h2>



<p>So what does studying while being a parent look like? Think packed schedules, lots of help from friends and family, and getting creative with distracting little ones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12735" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-300x258.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-768x661.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1536x1322.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-960x827.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Angus Ryer, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development </a>Graduate with a history in construction, shared his schedule:</p>



<ul><li>Wake up to my nine-month old crying</li><li>Go wake up my three-year old</li><li>Get breakfast ready, eat together, take the boys out for a walk while my wife works out</li><li>Make coffee number two</li><li>Hop online for class at 10:30 am</li><li>Listen intently and work on projects until 1 pm</li><li>Help my older boy get settled into a nap</li><li>Power through classes from 2:00 pm to 6:30 pm&nbsp;</li><li>Spend some time with my kids, eat dinner (made with love by my wife), and then settle my older one into bed</li><li>&#8220;Relax&#8221; on the couch with my wife, half-distracted by MasterChef Australia or InkMasters while I continued to study work in the concepts I had learned</li><li>Rinse and repeat!</li></ul>



<p>Other parents shared similar busy schedules, commenting that despite the lack of personal time, it was all worth it to have a brand new bootcamp credentials in only three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s scary. That&#8217;s natural. The biggest rewards usually come from the biggest risks,” said Armando Pastorin, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">UX Design Bootcamp</a> Graduate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This process is mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting for everyone,” Renouf admits. With the mix of parenting and household responsibilities while studying, it can be tempting to doubt your decision or want to quit. Luckily, her son helped provide the motivation she needed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12737" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-300x160.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-768x408.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1536x817.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-960x510.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“I did this course and am making this career change so I can get to see him more so despite how overwhelming it was at the time, I truly believe it was all worth it.”</p>



<h2>Advice for Parents Going Back to School&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Each parent was keen to share advice for other parents looking to learn remotely. Here are some of our favorite tips:</p>



<p>“Surround yourself with people who can encourage and support you along the way. As much as we&#8217;d all like to be the &#8220;super-mom&#8221; or &#8220;super-dad&#8221; who single handedly got through a bootcamp while watching your child full time, having people who can help you out and root for you is extremely valuable to your success.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<p>“Take help where needed from your family, friends or whoever you like to get some quiet time to finish your work. During my Coffee and Conversation sessions, I came across a lot of parents from different cohorts, with whom I would exchange ideas on time management and so much more which helped me a lot. &#8221; &#8211; Bonney Halani</p>



<p>“Set a schedule leading up to the program and help your kids get into that routine, so that they expect you to be focused at specific times. Kids (and grown-ups) tend to go crazy if they don&#8217;t get enough attention, so by committing to giving them the right amount of time, it&#8217;s easier to give yourself periods of focus without the kids tugging at your pant legs.” &#8211; Angus Ryer</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any sitters, no family, and at first, no daycare, and it was madness. If you can, identify where you can make your life a little smoother by either meal prepping, freezing leftovers, or ordering take out to save time. Keep snacks on your desk and relax your screen time rules (a good tablet/headphones really are your best friend in survival mode.&#8221; &#8211; Elyse Renouf</p>



<p>“Block off dedicated family time and actually stick to it.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12738" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-768x606.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-960x757.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Photo Credit: Sammie Chan (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=en">@sammiechn</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>



<p>For parents deciding to use their extra time to upskill, taking some ‘me time’ is all the more important. Pastorin did this by dedicating one evening of the week to himself. “Every Tuesday evening was my time to go out and refresh the brain with something completely unrelated to work.”<br></p>



<p>Kwok started a workout group, initiated a Zoom workout group with a few friends to keep each other accountable for a 30-minute workout, three times a week.</p>



<p>Whatever shape your ‘me time’ takes, don’t put it on the back burner! Even super parents need a break.</p>



<h2>What Comes Next</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the specific needs of a person’s demanding day-to-day are different for everyone. But these incredible parents are proof that if you are determined, committed, and perhaps a little crafty, you can achieve your goals with your family and future in mind.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Founder of Rally, Matthew Mayers, shares how his BrainStation experience bolstered his design-first entrepreneurial spirit and boosted his career in tech.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite earning a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Matthew Mayers knew he wanted to be in the tech industry. So after a few years of side-hustles and working as an Engineer, he applied for the UX Design Diploma Program BrainStation.</p>



<p>We spoke with Mayers about his foray into tech, how the BrainStation experience bolstered his entrepreneurial spirit, and what it’s like to be a Co-Founder of <a href="http://rallylegal.com">Rally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QBmeKrma43aIW_iTtUtPkkL_2NvVDnz3yNw6dJSMvRR8VSFIWeRpBrZbOdySXc31vLk26x22C0AC6RglTFMYzulWoRzDD6qFEOwTxd6JVrTn97sjsEQvDctRCYlFz_m0O4drLV99" alt="Picture of founder, Matthew Mayers."/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>What does a typical day look like for you as a Co-Founder of Rally?</strong></h2>



<p>Every day is different and that&#8217;s why I love my job. As a Co-Founder, my responsibilities range from product design, to customer success, to accounting, to recruitment, to development. Some days are filled with meetings, others are quiet and focused. I start every day by asking myself, &#8220;What set of actions can I take today to add the most value for my company and team?&#8221; Sometimes that means weighing in on a high-stakes product discussion, other times it means running to the post office to buy stamps.</p>



<h2><strong>How did the idea for Rally first come about? What problem does it aim to solve?</strong></h2>



<p>Shortly after completing my <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">program at BrainStation</a>, I was approached by my co-founder Daniel Di Maria (a fellow BrainStation graduate) with an idea. Based on his previous experience as a lawyer, he believed that there were many opportunities to drive improvement within the legal industry. He envisioned a world in which entrepreneurs could affordably manage the legal state of their companies in a streamlined, digital fashion. Automation could be used to help their lawyers and paralegals get work done faster, more accurately, and more enjoyably.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/v40S_ioFWgO9MZfphotq3mkZEChMuDDdwVB3iUJm3JfVTap6D1JSD0pUJGYIsmPW56cl8DqIlYjXdrh8wx8HtcfA-F8Ze9xbP_X36-7gpcfWsIYOn9X89MqQxBdP5wQhuU0wegmN" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<p>Having already experienced my first shot at entrepreneurship, the idea immediately resonated as I had struggled to find affordable legal services. I ended up doing much of my legal work myself and incorrectly.</p>



<p>We soon met our other Co-Founder, Scott Stevenson, who was serendipitously developing a similar concept. Now, three years in, our ideas have grown and evolved but we still aim to solve the same problems – legal services remain too expensive, inefficient, and inaccessible.</p>



<h2><strong>What has been the response you’ve received for Rally?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Legal service providers are feeling a tremendous amount of pressure (especially in a post-COVID world) to adopt technology which enables legal work to be done better and more affordably. Purchasers of legal services are fed up with the antiquated ways of operating and are pleading with their providers to catch up with the modern, digital world. <br><br>More and more forward-thinking service providers are approaching us with a desire to provide a better client-experience and it&#8217;s highly rewarding to be equipping these drivers of positive change. We sincerely believe that this is just the beginning for the legal industry. Massive transformations will be demonstrated in the coming years and we look forward to doing our small part to help.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hrqDeEeVqEgSaOI6czqkfTA0vT6wrdnyghoE3T8btZmHsxK5sLvPc5t36R8rcbxn5a9UHm-W6hPxVcBpIl2aE9H8zq01bOCIgY6iir2AuBSqMxU0ZLs-zrrG0HeEdeOpidvgSLIO" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<h2><strong>What made you decide to apply to the User Experience Diploma Program?</strong></h2>



<p>I have always been deeply fascinated by the intersection of human behavior and technology. User experience design is so much more than the selection of fonts and colours. Digital design has the power to alter how people see themselves, interact with each other, and engage with the world around them. Through BrainStation, I aimed to achieve a deeper understanding of how to harness this power. I wanted to develop both my creativity and technical acumen to improve people&#8217;s lives through innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How did the skills you learned at BrainStation contribute to how you designed your product?</strong></h2>



<p>At BrainStation, I learned how to take a step back and ask the right questions before starting to build. Who are we building for? What are their biggest pain-points? Where are the greatest opportunities to improve people&#8217;s workflows? What do they want, not just from products but from their lives? What do they need?</p>



<p>We spent several months speaking with potential customers, asking these questions and iterating on mockups before writing a single line of code. We have since developed a design-first culture and answering the &#8216;why&#8217; always comes before the &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;how.&#8217; We&#8217;re proud that even our talented development team is involved in the process from the very early stages of design to help ensure we&#8217;re building the right tools for our customers.</p>



<h2><strong>What challenges have you faced in creating a seamless user experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most challenging aspects of designing Rally is accounting for multiple, distinct user types, each with their own unique goals and behavior. While our customers are legal service providers, they use Rally as their client-facing interface. It&#8217;s a two-sided product – similar to a marketplace with buyers and sellers. Accommodating the various “jobs-to-be-done” of each persona while providing a frictionless, unified experience necessitates working relentlessly with our customers and their clients to continuously gather insights. <br><br>Every Designer learns about the value of customer feedback but sorting, filtering, and prioritizing insights is a highly nuanced and ever-evolving process.</p>



<h2><strong>What was a highlight of your BrainStation learning experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While learning the core executional skills of UX Design was one of the best educational experiences of my life, I particularly enjoyed the group discussions focused on the philosophy and ethics of design. Thanks to my instructors, Alex Chong and Brad MacDonald, there were many opportunities to dive into the rich, existential questions of what it means to design. These conversations forever changed my understanding of how the application of science through technology impacts humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_U60H4P8p6Y9Gj-CfoFxbMwMtfUoutUUXwzI27cjaNDTHGqEtWzhbH8A1ufmZR8vDTtTH6qZkdKbZ-XVImw4SawX6-yqJ5EcnjHEuIC-8NMEhmoS23FBchrCFLGNquQNrMgiLvha" alt="Group of young students gathered around a computer in class."/></figure>



<h2><strong>You hired Tiffany Chan, a fellow BrainStation graduate. How did you connect?</strong></h2>



<p>We did! We recently had the opportunity to recruit for an entry-level position and couldn&#8217;t think of a better place to look than the bootcamp ecosystem. We got in touch with Michael Bennett, BrainStation&#8217;s Career Success Manager, who connected us with Tiffany. With her experience both as a student in the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development program</a> and then as a TA, she was able to hit the ground running at Rally from her first day. Our team is now almost half BrainStation graduates!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What would you say are some essential digital skills needed to succeed in business?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The single most essential digital skill I would suggest for anyone in the tech industry is developing a foundational understanding of how code works. You don&#8217;t need to become a certified Software Engineer or even gain true proficiency – but you will have a massive advantage knowing a bit about what&#8217;s under the hood to confidently assess feasibility and effort requirements for new functionality. This applies to Designers, Marketers, Product Managers – everyone. Learning the basics of code has made me a much more effective team member even though most of my job doesn&#8217;t require any coding at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What advice would you give to aspiring UX Designers?</strong></h2>



<p>Designing for an idealistic world with rigid processes will only get you so far. In the real world there are technological constraints, market sizing concerns, budgets, and timelines that all need to be considered. Learning to understand everyone else&#8217;s role within a team (such as marketing, finance, development, etc.) and their requirements is as important as designing for the end-user. This is how you move beyond pipe dreams and toward product designs that actually get built and used in real life. By gaining a sense of the big picture and approaching your process with an appropriate level of flexibility, you will find yourself integrating business and technical requirements into your designs at earlier stages.&nbsp;<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BrainStation’s most recent online panel discussion – <strong>Future of Retail: Succeeding in an Online-Only World</strong>&nbsp; – was another rousing success, with thousands of professionals tuning in from around the globe.</p>



<p>As always, Ian Bester, BrainStation’s Vice-President and GM, hosted the panel of retail executives, which included:</p>



<ul><li>Nicole West, VP Digital Strategy and Product at Chipotle Mexican Grill</li><li>Shimona Mehta, Head of EMEA, Shopify Plus</li><li>Deborah Honig, the Head of Nike Direct EMEA West</li></ul>



<p>The panel agreed that the COVID-19 outbreak has increased the speed of digitization, with many of the retailers succeeding now only doubling down on existing digital strategies. </p>



<p>Nicole West, of Chipotle, discussed how the company has in the past worked hard to fuse the digital and in-store experience, asking themselves, “How we can bring the digital experience into our brick and mortar restaurants? Engagement, payments, and rewards –&nbsp;those are the three areas where we can really bring digital to life,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shimona Mehta, of Shopify Plus, added that given the increased demand for online retail, brands have to work hard to create great digital experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;My advice to growing businesses is to be remarkable: think about your brand story and why customers would purchase from you over someone else. You must also create frictionless checkout experience, which includes offering the appropriate payment options, to increase conversion,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel also agreed that a data-driven approach is now fundamental to product roadmaps and marketing decisions, and a greater focus on digital channels will only increase data&#8217;s importance.</p>



<p>&#8220;What most excites me about the future is our chance to serve consumers even better. By getting people engaged in digital platforms, we get to know them better and are able to serve up more personalized content,&#8221; said Deborah Honig of Nike. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year in June, millions of people celebrate Pride Month by proudly waving rainbow flags, attending parades and marches, and recognizing the contributions and struggles of people in the LGBTQA+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Venture Out, a network of community organizations, companies and individuals striving to foster more diversity and inclusivity in the tech sector, giving back and celebrating community successes goes beyond one month each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative launched in 2017. Since then, the team behind it — including 2019 co-chairs Lisa Durnford and Simon Mills — have been creating opportunities for networking, job hunting, and career growth through events by the community, for the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of discussion around how much work we still have to do in terms of diversity and inclusion in the tech sector,” said Durnford. “The founders of Venture Out were realizing when they went to tech networking events or conferences, it was hard to find other folks in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBTQA+ community… but then, at the same time, when they went to Pride events or other events for the community, it often wasn’t very tech-focused.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture Out, she says, was launched to fill that gap.</span></p>
<h2><b>Initiative Connects </b><b>LGBTQA+ Tech Community</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative’s mission, according to Mills, is to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">connect the LGBTQA+ tech community to opportunities, role models, mentors, and each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you’re asking people to have conversations about what they want to do and what they want their career to look like and how to get their first job — how to get their tenth job — you’re implicitly asking for a certain amount of vulnerability or authenticity from folks,” Durnford notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, she says it’s crucial to build spaces where people who often face challenges in being themselves professionally are able to feel like they can have genuine conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the year, the team of volunteers puts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">together conferences, networking opportunities, and connects early-career professionals to new opportunities in the technology and entrepreneurship fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key piece is an annual spring conference in Toronto — the first and largest of its kind in Canada — which Durnford says brought out around 650 people and 40 companies and community partners this year for talks, workshops, networking, and a career fair.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9196" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9196" class="size-large wp-image-9196" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Venture-Out-Lisa-Simon-1024x683.jpg" alt="Venture Out Lisa Simon" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Venture-Out-Lisa-Simon-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Venture-Out-Lisa-Simon-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Venture-Out-Lisa-Simon-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Venture-Out-Lisa-Simon-960x640.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Venture-Out-Lisa-Simon.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9196" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Venture Out</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making all the components happen is a constant challenge, particularly since the volunteer team is made up of a mix of students and people with full-time day jobs, Durnford notes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she says the work it’s totally worth it.</span></p>
<h2><b>‘They’ve Never Been to Events Like This’</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one side of things, Durnford says Venture Out has proven companies are capable of having conversations about being better workplaces for LGBTQA+ employees — unlike a lot of conferences and events where companies are just talking about themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, the workers are gaining new insight and employment connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s through a community that people meet role models and mentors and it’s through community that folks connect with each other and find opportunities,” says Mills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative offers a platform for LGBTQA+ entrepreneurs and leaders within the tech community to tell their stories — and model the way for those who want to be in those positions in the future — he adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why the work matters, both co-chairs say it’s about the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always amazing to hear stories of folks who have found a job through our events or have been able to use our events as a way to kick start conversations about diversity and inclusion within their organizations,” says Mills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What people say is, they’ve never been to events like this, or they’ve never been to a space as safe and welcoming as Venture Out,” Durnford echoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for a lot of people, she adds, it feels like “finally finding a space” designed with them in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve heard from a lot of people that it was a big deal to finally feel comfortable at a tech conference,” Durnford says.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It feels like yesterday, but it’s now been four years since BrainStation started offering digital skills training in Vancouver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that time, we’ve seen the city blossom into a tech giant on the rise: B.C. now has more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">100,000 people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working in the tech sector, representing roughly five percent of its workforce. That’s more than the mining, oil, gas, and forestry industries — combined.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did it get there? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To celebrate our city (and our anniversary), we decided to take a look back.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most important Vancouver tech industry stories from the last four years.  </span></p>
<h2>2015 &#8211; A Maple Syrup Mafia?<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation first started offering part-time courses in Vancouver in 2015. At the time, we operated out of Suite Genius, a co-working space in Mount Pleasant. Dubbed “Mount Pixel,” the area was starting to see a glut of tech companies setting up shop, including Evolve Digital Media, Gener8, Switch United, The Capital, Odyssey Media Inc., and more. In fact, right around that time, Hootsuite announced plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">build a massive tech hub in the area</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6869" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-1.png" alt="Hootsuite tech hub" width="696" height="372" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-1.png 696w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pic-1-300x160.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BC Technology Industry Association (BCTIA) had also just announced the launch of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HyperGrowth,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> B.C.&#8217;s only second-stage revenue accelerator. The HyperGrowth program provides a residency in the BCTIA Innovation Hub, as well as mentorship from Vancouver tech companies like ACL, BuildDirect, and Alacrity Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after, Sony Pictures Imageworks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiled a new 74,000 square-foot headquarters</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Pacific Centre mall, downtown.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6878" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-2.png" alt="Sony Picture Imageworks Vancouver" width="696" height="464" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-2.png 900w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-2-300x200.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Pic-2-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit: Sony Pictures Imageworks</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sony Pictures Imageworks had first opened a production office in the city in 2010, with a staff of 80. With their new office space, though, this number increased to 700 employees in B.C., and they were looking to fill 100 more positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the summer rolled around, a wave of acquisitions hit the local tech scene. First, Intel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they were acquiring Recon, the local makers of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recon Jet<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> smart eyewear. Soon after, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UrtheCast Corp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">., </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a public, Vancouver-based earth observation company, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced that it had acquired Deimos Imaging, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Spanish company that operates a remote sensing system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks later, The Match Group, the global operator of digital dating sites like Tinder and OkCupid, among others, announced it had acquired PlentyOfFish (POF) for a whopping $575 million in cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many ways, the sale of POF was a signal that something in the city had changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Ryan Holmes, the founder of Vancouver-based Hootsuite, had talked about creating a “maple syrup mafia.” Holmes was referencing the so-called PayPal Mafia — PayPal employees who emerged from that company’s sale to Ebay to fund startups like Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Yelp (among others).</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-6915 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/imageedit_3_8260596506.jpg" alt="Hootsuite founder Ryan Holmes" width="697" height="553" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/imageedit_3_8260596506.jpg 697w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/imageedit_3_8260596506-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><br />
<em>Credit: Ryan Holmes, LinkedIn</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The PayPal buyout gave some very young, very ambitious people the confidence to try for another big win and an experienced network to fund them,” Holmes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in Fortune.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He planned to grow “an amazing, billion-dollar-plus company in Vancouver,” so that “when (and if) a liquidation event happens, the HootSuite team will be left with financial resources, network, and a lot of expertise — key ingredients for a Maple Syrup Mafia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sale of POF validated Holmes’ instincts. After all, if Markus Frind, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">POF’s famously </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">work-averse founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">could develop a business worth $575 million, why couldn’t you build a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">billion-dollar </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">company in Vancouver?</span></p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve got tech entrepreneurs. We’ve got tech incubators. We’ve got world-class universities.” — Ryan Holmes, Founder, Hootsuite.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frind clearly believed in the local scene: following the sale of his company, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he invested $9 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Grouplend, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an online lender</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and $18 million in online furniture retailer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cymax Stores Inc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He wasn’t alone. According to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BC Technology Report Card</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the BC Tech Association (and KPMG), early-stage venture capital financing deals increased from just over 100 deals in 2013 to 230 in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the way was Trulioo, global identity verification service, which raised </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million in financing from American Express Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This was the first investment by Amex in a Canadian startup, and the largest technology financing deal of 2015 in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not far off was PHEMI, a software provider for the healthcare industry, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced it had raised a $12.2 million round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of venture financing. The financing was co-led by CTI Life Sciences Fund (CTI) and British Columbia Discovery Fund (Discovery Capital). It also included participation from BDC Capital Healthcare Venture Fund and Yaletown Venture Partners (who we will hear from again). Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiivv</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a wearables company that creates custom 3D-printed footwear, closed $3.5 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, after nearly six years of development and construction, TELUS and Westbank Projects Corp. opened TELUS Garden, a million-square-foot, $750-million complex, which the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global and Mail said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “perfectly encapsulates Vancouver urbanism in 2016: designed for sustainability, touched by progressive politics, engineered for profit.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6909" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Telus-garden.jpg" alt="Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson at Telus Garden" width="599" height="331" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Telus-garden.jpg 599w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Telus-garden-300x166.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /><br />

<h2>2016 &#8211; The Province Steps Up</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 picked up where 2015 left off, with a wave of financing deals and the unveiling of new office spaces, but additional provincial resources and support kicked things up a notch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all started with Bench, an online bookkeeping service for small businesses and independent contractors, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced that it closed a $20 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Series B up-round funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brought total capital raised by the company to $33 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right around the same time, BrainStation set up shop at 1110 Hamilton Street, in a space previously occupied by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic Arts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We were in good company, sharing the block with United Games, Slack, and SAP, who would, later that year, unveil </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an 11-million renovation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a 200,000-square-foot office in the same neighborhood. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;">“Vancouver is a hotbed for tech talent.” — Kirsten Sutton, Managing Director, SAP Labs Canada.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two months later, Microsoft opened a 142,000-square-foot office in the top two floors of the Pacific Centre mall, in the process doubling their workforce in the city (to 750 employees). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a global company we are always assessing where we should be in the world, where’s the talent, where’s the opportunity, where the right combination of factors is to consider growing our business and our workforce,” Karen Jones, then Microsoft’s Deputy General Counsel, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Vancouver Sun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “A year-and-a-half, two years ago we started looking at that and we looked at various locations around the world and Vancouver rose to the top.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6907" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Microsoft.jpg" alt="Microsoft Vancouver Justin Trudeau" width="640" height="444" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Microsoft.jpg 640w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Microsoft-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit: Microsoft</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wasn’t just lip service: Microsoft had made a large investment in Vancouver, spending </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 million designing and building</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state-of-the-art office space, which shortly after, would be the setting for the inaugural </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Vancouver TechFoos Challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (not to be confused with TechPong, the charity ping pong tournament between Vancouver tech companies). Dubbed “the biggest foosball tournament in Canada,&#8221; the competition featured 33 Vancouver tech companies, including Hootsuite, Quietly, Bench, ACL, Trulioo, and more. </span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit: Microsoft</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Slack would also complete a renovation of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">21,000 square-foot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office; a space so dynamic and inviting, Co-Founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield now splits his time between Vancouver and San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being at Slack, especially now, will be similar to having worked at Google, Facebook, or Apple in the mid 2000s,“ he said at the office’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">official unveiling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build on all this momentum, the Government of British Columbia launched the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BC Tech Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a $100 million venture capital fund to help local tech companies scale and grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“B.C.’s technology sector is consistently growing faster than the overall economy, making this the perfect time to catch the wave and help smaller companies join in the ranks of economy builders,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said then-Premier Christy Clark</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BC Tech Fund has $25 million earmarked for direct investment in early-stage companies, with the remaining $75 million allocated to venture capital funds, which are required to invest in B.C.-based startups. That first year, the Fund invested in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mojio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a fast-growing, Vancouver-based open platform for connecting cars. Just two months later, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mojio would announce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the closing of a $15 Million Series A round of financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injecting capital into the market was only part of the province’s strategy for the local tech sector. They also introduced a plan to add basic digital skills to child education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of the goal of including coding is creating that confidence in students who feel like they can control technology, rather than just be users of it at a young age,” John Jacobson, Deputy Minister of Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told Betakit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the BC Innovation Council, the province then launched the now annual </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">#BCTECH Summit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The event’s goal was to showcase made-in-B.C. innovations, provide networking opportunities, and host keynotes on topics like fintech, big data, and more. This was the first time an event like this had been organized in Vancouver, and it has since become a key meeting point for all things digital, with more than 2,000 people attending every year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The province also benefited from federal government policies in 2016. Canada’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Visa program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, helped bring Huzza Media to Vancouver. South African founders Justin Womersley and Nick Smit moved their company from Silicon Valley to Vancouver in 2016 with the help of the program, which gives permanent residency to entrepreneurs interested in starting  a company in Canada. Although no one would know it at the time, the move would soon help lure Kickstarter to Vancouver, but more on that later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Quark Venture Inc., a Canadian venture capital company, and GF Securities Company Limited, an investment bank in China,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced a $500 (USD) million health sciences venture fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in Vancouver. The fund, which is the largest of its kind in Canada, will invest globally in a diversified portfolio of biotechnology and health sciences companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same month, Vancouver-based venture capital firm Campfire Capital </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed a new $41.1 million venture capital fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on technology-driven consumer products and retail companies. Campfire Capital is backed by over 50 consumer and retail veterans with experience at brands like lululemon athletica, Starbucks, Nike, Aldo, Zara, DAVIDsTEA and Nasty Gal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right around the same time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mio Global</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creator of a wrist-based heart rate monitoring technology, announced $15M (USD) in funding, led by Hydra Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Vancouver-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bit Stew Systems Inc. was purchased by General Electric Co</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. in a deal valued at $153-million (USD). Yaletown Partners Inc., the firm that led Bit Stew&#8217;s Series A venture-capital round in 2013, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly made $22.5-million from the sale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  This was turning out to be a banner year for Yaletown Partners, as in April they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a new $135 million venture capital fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to invest in emerging growth companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same month, BDC Capital </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the launch of a $135-million venture capital fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support Canadian energy and cleantech start-up businesses. The goal of the fund is to invest in 15 to 20 new, high-impact Canadian startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in December, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netmarble Games Corp.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fastest-growing mobile game company in Asia, announced an agreement to acquire the Vancouver studio of Kabam, the creator of  “Marvel: Contest of Champions.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal reported that Kabam </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had received several offers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the studio in the range of $700 to $800 million, and that the sale price was in that range.</span></p>
<h2><strong><br />
</strong>2017 &#8211; Amazon and Beyond</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 continued the frenzied pace of financing and acquisition activity, with over $1.3 billion in capital raised. Kickstarter kicked it all off, announcing that it had acquired the aforementioned Huzza Media, which would become a Vancouver division of the crowdfunding giant, with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly opened space in Gastown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit: Kickstarter</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce furniture and home decor company, announced it would be relocating its headquarters to Strathcona, with a 115,000 square-foot, restored historic building at 1010 Raymur Avenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the financing front, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision Critical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of customer intelligence software, led the way, pulling down the third largest venture capital deal in all of Canada with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$76 million VC financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cloud-based analytics platform for HR professionals, was not far behind, closing Canada&#8217;s fourth largest venture capital financing with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$61 million financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This brought Visier&#8217;s total funding to $94.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Tasktop, a value stream management solution for software organizations, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $15 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a round led by AVX Partners, and joined by Austin Ventures and Yaletown Partners. The latter also invested in the company’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$11 million Series A round in 2014</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fall, 1QB Information Technologies Inc., a software company that uses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced quantum theory to solve computational challenges, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the close of a $45 million Series B round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comprising equity and revenue contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in December, ACL, a SaaS provider helping governments and companies fight fraud, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced that it had accepted a $50 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> minority investment by Norwest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help keep track of all the activity in the sector, the BC Tech Association launched the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BCTechBase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a database that provides information on more than 3,000 of the province’s technology companies, including recent financing and acquisition activity, growth stage, and workforce size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The BCTechBase is really intended to be a resource that can track companies as they progress over time, and provide the kind of dataset that we need to measure our progress as an ecosystem,” Bill Tam, president and CEO of the BC Tech Association, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">told BetaKit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fittingly, in October, the Vancouver Economic Commission (VEC) submitted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Vancouver region’s proposal for Amazon HQ2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which highlights the city’s unbeatable quality of life, the presence of world-class companies (like Slack, Microsoft, Boeing, Tableau and Electronic Arts), and the fact that six out of the 10 largest global tech companies currently operate in B.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same month the VEC submitted the Amazon bid, BrainStation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiled a state-of-the-art, 20,000 square-foot campus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</strong>2018 &#8211; On the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 kicked off with a bang, with PCI Developments and Low Tide Properties </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing a new, seven-storey office development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 565 Great Northern Way. Designed for what they called “the emerging digital media and creative sectors,” the development will offer 160,000 square feet of office space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re losing track of all the square footage mentioned so far, this is the equivalent of adding almost a tenth of the current office space in downtown Vancouver to the False Creek area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is big news for a city that now has the second lowest downtown office vacancy rate in North America and limited new supply coming to market,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair Quinn, Executive Vice President at CBRE Canada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This adds significant supply to an emerging neighborhood that has been endorsed by the global and local creative and tech companies, including the first tenants into this new building.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Blackbird Interactive Game Studio, Spaces (a provider of co-working spaces), and Samsung have all signed pre-leases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook will also be opening a new office at 200 Burrard Street, on the southeast corner of Canada Place Way. However, a spokesperson for the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the DailyHive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this may not happen until late 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft, meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pledged to invest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the study of a high-speed transportation system between Vancouver and Seattle. “Shorter travel times between Vancouver and Seattle would support new tech partnerships and investment opportunities between our neighbors to the south and our growing tech sector here in B.C.,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Jobs, Trade and Technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the homefront, BrainStation Vancouver continued to develop into a unique tech community hub. Our challenge with the new campus was to meet increasing demand (with bigger classes and full-time programs), while still replicating the dynamic ecosystems we’ve created in markets like New York and Toronto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to do our part to support the exponential growth in the local tech sector, and we&#8217;ve succeeded,” said Kyle Treleaven, Brainstation Vancouver’s General Manager. “Our campus has evolved into a really unique tech community hub, which we&#8217;re very proud of,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the campus’ opening, BrainStation has worked with instructors from some of the most innovative companies, including Slack, Amazon, Microsoft, Hootsuite, and more. We’ve also been fortunate to host keynotes and panel discussions with leading industry experts, including: </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, graduates from our full-time programs in Vancouver are now working at companies like Deloitte, Invoke, lululemon, Shopify, PwC, Bench, and Canucks Sports and Entertainment, among many others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, as you can see, a lot has happened since 2015, but just like the city of Vancouver itself, we’re only getting started&#8230;and the best is yet to come.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you’re a full-blown data nerd or someone that avoids numbers at all costs (guilty as charged), there’s no denying it: data skills are increasingly important. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/05/13/ibm-predicts-demand-for-data-scientists-will-soar-28-by-2020/&amp;refURL=https://www.google.ca/&amp;referrer=https://www.google.ca/">demand for data scientists is projected to rise by 28%</a> in the next two years, with a projected 2.7 million new data jobs.</p>
<p>If that gives you anxiety, we got some good news for you: BrainStation is now accepting applications for the Data Science Full-Time program at our Toronto and Vancouver campuses.</p>
<p>Taught by experienced educators currently working in the field, the 10-week program introduces cutting-edge data concepts and techniques, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting and storing data with Excel, XML and SQL, and more</li>
<li>Analyzing data using Python programming and relevant packages</li>
<li>Visualizing data using tools like Tableau and PowerBI</li>
<li>Data modelling using Python and R</li>
<li>Presenting findings in a clear and engaging way</li>
<li>Advanced topics like deep learning with TensorFlow and big data tools such as Hadoop</li>
</ul>
<p>Put simply, by program’s end, graduates will have the skills, experience, and confidence to dive into a career in data. But don’t just take my word for it; here’s what our Founder and CEO, Jason Field, had to say about the program:</p>
<p>&#8220;All industries, from retail to banking, are in the midst of digital transformation, which is creating a huge number of new positions in data science and analysis. To address this skills gap, we worked with our hiring partners (from some of Canada&#8217;s largest organizations) to develop a collaborative, hands-on learning environment that mimics what you will experience in the real world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>What does that real-world experience look like for a Data Scientist? To find out, check out <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/qa-data-science-expert-colin-fraser-telus">a conversation we had with Colin Fraser</a>, a Data Scientist at CHIMP (Charitable Impact), and a lead Instructor for BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-science">part-time Data Science course</a>.</p>

<p>Find out why she&#8217;s enrolled in the online SEO/SEM/Analytics course, and what she hopes to gain out of learning with us.</p>
<p><b>BrainStation: Which course are you taking with us? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheryl: Online SEO/SEM and Analytics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>What led you to take a course at BrainStation?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard about Brainstation last year from a friend who was interested in the User Experience Design course. We both ended up taking that part-time course and it was a reminder of how much I enjoy the web aspect of my job and how taking a course online gives me the flexibility to learn from anywhere. </span></p>
<p><b>What is your education and career background? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Graphic Design for Marketing | Graphic Designer and Marketing Coordinator. I am currently working full time as an in-house Graphic Designer/Marketing Coordinator in Vancouver. </span></p>
<p><b>Why are you taking this course? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a much better understanding of SEO, SEM, PPC, and Analytics. I&#8217;ve been self-taught with Google Analytics and I feel that I&#8217;ve only touched the surface of what there is to learn.</span></p>
<p><b>What aspects of the course are you most interested in? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m really interested in PPC and Remarketing. We currently contract a company to do this for us and its new territory for me. I would love to get a better understanding of how they both work and gain the confidence to do it on my own.</span></p>
<p><b>What gave you the push to invest in your career potential?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working closely with the company we&#8217;ve contracted to do our digital marketing really spiked my interest in how it all works. How do you find the appropriate keywords, how do you know they&#8217;re working, how do you know which group to target, how do you adjust your targeting if it isn&#8217;t working, how much do you spend on an ad, how do you choose your budget, etc. are just a few of the questions I have that have really given me motivation to learn more and take this course online. </span></p>
<p><b>Where do you see yourself after completing the course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing this online course, I see myself utilizing the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained and applying it to my work. I&#8217;m extremely excited to get started!</span></p>

<p><strong>What course are you enrolled in?</strong></p>
<p>Part-Time User Experience Design, at the Toronto Campus</p>
<p><strong>What did you decide to take this specific course?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really interested in learning about User Experience Design.  I think this course will be a nice complement to my psychology degree and a way for me to explore my interest in human centered design thinking.  I&#8217;m also quite interested in how design and user experience work in conjunction.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first hear about BrainStation?</strong></p>
<p>I found out about this course through online research and through a friend&#8217;s recommendation who had previously taken a course at BrainStation and loved it!</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose BrainStation?</strong></p>
<p>Among the schools that are currently offering courses on UX Design, BrainStation has the best reputation and the course outline matched my learning goals perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking to achieve by taking this course?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m looking to learn both about the research and design methods used in the process of creating a user experience. I also hope to figure out whether I am more interested in the design or research aspect. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>What prompted you to invest in your career potential?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve been looking at different courses in various digital disciplines over the past few months and decided on the User Experience Design course at Brainstation because it perfectly matched my learning goals, has a great reputation in the field.  It also gives me the flexibility of studying part-time in the evenings.</span></p>

<p><strong>Why did you decide to take this specific course?</strong></p>
<p>It seemed to offer a curriculum specific to my interest in product marketing and management that I am sure will challenge my skills and develop me as a Marketer and Product Manager.</p>
<p><strong>How did you first hear or read about the course and BrainStation?</strong></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to attend some workshops at the Toronto Campus as a delegate of the Queens University Marketing Association Conference (QMAC). The location and the venue itself were amazing.</p>
<p>I won a scholarship to BrainStation through the QMAC event. The curriculum seems to offer very specific learning material, and the instructors seem to be reputable engaging individuals.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking to achieve within the time enrolled in the course? What concept or area are you most interested in?</strong></p>
<p>As a freelancer &amp; entrepreneur, I am interested in learning more about Lean Product Development and how to develop a Minimal Viable Product.</p>
<p><strong>What gave you the push or sparked your interest to further your digital skills and education overall?</strong></p>
<p>Being so early in my career, I want to equip myself with experiences and a deeper understanding of marketing as a whole to give myself an advantage over my peers upon graduation from university. I believe my time at BrainStation will set myself up for success in the long term by expanding my marketing acumen.</p>
