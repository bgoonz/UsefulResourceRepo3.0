								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Great Acceleration</strong> – the latest instalment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series &#8211; took place on February 25 and featured leaders from <strong>Peloton</strong>, <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>KraftHeinz</strong>, <strong>Snyk</strong>, and<strong> Betterment</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the recap here:</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/516922129" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p></p>



<h2>Forming Digital-First Teams</h2>



<p>Following the unprecedented challenges 2020 presented to the world, BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Skills Survey looked to explore the state of digital transformations and what companies could be doing to build upon existing efforts to embrace a digital-first culture.</p>



<p>The survey found that digital acceleration shows no signs of slowing down, as 77 percent of organizations said they plan to increase their digital transformation activities and 80 percent said there are digital elements of their business that did not exist even two years ago.</p>



<p>Dipti Salopek, VP of People at Snyk said, “All companies are software companies now. Anything you consider standard retail is now e-commerce. It was going to be the way of the world and COVID just accelerated it.”</p>



<p>Global stay-at-home orders also saw the acceleration of remote work and the growth of international teams.</p>



<p>Brittany Forsyth, Chief Talent Officer at Shopify, spoke to Shopify’s policy for their employees of working “Digital by Default” early in 2020 to allow all team members to work remotely indefinitely moving forward.</p>



<p>“Working remotely had some challenges but it democratized interactions,” said Salopek. “Every participant and speaker and the same amount of voice and space, which made their all-hands meetings more engaging and collaborative.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel, however, stressed the importance of gathering the right data –&nbsp;only this way can you identify and leverage the advantages presented by a digital-first work culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You need to have access to the right data in order to analyze it and make informed decisions,” said Serena Huang, Head of Global People Analytics at Kraft Heinz. “That is the starting point to know where you’re starting from and then you can understand what skills you need.”<br></p>



<h2>Know the Skills Already On Your Team</h2>



<p>More than ever, companies are now required to innovate to meet changing customer needs at the right time, and to deliver the right solutions.</p>



<p>Tim Brown, VP of Talent at Peloton, learned the importance of pressure-testing their own infrastructure after Peloton saw such hyper-growth in 2020 that it strained their existing supply chain. They now are able to find where their limitations are within the existing structure, and how to then overcome those limitations.</p>



<p>“You need to be able to get the right data as [your organization] continues to grow,” said Brown. “You could have 10 great Engineers, but if you don’t have a good Designer, all the work the Engineers did won’t translate to your customer.”</p>



<p>BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey shows that a key trend among respondents was that they felt their organization would be more successful with more data skills. What many companies fail to recognize, however, is that they often already have the skill sets they’re hiring for within their organization in unsuspecting positions.</p>



<p>Most companies can’t answer simple questions like how many people know Python really well. They may know how many Data Scientists they have; but your best Python knowledge-holder may work in finance,” Huang noted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know the scale of abilities already within your teams, you can create meaningful employee engagement opportunities by pairing a person’s skill set with their unique professional development goals. You can also look past technical competencies to find other ways that employees can add value to their team, including what Huang called ‘leadership skills,’ or soft skills, that are often developed in previous experiences.</p>



<p>“Learning agility seems to be an indicator of success compared to most other skills,” said Salopek. “The ability to step out of your comfort zone to try something new, and having the confidence to fail is a sought after skill to support digital transformation, especially for existing and emerging leaders.”</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Learn Today to Lead Tomorrow</h2>



<p>75 percent of executives who responded to the survey said they believe digital skills training would make them more successful.</p>



<p>Susan Justus, Senior Director and Head of Talent Development at Betterment, has been piloting a number of initiatives using design thinking that are geared towards emerging leaders and managers to keep learning.</p>



<p>“We believe in knowledge sharing,” said Justus.“We had the data analytics team present to other teams on how to better work with data analytics as not everyone thinks from an analytics mindset.”</p>



<p>Looking inward to create these learning opportunities provides insight for the hiring process when needing to source skills from outside your organization.</p>



<p>“When hiring teams, you have to look at the skills but also the competency,” said Brown. “How long would it take someone to learn the skills versus to bring someone on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Huang agreed: “You need to find the right skills before you find the right talent. Be clear on the skills you need for your company to succeed.”</p>



<p>The Digital Skills Survey found that there are a number of emerging roles that can have a big impact on organizational growth, which employees can land by upskilling in key areas. These include: Artificial Intelligence Specialist, Experience Designer, Product Owner, Site Reliability Engineer, Cybersecurity Specialist, and Big Data Developer.</p>



<p>“Anything related and obliquely related to software development, including UX and product design, is going to be in demand for the foreseeable future,” Salopek added.</p>



<p>Marketing and Development are also the two disciplines that organizations are planning to hire the most in 2021, leaving lots of opportunities for those looking to enter the tech sector.</p>



<p>Huang noted that while creating opportunities is good, creating the culture and space for employees to take advantage of the initiatives is imperative. “A lot of people are also struggling to find time to learn because they feel very busy,” she said. “How can learning be part of the workday and to create a culture that motivates learning, and having X percentage of time devoted to failing and learning from it if it doesn&#8217;t succeed.”</p>



<p>Justus added, “A lot of people are experiencing a different challenge with their home or work situation and are looking to find ways to meet people where they are to keep a growth mindset at the forefront.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The one constant the panelists know for sure is to continue expecting the unexpected. </p>



<p>People that develop digital agility and continue future-proofing their skills will be well-positioned for long term success throughout their professional journeys.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BlogPost&amp;utm_campaign=datacertificates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python Programming</a> training will give you a fundamental understanding of Python, which in turn enables you to learn more complex machine learning and data science concepts moving forward.</span></p>

<h2><b>Squarespace </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A search for online portfolio sites will probably lead you to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squarespace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a top contender. That&#8217;s because Squarespace&#8217;s drag-and-drop design tools make it easy for anyone with basic computer skills to build a portfolio that looks professional on a small budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squarespace offers plenty of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">portfolio template options</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to choose from, and it&#8217;s easy to browse by category to get inspired and find an option that works for you. Most Squarespace templates are focused on visuals, so it&#8217;s a good idea to have high-quality images ready to go if you choose this option.    </span></p>
<p><b>Pricing: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 to $40 per month (students can get 50 percent off)</span></p>
<p><b>Sample portfolios:</b><a href="https://carroll-demo.squarespace.com/?nochrome=false&amp;_ga=2.38502692.680724430.1581346264-1965033353.1581346264&amp;_gac=1.26702287.1581346475.Cj0KCQiAm4TyBRDgARIsAOU75srssreKdKOlQ9i5n09csLw7TuC7M7c5a-Yki0tPhWGgqpz68I5ge78aAmOdEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> C<span style="font-weight: 400;">reative Project Manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://jannalynnhagan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> W<span style="font-weight: 400;">eb and Graphic Designer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://boldandpop.com/social-media-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span></p>
<p><b>Skill level: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic to intermediate (you can add customization with CSS and Javascript with the second tier pricing option)</span></p>
<h2><b>Wix</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wix is one of the most popular free options available. Like Squarespace, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wix</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses a drag-and-drop tool that makes it easy for anyone to use. One of the main differences is that Wix allows you to move elements anywhere on the page (Squarespace is less flexible, which is not a bad thing if you don&#8217;t have an eye for design). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wix is a good option for someone (like a designer) who wants to have more control over how their portfolio looks, but without needing to know how to code.</span></p>
<p><b>Pricing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Free up to $25 per month (students can get 50 percent off)</span></p>
<p><b>Sample portfolios:</b><a href="https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1919?siteId=44361882-aac5-4cb2-8393-a1d0bea73a57&amp;metaSiteId=fb2a276e-da6d-4a21-925e-3af753a7a924&amp;originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fportfolio-cv%2Fportfolios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">3D Designer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1886?siteId=df38e4b2-59a5-467a-b35d-4881cf3195e8&amp;metaSiteId=eb009581-7f72-4fc4-b049-d6a2a4a0b708&amp;originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fportfolio-cv%2Fportfolios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> W<span style="font-weight: 400;">eb and Graphic Designer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2083?siteId=87c59c6d-42a1-4180-950a-2324d8a04f93&amp;metaSiteId=9089e92e-de02-4385-9457-c5f9e9e4a13d&amp;originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fbusiness%2Fadvertising-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">content marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Skill level: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic to intermediate (you can add customization and plugins with Javascript)</span></p>
<h2><b>Behance </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Pinterest for portfolios, Adobe-owned </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows you to create project pages that showcase your work. Projects are featured on your homepage where views and “appreciations” (similar to likes) are tallied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behance is all about the visuals, so consider another option if your work doesn&#8217;t have a strong visual element. A popular choice for UI and UX designers, Behance allows users to tag projects under creative tools including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe XD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Illustrator, Photoshop, and other Adobe software.  </span></p>
<p><b>Pricing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Free</span></p>
<p><b>Sample portfolios: </b><a href="https://www.behance.net/michelesalati" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Director</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.behance.net/pyatykhina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI/UX Designer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (websites), </span><a href="https://www.behance.net/relictos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI/UX Designers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (apps)</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second annual </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2020-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> polled thousands of tech professionals on their lives at work, their most-used tools, their professional development efforts, and their predictions for the future – and across all disciplines, one thing was made extremely clear: ongoing digital skills training is the new secret to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aiming to provide critical insights into the mindset of tech workers while also ensuring organizations are properly allocating learning, development and upskilling resources, BrainStation’s survey found that respondents in all six disciplines surveyed – data, development, design, marketing, product management, and executive – overwhelmingly felt their organizations would achieve more success with a more digitally savvy workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s encouraging, then, that BrainStation’s survey found employers were anticipating this need, with 42 percent of executives reporting that their organizations had already implemented digital skills training initiatives, and another 19 percent pledging plans to offer that training in the future. That commitment to continuing education is certainly a positive thing, considering the World Economic Forum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than half (54 percent) of all employees will require significant reskilling by 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That couldn’t happen soon enough, particularly since BrainStation’s survey found that organizations are increasingly bolstering their digital strategy. Among corporate executives polled, 92 percent reported that digital transformation was a top strategic business priority, with 74 percent having already taken steps in that direction and another 18 percent planning to do so over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, it seems skills training will be a crucial element in that process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 2020 Digital Skills Survey findings really make clear that professionals now understand that, in order to keep pace with the rapid rate of change in technology, continuously upgrading their skills is a necessity,” said Jason Field, Founder and CEO, BrainStation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our survey also highlights an increasing focus on cross-discipline learning as tech professionals and employers alike are placing a priority on more broad, well-rounded skill sets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to take a closer look at each of the six disciplines surveyed to see which digital skills were in high demand and low supply.</span></p>
<h2><b>Data</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an exaggeration to say that the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence has irrevocably transformed pretty much every industry there is, from </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-changing-the-future-of-healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">healthcare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-big-data-has-transformed-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">professional sports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-data-is-being-used-in-restaurants-and-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">food</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-and-machine-learning-are-being-used-to-make-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">art</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/4-major-industries-are-being-revolutionized-by-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beyond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Demand for Data Scientists is forecast to rise by 28 percent by next year, creating an additional 2.7 million jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not surprising, then, that there’s a rapidly growing appetite for data skill training in pretty much every discipline and industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a look at the big picture, 83 percent of respondents to BrainStation’s survey ranked the data literacy in their organizations as lagging, while 89 percent said that dearth of data literacy was having an effect on the success of their organization’s projects, and 59 percent said their organizations would be more successful if employees had better data skills. If that last number seems low, it might indicate that even more progress will need to be made transitioning more organizations into a data-first mindset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of their own data teams, 48.2 percent of data professionals ranked the overall level of data literacy within their companies as “basic,” while only 17.3 percent reported a data literacy level of advanced or expert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 74.8 percent of data professionals felt that digital skills training would make them more effective in their roles – and 55.6 percent of those professionals specifically wanted more data training (meanwhile, 15.7 percent felt they would benefit from learning about development, 12 percent wanted to learn more about design, and 9.3 percent wanted more digital marketing training).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digging deeper, it makes sense that data professionals want to upgrade their data skills. Looking to the next five to 10 years, 78 percent of data respondents predicted that artificial intelligence would have the most impact followed by machine learning (70 percent), but a majority of data respondents – 63 percent – said they don’t currently work with AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, data professionals are typically now expected to be comfortable using a wide variety of statistical and machine learning techniques – linear regression being the most popular, with 55 percent familiarity among respondents – and yet 35 percent of those surveyed had never used any of those techniques at all, showing a clear need for further upskilling in that area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With demand for data skills soaring, BrainStation’s survey also made it clear that many are changing careers to take advantage. According to the survey, 76 percent of data scientists who responded did not begin their career in data, and 68 percent have been working in the field for five years or less.</span><b> </b></p>
<h2><b>Web Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area poised for rapid growth – the U.S. Bureau of Labor is forecasting this job market will grow by 15 percent by 2026 – the fields of mobile and web development are changing so rapidly that, again, Developers must continue to educate themselves to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 80 percent of Web Developers reported that digital skills training would make them more successful, with 52 percent looking for additional development skills, 20 percent focused on data and 12 percent focused on design. Interestingly, 30 percent of Developers reported that additional development skills would boost their organizations, while 21 percent chose data. Also relating to data, 86 and 84 percent of Developers felt that AI and machine learning respectively would have the most impact on their field in the coming years, yet only 17 percent have worked with any AI platforms or blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, we have recently looked at how Developers can benefit from acquiring </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/3-reasons-why-developers-make-great-data-scientists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and design skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is by far the most popular programming language among the Developers polled – 75 percent reported using it regularly – while SQL continues to climb in popularity to 47 percent, highlighting another potential upskilling opportunity for much of the Development workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development is another field where transplants are driving in droves – 54 percent reported beginning their careers in a different field. Still, executives reported a difficult time finding Developers with all the necessary skills in their toolkit; although they reported that they would be doing the most hiring in development (41 percent), 39 percent said that it was the most difficult area to hire for.</span></p>
<h2><b>Design</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often said that user experience (UX) design is a field that requires several different </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-skills-does-a-ux-designer-need" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">types of skills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at once – including technical tools, business know-how, and transferable personal skills such as empathy and communication – so it’s not surprising how many UX Designers are committed to continuous learning; 79 percent of Designers surveyed reported that they would be more successful with additional digital skills training (such as <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design?utm_source=BNSTNBlog&amp;utm_medium=BlostPost&amp;utm_campaign=course_SkillsSecretToSuccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX design courses</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Designers want to polish their skills in design (34 percent) and product management (23 percent). They’d like to see a little more overall design literacy within their organizations, pointing to a need for those in other disciplines to understand more about user-centric design; nearly 77 percent reported their company’s design literacy was either basic or intermediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the results, it’s clear to see which competencies specifically are lacking. Although 74.4 percent of UX Designers polled design for web, only 37.2 percent report working on native mobile. Even more problematic? Only 5.6 percent have designed for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms, while only 14 percent have worked with voice-based interfaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That suggests a workforce-wide need to modernize and upgrade skills.</span></p>
<h2><b>Marketing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent sea change in marketing – as the spend on digital has finally surpassed traditional advertising channels – this is a field where digital skills are becoming a major differentiator for tech talent, and perhaps even a game-changer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-marketers-need-to-focus-on-digital-skills-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, research from Burning Glass Technologies shows that four in 10 marketing job openings now call for digital marketing skills, with the number of postings calling for digital skills almost doubling between 2011 and 2016. Digital marketing roles grew 30 percent faster over that period than overall marketing postings (while also taking 16 percent longer to fill), and digital marketing skills carried nearly a $7,000 salary premium over other marketing postings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, another study carried out by Target Internet with the Chartered Institute of Marketing painted a portentous picture of the digital skills gap in marketing, as a group of marketers tested on skill areas including data, content marketing, digital strategy, SEO, social media marketing, and usability produced dismal scores (the marketers couldn’t surpass a 36 percent score in any one topic).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hardly surprising, then, that 89 percent of marketers polled by BrainStation said digital skills training would make them perform better in their role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly – and unlike most of the other fields explored here – marketers want more than anything to build out their multi-disciplinary skillset, with 33.6 percent said their company should focus on data skill training, and 31.5 percent saying that further marketing training was a top priority. And 78 percent reported that there was room for improvement in their organization’s marketing literacy.</span></p>
<p>Feel the same way? Find out more about BrainStation&#8217;s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/digital-marketing?utm_source=BNSTNBlog&amp;utm_medium=BlostPost&amp;utm_campaign=course_SkillsSecretToSuccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing courses</a>.</p>
<h2><b>Product Management</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “mini-CEOs” of a product, Product Managers are often expected to be jack-of-all-trade types with broad skill sets that incorporate any number of specializations. They’re handsomely rewarded for that – Hired’s 2017 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global State of Tech Salaries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survey found that Product Managers’ average salary of $138,000 was the very highest of any tech role, while LinkedIn lists the role as one of its </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/product-manager-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most promising jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – but clearly, Product Managers can’t afford to be complacent where skill training is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 78 percent of product management respondents felt that digital skills training would make them more effective. Reflecting on the multi-disciplinary demands of their position, those surveyed were split on what kind of training would be most beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it seems like Product Managers want to learn more about everything related to tech: 31.7 percent want more data training, 24.6 percent want to invest further in product skills, 19 percent are interested in boosting their development toolkit, while 13.4 percent have an interest in boosting their marketing skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, AR and VR represent significant skill deficits within the product sphere – a massive 88 percent have never been involved with either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s encouraging news for anyone eyeing a career in Product Management; 86 percent of those surveyed started their careers in a different field. Clearly, they already know a thing or two about upskilling. </span></p>
<h2><b>Executive</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned earlier, Executives are overwhelmingly committed to bringing digital transformation to their organizations; in fact, 82 percent said that their digital investments were growing or stable (and only 4.9 percent said they were shrinking), while 92 percent plan to increase their digital transformation activities in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, digital transformations often fail; a McKinsey report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that only 16 percent of respondents said their digital transformations successfully improved performance and equipped them to sustain changes in the long term. McKinsey’s report also found that organizations that offered skill and leadership development opportunities were nearly twice as likely to succeed in those digital transformations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s heartening, then, that beyond efforts to educate their employees, 72 percent of executives also feel that they too would benefit from digital skills training. Particularly, they’re focused on data (35 percent) and marketing (26 percent). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, by looking at the areas in which executives expect to invest the most money and resources, we can get further clues about the optimal areas of skill-building and development for the tech workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, digital marketing skills certainly appear to be in high demand. Executives reported investing in SEO (57 percent), email marketing (56 percent), content marketing (55 percent) and organic social media (52 percent). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, again, it seems tech professionals of all stripes would be well-served by learning more about AI and machine learning – executives expect to invest in both in 2020, at a rate of 45 percent and 38.9 percent respectively.</span></p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-habits-do-successful-founders-share">What Habits Do Successful Founders Share?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://brainstation.io/blog">BrainStation® Blog</a>.</p>
]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re looking to improve yourself on a professional or personal level, it’s always a wise idea to emulate the best. And when it comes to developing good habits that encourage productivity, creativity, and general success, you’d be hard-pressed to find better role models than the founders of the world’s top startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Airbnb’s Brian Chesky to Stitch Fix’s Katrina Lake to Spotify’s Daniel Ek – or even the super-famous likes of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, or Mark Zuckerberg – when it comes to founders and CEOs, there are ties that seem to bind even the most seemingly dissimilar personalities. And in many cases, the connective tissue is in the small things – founders tend to have the discipline to set and stick to certain best practices in their day-to-day routines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we looked at the habits that most successful founders seem to share.</span></p>
<h2><b>They Make the Most of Every Minute</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply put, founders don’t have time to waste. And when it comes to maximizing every minute of their day, some have gotten pretty creative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk –  the CEO of Tesla and the mind behind SpaceX – said in 2016 that he was working 85 to 100 hours per week as he juggled both companies. How did he manage? One tactic was to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">break his day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into five-minute slots. He’s even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">got</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the habit of wolfing down his lunch in just five minutes – usually during a meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the single best piece of advice: Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself,” he has </span><a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/13/elon-musk-secrets-of-effectiveness/#fqb.ktmW9mqD" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s not alone in finding creative ways to make the absolute most of his day. Capify CEO and founder David Goldin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedules</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> some of his most important calls during his morning commute. Anne Wojcicki of 23andme even stopped paying for parking largely because she doesn’t like wasting her time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I get parking tickets all the time. We’ve worked out the stats and it’s 50-50 odds of getting a ticket and the cost versus time saved means I can accept it,” she </span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/parking-illegally-makes-mathematical-sense-says-23andmes-wojcicki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><b>They Cherish Their Calendars</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With schedules regimented down to the last detail, founders seem to have few things they covet like their calendars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin makes her calendar a central focus of her day – and that of her team since she makes it public for all her direct reports to see how she spends her time. She’s not only meticulous about logging her appointments, but also reviewing her calendar to make sure she’s spending time on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">right </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am really crazy when it comes to my calendar. I’m hypervigilant about making sure that I spend time on the right things,” </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-founders-guide-to-discipline-lessons-from-fronts-mathilde-collin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Collin, whose shared inbox startup kicked off 2020 with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a $59 million Series C funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I don’t always know what I’m doing, then I get sucked into checking my emails or answering questions instead of focusing on what I said was most important at the beginning of the week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn’t just log the big events in her calendar. She blocks off larger chunks of time for a “time for culture” session in which she spends time considering her employees and whether they seem happy. She also books 15-minute blocks to write emails to her employees or read over recent research. She even has a 15-minute chunk of time blocked off specifically for reviewing her calendar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a unique time-management strategy while he was working eight hours per day at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the social-media company and pre-IPO Square. He created a theme for each day; Monday was for management, Tuesday was about product, Wednesday was devoted to marketing, communications, and growth, and so on. Not every day was devoted to work, of course – he took Saturdays off to hike and Sundays to reflect and strategize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many leaders also emphasize the importance of actually booking unscheduled time into their calendars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This enables me to get things done on the same day instead of allowing the guilt pile to build up,” </span><a href="https://time.com/4027015/business-success-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dr. Walter S. Scott, founder of satellite imagery company DigitalGlobe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am significantly more productive when I am not forced to multitask,” he added. “By creating pockets of time in which I can work alone, I am able to accomplish tasks on the same day and leave time for collaboration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carving out alone time during the workday is a priority for Spotify’s Daniel Ek as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also has another piece of advice for the bold: don’t be afraid to cancel a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just don’t have as many meetings as you think,” Ek </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90213545/exclusive-spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-on-apple-facebook-netflix-and-the-future-of-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Instead I have a lot of me time where I’m just thinking; I’m at a whiteboard drawing by myself. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I have a call or another meeting, I’ll just block it out if I’m in the zone,” he added. “That’s unorthodox because it means that you’re breaking social contracts, you’re disappointing someone because you didn’t show up. But if you’re really, really focused, those are the times when the breakthroughs come. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might go for three days and not sleep because I’m focused in that moment.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They Establish Rules Around Work-Life Balance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although different leaders have different thoughts on what work-life balance actually looks like, something founders seem to have in common is that they find an equilibrium that works for them – and then they establish clear rules around it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re certainly motivated by creating a happy home life, but also by ensuring that they’re bringing their best self to the office each day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Failure of your company is not failure in life. Failure in your relationships is,” </span><a href="https://medium.com/@ev/formula-for-entrepreneurial-success-ea0b02c504cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ev Williams, CEO of Medium and co-founder of Twitter. “When you don’t sleep, eat crap, don’t exercise, and are living off adrenaline for too long, your performance suffers. Your decisions suffer. Your company suffers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much demand on their time from inside and outside their companies, founders typically find it helpful to set clear boundaries. Tumblr’s David Karp </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t allow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laptops in the bedroom. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos wakes up naturally, without an alarm clock, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t schedule</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> morning meetings so he can spend time with his family. Boll &amp; Branch founders Scott and Missy Tannen make sure they’re home every day early enough to have a family dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be co-founders, but we are also mom and dad to three daughters. No matter how hectic running a fast-growing startup is, we make sure to shut off the cell phones and have a family dinner with our girls,” they </span><a href="https://time.com/4027015/business-success-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “While many CEOs are still going strong at six p.m., we’re passing the green beans and focusing on what matters most to us — our family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s most amazing is how many of our business and marketing ideas have come from our twin eight-year-olds and our 11-year-old right at the dinner table.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, oftentimes it’s having kids that prompt these leaders to finally surrender to a more sane schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that has been an adjustment being a new mom is that the morning is some of the most valuable time I have with my son,” </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-katrina-lake-the-founder-of-stitch-fix-2017-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stitch Fix’s Katrina Lake. “It used to be that I would check email and Instagram first thing in bed, and now as soon as he&#8217;s up, I&#8217;m up. I&#8217;ve really appreciated the clarity and being able to start the day in a more organic way with my son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really important for me to feel present when I&#8217;m at work, that I&#8217;m totally listening and paying attention and not worrying about what my son is doing. On the flip side, I try to bring that same level of being present at home. I want to feel totally present in everything I do.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They Take Care of Their Bodies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with impenetrably tight schedules, the world’s top founders seem to share a commitment to health and fitness – and some even have some quirky workout habits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google co-founder Sergey Brin is a daredevil whose athletic interests </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">span</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gymnastics, high-flying trapeze, springboard diving, ultimate Frisbee and hockey. Mint.com founder Aaron Patzer lifts weights and runs, but he also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">loves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> climbing trees – a habit he picked up when he was 3. Other Founders find creative ways to weave wellness into their days; 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki is an admitted “fitness freak” who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">biked five miles to work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day while eight months pregnant. Apple’s Tim Cook </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wakes up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around 4:30 a.m. daily to ensure several trips to the gym per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this exercise isn’t just about looking good. Most draw a connection between their physical health and their job performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Staying in shape is very important,” </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-workout-routine-2015-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. “Doing anything well requires energy and you just have a lot more energy when you’re fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I make sure I work out at least three times a week – usually first thing when I wake up. I also try to take my dog running whenever I can, which has the added bonus of being hilarious because that’s basically like seeing a mop run.”</span></p>
<h2><b>They Set Goals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders juggle so many disparate concerns that it can be easy to lose sight of the big picture. So it’s not surprising that many are fastidious about setting clear goals and reviewing them often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, as part of his daily routine, Spotify’s Ek writes out his goals for the day, week, and month, and every evening he checks to see how he’s doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then I just allocate my time (to match the goals),” he said. “People think that creativity is this free spirit that has no boundaries. No, actually the most creative people in the world schedule their creativity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front’s Collin makes an effort not just to set goals, but to communicate them to the rest of her team. At 10 a.m. sharp every Monday morning, she sends a note to her direct reports outlining her goals for the week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about telling your reports every single thing you’re going to do. Rather, it’s a chance to share what’s top-of-mind for you, which of course should be top-of-mind for them,” she </span><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-founders-guide-to-discipline-lessons-from-fronts-mathilde-collin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadcasting her goals to her team also has the added benefit of keeping Collin focused, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I start to slip or if my weeks don’t ladder up to those big goals we’re focusing on, that sends the wrong message.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those goals should realistic, but also ambitious. In fact, Box co-founder Aaron Levie considered it one of his main roles with the cloud enterprise storage company to keep the company’s collective sights set high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Probably the biggest value that I add to this company is reminding people to push on the scale of the opportunity – to realize that they can do something 10 times bigger, 10 times better, 10 times faster,” he </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/23/8-companies-poised-to-disrupt-their-industries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><b>They Keep Informed</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the swift-moving startup world, staying on top means staying on top of what’s happening – and what the competition is up to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s easy to understand why many founders start their day with a deep dive through the news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I do once out of bed is read 15 to 30 minutes religiously,” </span><a href="https://time.com/4027015/business-success-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ahmed Albaiti, Founder and CEO of digital health innovation company Medullan. “I jot down anything interesting for rumination vis-à-vis healthcare, (such as) Netflix’s god mode or Jaguar’s brainwave tracker. It’s amazing how many dots you can connect by just reading.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdGreetz founder and CEO Eric Frankel says he reads “voraciously,” a habit he picked up much earlier in his career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My first job at Warner Bros. was preparing a daily press packet without internet,” Frankel </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/christina-desmarais/the-daily-habits-of-35-people-at-the-top-of-their-game.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I had to read everything physically, clip pertinent articles, copy and distribute them to execs. This job taught me the power one garners by knowing everything that’s going on in business and the world — who’s doing well and might be a candidate for a sale of a popular Warner Bros. TV series or movie and who is in trouble and might need a hit TV series or movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One needs to be able to converse with other executives intelligently about their business.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation recently surveyed thousands of professionals and industry leaders to better understand their day-to-day experience and to spot trends and shifts in the digital sector. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re happy to announce that the results of the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2020-results"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Digital Skills Survey are now live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Skills Survey covered six professional disciplines and functions:</span><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7421" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-1024x289.gif" alt="Digital Skills Survey disciplines" width="1024" height="289" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-1024x289.gif 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-300x85.gif 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-768x217.gif 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coverage-5-960x271.gif 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were then broken down further into four areas:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills and tools</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future trends</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some highlights of the overall findings.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Transformation is Happening </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written quite a bit about digital transformation as an urgent need for organizations around the world, and the survey results confirmed that this is a top strategic business priority. 74 percent of executives, in fact, claimed that their company was already undertaking digital transformation initiatives, and a further 18 percent claimed that they would also be increasing their digital investments and initiatives in the year ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To emphasize this even further,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">80 percent of respondents said that there were new elements of their products and services today that did not exist a mere five years ago. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Skills Training is Now Required </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey results proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that professionals now view digital skills training as a professional necessity across all functions and levels. Respondents in every field felt that additional skills training would make them more successful in their current roles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80 percent of Web Developers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent of Designers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent of Marketers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78 percent of Product Managers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">75 percent of Data professionals </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting is that</span><b> 72 percent of Executives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also said that additional training would improve their performance, which indicates that a desire and a need for digital skills and experience is being felt across organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Respondents wanted to continue learning within their field, but there was also a strong demand for cross-discipline learning, which illustrates the need and importance of much broader skill sets. Respondents in all fields, for example, said that data skills would be the skill that would most help them be more successful in their role. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations Are Upskilling</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a surprise that executives we surveyed said that development was the area where they planned to do the most hiring this year (with marketing not far behind). 43 percent said they planned plan to look externally to meet these hiring needs. However, upskilling and reskilling is clearly on the rise. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10529" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-1024x429.png" alt="Where will you do the most hiring?" width="1024" height="429" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-1024x429.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-300x126.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-768x322.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM-960x403.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-07-at-3.31.11-PM.png 1936w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey results, 42 percent said of Executives said their organizations have already implemented digital skills training initiatives and 19 percent said they’d be implementing it in the future. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reskilling is now cheaper than hiring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we expect this to increase in the future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionals Have to Keep Up With New Digital Tools</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are, of course, many programming languages out there, but for the second year in a row, JavaScript is by far the most widely used language. 75 percent of respondents said that they used it regularly. The next most popular was SQL at 47 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the data front, Excel is the most widely used analysis tool, although only 66 percent of respondents are using it the most (compared with 81 percent in 2019). What the results show, however, is that Data Scientists (as opposed to data or business analysts) use a broader range of tools than the other data roles, including Python. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics is the most widely used campaign measurement tool, with a massive 82 percent of marketing respondents saying they use it to track performance. However, what’s even more interesting here is that more than 80 percent have also used Excel or custom-built solutions, which would suggest that the off-the-shelf software solutions are maybe not getting the job done. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And when it comes to the tools of the design trade, InVision and Sketch are the most popular tools currently being used by Designers for the second year in a row. Illustrator, Photoshop, and Adobe XD were also cited for wireframing, which highlights the varied skillsets and technical capabilities required in the field. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other important thing to consider here: InVision was only launched nine years. Marvel, Framer, Principle, are also all relatively new companies and software platforms – the design field, clearly, is changing very rapidly, and professionals need to stay on top of changing tools.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10525" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph-1024x684.png" alt="design graph survey" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph-1024x684.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph-300x200.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph-768x513.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph-960x641.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/design-graph.png 2488w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Landscape is Changing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram was cited as the most effective platform for social media marketing, with 67 percent of respondents preferring it. Facebook came out on top last year, which would suggest that Instagram is growing in importance for marketers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of LinkedIn is also worth keeping an eye on. The professional network came in third this year, behind Facebook and Instagram, but it leapfrogged Twitter and grew the most out of any platform cited in the survey. This may indicate that LinkedIn may soon be playing a much bigger role in marketing initiatives in 2020 and beyond. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10526" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM-1024x617.png" alt="Most popular social media platforms" width="1024" height="617" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM-1024x617.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM-300x181.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM-768x463.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM-960x578.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-10-at-4.21.09-PM.png 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities Abound in Emerging Roles</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 Digital Skills Survey results make it clear that the majority of professionals taking advantage of the demand in emerging roles did not start their careers in those fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">86 percent of Product Managers, for example, did not start their careers in product management or product development. Data is another great example, as a remarkable 76 percent of data respondents did not begin their career in data, and in fact, 68 percent have only been working in the discipline for five years or less. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The start of a new year often has the effect of pulling us out of the chaotic holiday season to reflect on all that we’ve accomplished in the last 365 days. It’s also a great opportunity to consider what we want to strive to accomplish in the next.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re reading this article, it might also be said that you’re feeling the itch of a potential career change and need a little inspiration to get you started.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five well-paying, under-the-radar jobs in tech to help ignite your transition.</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning Engineer</span></h2>



<p><b>What does a Machine Learning Engineer do?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning Engineers are highly-skilled Programmers who develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that use large data sets to research, develop, and generate algorithms that can learn and make predictions. According to </span><a href="http://blog.indeed.com/2019/03/14/best-jobs-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Machine Learning Engineer was listed as the number one job in 2019, experiencing a 344 percent growth in job postings between 2015-2018.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider it in comparison to a Data Analyst. A Data Analyst understands and combines data sets with the goal of generating insights for human consumption and action. A Machine Learning Engineer uses data sets to develop programs that enable machines to run with minimal human intervention. These programs need to be able to handle the vast amount of data that businesses are collecting today as well as run smoothly within the existing ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Machine Learning Engineer might develop something like Netflix’s recommendation engine or a program for a self-driving car.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What skills are needed?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies look for a degree in a quantitative field such as Applied Mathematics or Computer Science. If you don’t have that, aim to get four to six years of software development experience under your belt. Many job descriptions call for knowledge of programming languages like Python, Java, and C/C++. Essentially, you’ll want to present a strong understanding of probability and statistical models.</span></p>



<p><b>Average U.S Salary:</b> <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-salary-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$146,085</span></a></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Writer&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><b>What does a UX Writer do?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about the last time you were using your favorite app and a piece of copy grabbed your attention. Maybe it even made you smile. That’s the magic of a User Experience (UX) Writer.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Writers, also sometimes called Content Designers, craft the concise and compelling digital copy on websites and mobile apps that help you understand how to use a new product, fill out a form and everything in between. They sit on the UX team and work closely with product and UX designers to understand user needs in order to produce precise microcopy such as button copy, tooltips, and error messages.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Writers play a vital role in shaping the user experience and bringing the brand to life. It’s their goal to make even the most complex ideas crystal clear.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What skills are needed?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many UX Writers are former copywriters and content marketers, but a writing degree isn’t mandatory. Of course, you need to exude a certain level of wordsmithery. But more importantly, UX Writers need to understand the end-user to a degree where they can comfortably guide, engage, and delight them in as few words as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Average U.S Salary</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/UX-Writer-Salary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$124,873</span></a></p>



<p><b>Recommended BrainStation courses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience Design Certificate</span></a></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Database Administrator&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><b>What does a Database Administrator do?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A database administrator is like the gatekeeper of company data. They’re responsible for setting up new databases (Oracle, Microsoft SQL, etc.), data migration, database design, and protection. Database design includes the physical design of the database, the structure of the content within it and integrity controls such as who has access to it. It’s their responsibility to protect from unauthorized use of data, which is an issue of increasing importance.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database administrators are also responsible for creating backup systems and recovery plans for company data in the case of loss or damage. They need to monitor the performance of the database and tune it in a way that makes data easy to access. They should also understand the weaknesses of the database software they’re using in order to minimize any risk to the business by developing best practices.</span></p>



<p><b>What skills are needed?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, a general understanding of database structures is essential, but companies can also request more in-depth knowledge of their particular database software. Many job postings ask for proficiency in languages like Python and SQL as well as experience working with various database technologies. Interestingly, having strong communication skills is key. Companies are looking for candidates who can explain even the most technical aspect of their job to non-technical executives and employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Average U.S Salary:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $</span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Senior-Database-Administrator-Salaries"><span style="font-weight: 400;">109,311</span></a></p>



<p><b>Recommended BrainStation courses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science Bootcamp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python Programming</span></a></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Sales Engineer&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><b>What does a Tech Sales Engineer do?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Sales Engineers are pretty much like your standard Sales Reps in that they need to understand and communicate the value and in-workings of a product to a degree where they can convince someone to pay money for it. The main difference between the two is that Tech Sales Engineers are selling more complex and technical products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for Tech Sales Engineers is growing as quickly as innovative products are being built and launched. Someone has to help sell all these products! These sales folks require a deeper understanding of product usage, specifications, and special requirements. They need to be able to speak the language of the customer </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the engineering team.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this unique position of having one foot inside the company and one foot out, they have the potential to have a direct impact on shaping product features and recommending new ones.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>What skills are needed?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, you need to feel comfortable hanging out with customers and engineers alike (ie. having a grasp on programming languages). You’ll often have to put your user research hat on in order to fully assess customer needs and to provide the best service possible. Naturally, you’ll have to develop sales reports and presentations, but you should also ensure the product is evolving to meet customer needs by feeding into the development cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Average U.S Salary:</b> <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/sales-engineer-Salaries"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$103,725</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (+ bonus)&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Recommended BrainStation courses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/intro-to-web-development"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Development Course,</span></a> <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience Design&nbsp;</span></a></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity Engineer&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><b>What does a Cybersecurity Engineer do?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a Database Administrator is the gatekeeper of data, then a Cybersecurity Engineer is its bodyguard. A Cybersecurity Engineer is responsible for ensuring that a company is protected against cyberattacks and data breaches by designing, developing, testing, and implementing secure network solutions.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re also the ones responsible for creating company protocol such as a playbook for what to do in case of an incident in order to minimize the impact on the business. Cybersecurity Engineers need to be aware of any vulnerabilities in the company’s systems or networks and they find these by performing penetration testing.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2019 study on the state of cybersecurity, 69 percent of </span><a href="https://www.isaca.org/info/state-of-cybersecurity-2019/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cyber professionals say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that their teams are understaffed and that it typically takes over six months to find a qualified candidate.</span></p>



<p><b>What skills are needed?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to detect and deter cyber threats, Cybersecurity Engineers must have a basic understanding of programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, C and C++. They also need to have an understanding of technology infrastructure and security concepts. Some postings ask for specific cybersecurity certifications.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most importantly, to be able to proactively safeguard against hackers, you need to be able to show that you can think like one.</span></p>



<p><b>Average U.S Salary:</b> <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Cyber-Security-Engineer-Salary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$120,249</span></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the competition to discover and lure top tech talent heats up, some of the world’s top tech companies have found great success by rethinking a longtime requirement in their search for skilled workers: the college degree.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/degree-problem-you-can-still-land-jobs-top-companies-joseph-milord/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found a number of leading companies have ditched their requirements for a four-year college degree, including Google, Apple, IBM, Nordstrom, Costco and Bank of America. That’s in line with recommendations from experts like those at the Harvard Business Review, which declared in 2017 that “competency is more important than credentials” and warned of how degree requirements could threaten the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, a bachelor’s degree is no longer a barrier for entry to work at the world’s top companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world, those are exceptional human beings,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google’s former senior vice-president of people operations, Laszlo Bock. “And we should do everything we can to find those people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why has there been such a dramatic shift in educational expectations? Here are some of the reasons tech workers no longer need a college degree to thrive in their field. </span></p>
<h2><b>It’s All About Skills</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an influential 2016 letter to U.S. President Donald Trump, IBM President and CEO Ginni Rometty described the rise of “new collar” jobs and the shifting skills requirements to excel in those positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, IBM’s vice-president of talent Joanna Daley told </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/why-ibm-wants-to-hire-employees-who-dont-have-a-4-year-college-degree.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC Make It</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that about 15 percent of her company’s U.S. hires don’t have a four-year degree and that the tech company now looks at candidates who have hands-on experience through bootcamps or industry-related vocational classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Getting a job at today’s IBM does not always require a college degree; at some of our centers in the United States, as many as one-third of employees have less than a four-year degree. What matters most is relevant skills, sometimes obtained through vocational training,” Rometty </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-letter-u-s-president-elect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition, we are creating and hiring to fill ‘new collar’ jobs – entirely new roles in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, and cognitive business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excelling in positions such as those often requires highly specialized training that is in line with the absolute latest industry trends, which isn’t necessarily a strength of large colleges with rigid four-year curriculums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, HackerRank’s annual survey of student developers attending college found that only 32 percent reported learning to code in school, with 27 percent saying they were self-taught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More businesses should overhaul their outdated practices and stop pretending that when it comes to the skills they need in employees, there’s any correlation between a degree from one of the nation’s elite schools and high performance,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/college-degree-requirements-upwork/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains why a LinkedIn study found that companies including Apple, Oracle, and Google often ask either for a degree or “equivalent practical experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The four-year degree isn’t gone altogether but we’re starting to see a shift in what these companies are looking for,” </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-dont-need-a-4-year-college-degree-for-these-high-paying-jobs-at-google-apple-netflix-2019-04-08"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Laura Lorenzetti, editor at LinkedIn. “There’s a growing emphasis on skills over school as they compete for top talent. People still see the four-year degree as a signaling factor but companies are taking experience as seriously as a four-year degree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>A Tech Talent Shortage Has Employers Rethinking Their Priorities</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you have surely heard about the industry-wide– and ever-growing – </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/canadas-tech-talent-gap-increasing-the-value-of-digital-skills"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for tech talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that there are simply not enough skilled workers to meet it. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is forecasting the employment of computer and information technology professionals to grow by 13 percent by 2026 – faster than the average for all occupations. Meanwhile, a recent report from G2 Crowd found that 80.8 percent of employers reported that it’s more difficult to fill positions now compared to 2015, while 51 percent said that the difficulty owed to a lack of talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM has felt that crunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got a massive skills gap across the tech industry, so people with non-traditional backgrounds are really becoming valuable,” </span><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-you-dont-need-a-4year-degree-to-get-the-tech-job-of-your-dreams"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kelli Jordan, talent leader for IBM’s New Collar Initiatives program. “You don’t need to go get a computer science degree to be a web developer. You can learn those languages in a variety of ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, a phenomenon called “degree inflation” led to many companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requiring degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for jobs that had traditionally been filled by workers who didn’t have one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2014 report from Burning Glass Technologies looked at the scope of degree inflation by comparing the number of people in a certain occupation who have a degree to the number of job postings requiring one. The report found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs, 21 percent for computer and math jobs, and 13 percent for sales jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a glaring shortage of talent in tech, it would be self-defeating for companies to exclude so many skilled workers because they don’t have a credential that might not even be relevant to their job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For decades, at many companies that I worked for, I wasn’t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four-year degree,” </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/need-college-degree-get-job-these-companies-say-skills-matter-n1001526"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trish Torizzo, chief information officer for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which recently dropped its degree requirement for applicants.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Now) supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It Creates a More Inclusive Environment</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ottawa-based eCommerce giant Shopify has never demanded a college degree in its job postings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t require any background or a specific amount of experience in any specific field. Instead, we want someone who can make an impact,” </span><a href="https://www.canadianbusiness.com/work/want-a-job-in-canadian-tech-dont-worry-about-that-university-degree/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shopify’s director of talent acquisition Anna Lambert, who noted that after seven years – and 3,000 hires! – she has seen a major shift in the industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s less focus on experience and more on your ability to do the job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Lambert’s recruitment team includes someone who used to be a welder – a background she says is “very different, but somehow totally applicable.” She suggests that instead of asking prospective employees for a specific experience and deciding they aren’t qualified, try to make all people feel welcome and consider where their strengths might lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A more inclusive job posting will show that you know experience comes in all forms – and you want that,” Lambert said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a more open-minded approach to educational requirements could also help to reverse the tide of an ongoing crisis in tech: a lack of diversity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges in the U.S. and around the world continue to struggle with </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/can-people-like-me-go-to-college-inequality-and-dreams-of-higher-ed-73893"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inequality and a lack of diversity among their student populations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That mainly owes to economics; while </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cpa.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">83 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of students from high-income families in the U.S. enroll in college, only 63 percent from low- and middle-income families do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of what motivated Upwork to drop their degree requirements for new hires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly, four-year universities produce too few graduating classes that are reflective of the country’s racial, social, and economic diversity,” </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2019/06/06/college-degree-requirements-upwork/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel. “Because of their soaring fees, colleges are pricing themselves out of reach for many Americans. As a result, businesses are in danger of being walled off from huge sections of America’s talented pool.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who may be shunted to the margins of the labor market won’t be disqualified for lack of intelligence or skill, but because they simply can’t afford to pay for school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a 2017 research project from the Harvard Business School determined that employers “appear to be closing off their access to the two-thirds of the U.S. workforce that does not have a four-year college degree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is only getting worse as college becomes more out-of-reach for many Americans; average annual tuition costs at four-year universities more than doubled between the 1985-86 and 2015-16 academic years, from $12,052 to $26,120 after adjusting to inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If education becomes unaffordable for most and companies continue to require college degrees, we’ll perpetuate a system by which those companies will only hire from a relatively small and privileged group of graduates,” Kasriel said. “That makes no business sense for a country that’s already suffering from a painful lack of know-how in many crucial tech sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also isn’t fitting for a country known as the land of opportunity.”</span></p>
<h2><b>A Lack of Value</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both employers and workers alike are complaining that the four-year college degree isn’t necessarily bringing an adequate return on investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve covered the high costs of a college education already, and the results aren’t necessarily always there. According to the 2018 Freelancing in America survey, 93 percent of freelancers with a four-year college degree said skills training was useful for the work they currently did, compared to only 79 percent who said their college education was useful.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 DigitalOcean survey found that bootcamp grads heading into a software engineering position felt “much better prepared for the real world” than four-year college grads, by a margin of 61 percent to 36 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that perceived lack of value goes both ways. From an employer’s perspective, Harvard’s report found that degree-holders command an 11-to-30 percent wage premium, but fail to justify that premium in productivity or other outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the report found that college graduates filling these positions “are costing companies more money to employ, tend to be less engaged in their jobs, have a higher turnover rate, and reach productivity levels only on par with high school graduates doing the same job.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It Can Improve the Lives of Their Workers</b><b><br />
</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there are plenty of great reasons to pursue a college education. But getting a degree only because it seems like a prerequisite to finding a job isn’t one, and crushing student debt is taking a huge toll on the American workforce.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, 44.2 million Americans are now carrying student loan debt, and those Americans owe more than $1.48 trillion collectively – roughly $620 billion more than total U.S. credit card debt. Research from Citizens Financial Group showed that 60 percent of student debt borrowers can expect to pay off their loans in their 40s, while another </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8LurBVUNQZfQVhYZWZvamlfd00/view"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that Wisconsin university graduates take on average 19.7 years to pay off a bachelor’s degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While tech companies compete to offer their employees the best packages of benefits and perks, there’s certainly something to be said for a workforce who aren’t buried under a pile of debt.</span></p>
<h2><b>Follow the Leader</b><b> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry trends often start at the top, and when it comes to loosening or dropping degree demands – to put it simply – all the biggest companies seem to be doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, a recent LinkedIn study showed that many of the companies listed among its 2019 LinkedIn Top Companies in the U.S. no longer require a degree, including Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Netflix, Airbnb, Facebook, Oracle, Dell, and, of course, Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that about half of Apple’s U.S. employment in 2018 was made up of people who didn’t have a four-year degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stressed instead the need for certain in-demand skills; in Apple’s case, that skill is coding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we’ve looked at the…mismatch between the skills that are coming out of colleges and what the skills are that we believe we need in the future, and many other businesses do, we’ve identified coding as a very key one,” he </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-why-college-degree-isnt-necessary-2019-3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainly makes sense given that Apple’s Steve Jobs famously founded the company after dropping out of college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our company, as you know, was founded by a college drop-out,” Cook </span><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftop-companies-are-hiring-more-candidates-without-a-4-year-degree-2019-4&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fdegree-problem-you-can-still-land-jobs-top-companies-joseph-milord%2F&amp;xguid=67b5964b3e61ef97c1d7513af1846f14&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=30439db150c9a1425c3c997e96b18423"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “So we’ve never really thought that a college degree was the thing that you had to do well. We’ve always tried to expand our horizons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Jobs wasn’t the only tech trailblazer who didn’t hold a degree. The same could be said of Uber’s Travis Kalanick, Dell’s Michael Dell, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, and Whatsapp’s Jan Koum.</span></p>
