								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, companies both large and small are realizing that web analytics are an essential tool in optimizing their digital offerings, understanding their users, and utilizing data-driven decision making to stand above the competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, most companies also feel they could do even more to capitalize on the world of information now at their fingertips. A 2018 digital trends </span><a href="https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/modal-offers/pdfs/0060629.en.aec.whitepaper.econsultancy-2018-digital-trends-US.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Adobe and Econsultancy found web analytics to be one of the top priorities for companies, with 51 percent of respondents indicating plans to increase their analytics budgets for 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are these companies focusing on analytics? At a high level, web analytics: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can identify how people are finding your website</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide granular data on customer behavior</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give you the data needed to make informed decisions</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at how you can use web analytics to grow your business. </span></p>
<p><b>Determine a Measurement Plan</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start on this journey into web analytics, you had better know your destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer amount of data and information available can be overwhelming instead of empowering if you don’t think first about your digital marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, define your key performance indicators (KPIs), then create a plan to implement your tracking, and finally determine how – and how often – to handle reporting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A measurement plan is key,” said Trevor Martin, Manager of SEO for BrainStation. “That will help you set up your own goals for your business, and determine what actions will help you achieve those goals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As just one example, the public TV broadcaster PBS recently embarked upon a </span><a href="http://www.lunametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PBS-Case-Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a focused goal. They wanted to allow the producers of each TV program to see only their show’s performance, and to track such key site elements as registrations and video views. As a result of the campaign, PBS managed a 30 percent increase in traffic, a 30 percent boost in registered users, and the broadcaster created two new video portals based on newly discovered demand.</span></p>
<p><b>Setting Up Goals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a roadmap for your analytic exploration, it’s time to </span><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032415?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6150889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to measure whether you’re meeting – or missing – your target objectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A goal is a completed activity – or conversion – that helps your business, whether it’s a customer purchasing a product or a user filling out a contact information form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals can be divided into four types: destination, where a user visits a certain location; duration, which seeks to keep user sessions lasting beyond a specific amount of time; pages/screens per session; and event, where a user employs a very specific interaction (for instance, an ad click or a social-media share). There’s also a fifth conversion tracking method called </span><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6153083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which automatically assesses your website and determine which visits are the most valuable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to dive deeper with your goals, Google has tutorials to help you set up </span><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2976313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flow and Funnel reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which provide more information about the user journey), to manage </span><a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/06/ga-advocate-justin-cutroni-answers-your.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal sets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and to understand </span><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1012040?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6150889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best practices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for assigning goal values.</span></p>
<p><b>Segments, Audiences, and Customer Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segments allow you to divide the mass of visitors to your website into smaller groups, giving you a deeper look at underlying demographic trends in your users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, one segment could look at people of a specific age, gender or geographic location, or you could congregate a group of users who visited a specific page on your site or who purchased a specific product. Up to four segments can be applied at once and you can compare the data side by side. You can also </span><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3124493?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3123779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build new segments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best applications for isolating subsets of your data is using those segments to build and analyze potential remarketing audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are the users you want to target with AdWords campaigns based on their likelihood to convert, based on their past behaviour on your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Google’s </span><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6379332?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Match</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool lets you use your online and offline data to get in touch with customers across platforms including Gmail and YouTube with advertising campaigns based on the information you already have about their consumer habits.</span></p>
<p><b>Google Tag Manager, UTM Codes, and Google AdWords</b></p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Tag Manager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will let you efficiently update tracking codes on your website and organize them into containers, which is especially helpful for smaller companies who don’t have a developer on-hand to continually make changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, UTM codes – a brief snippet of code added to the end of a URL – allow you to find out more about how users found your website. UTM codes can help you appraise the effectiveness of your digital strategies, as well as identify opportunities to better leverage certain channels for more traffic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it’s definitely worth linking your <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/google-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wplink-edit="true">Google Analytics</a> and Google AdWords accounts, so you can gain a clearer view of the ROI of your advertising and give you a better understanding of your conversion funnel.</span></p>
<p><b>Dashboards, Data reporting, and Decisions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating custom </span><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1068216?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will allow you to probe multiple metrics at once, compare reports or share your findings with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data reporting is an art unto itself, with data visualization tools – including </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-tableau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tableau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – allowing you to take your raw data and tell meaningful stories about your company’s digital offerings that can empower your employees and effect change in your organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s important because, ultimately, all of the information you’re gathering about your business is only valuable if it informs what you do next. Adopting data-driven decision making is therefore the most crucial part of the entire process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, once stakeholders begin to see web analytics at work, most are excited by the opportunity to act upon the lessons in the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people don’t fully understand it until they actually see it in action,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, once they realize that the data is there and that it’s shedding light on their business and revenue, all of a sudden they realize how important data-driven decision making is.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of available search engine optimization (SEO) jobs increased by 43 percent this year, with search marketing experience among LinkedIn’s most in-demand skills for 2018 and beyond. It’s not hard to see why: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 93% of online experiences begin with a search engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help meet this demand, BrainStation is now offering <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/search-engine-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search Engine Optimization training</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;both online and at our campuses in New York, Toronto and Vancouver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re still unsure whether that further education would benefit you, read on for a few reasons why SEO training could be valuable for you.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO Skills are Increasingly Important</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as the SEO and SEM fields have changed, their importance has only grown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://www.advancedwebranking.com/ctrstudy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all web searches in May 2018 found that the click-through rate for the top-ranking search result was just under 30 percent – a number that plummeted to four percent for the fifth-ranked result. By the ninth result, a meagre one percent of searchers on average were still interested in clicking through – a far more dramatic drop-off than was observed just a few years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Internet users are simply searching more frequently. The number of core search queries from the top four search engines in the United States in April 2018 was </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265796/us-search-engines-ranked-by-number-of-core-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">17.6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – up dramatically from the 10.12 billion who searched in April 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not surprising, then, that businesses are finding lucrative ROIs investing in SEO and SEM. According to a BIA/Kelsey Local Commerce Monitor </span><a href="http://www.biakelsey.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/the-state-of-seo-boostability-sponsored-webinar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, companies spending more than $25,000 a year on marketing reported that search engine marketing and optimization provided the best return on investment, with 65.9 percent listing SEM/SEO as an extremely high priority or very high priority going forward – above email marketing, social media advertising or performance assessment.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Other Engines Don’t Rest</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of 2017, Google made a series of updates to its search algorithm – some minor, some relatively major.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the alterations made, two big updates in February and March seemed to target low-value content, a December update was intended to “improve relevancy,” while in March 2018 Google confirmed a “broad core algorithm update” intended to “benefit pages that were previously under-rewarded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common trend among Google’s algorithm updates is that they seem to be prioritizing quality over quantity. Experts have also observed that Google appears to be placing a greater emphasis on website architecture and internal linking strategy. Further, sculpting – or editing away the needless bulk on your website – is a process that is becoming </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/925985471083229184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly important</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the rise of voice search is already having a transformational effect, with Google revealing in 2016 that 20 percent of queries through its platform were voice searches. Another trend that has developed at lightning speed is the sudden prominence of </span><a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/featured-snippets-new-Insights-new-opportunities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rich snippets and knowledge boxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, features that are already having a game-changing effect for SEO specialists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And most professionals are readying themselves for a larger-scale shift to mobile, given that Google has already confirmed that more than 50 percent of searches are conducted on mobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it should be clear an SEO strategy that worked well just a few years ago might already be hopelessly outdated. Refreshing your SEO skills could be crucial in staying on top of an endlessly evolving field.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not Just for SEO Specialists Anymore</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, even if “SEO” isn’t in your job title, you will likely be expected to have a firm grasp on optimizing your website to search-engine prominence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quick sweep of job-search websites will find that an understanding of SEO is considered a major advantage or even a prerequisite for jobs in many fields, including </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=communications+AND+SEO&amp;l=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">communications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=content+AND+SEO&amp;l=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">content creation and management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=marketing+AND+SEO&amp;l=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=social+media+AND+SEO&amp;l=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and some positions in </span><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=SEO+editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">journalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In BrainStation’s SEO courses, students learn the techniques and tools to create real-world search marketing strategies, with units covering: SEM; SEO, site crawling, on-page optimization and answer boxes; Google Search Console, rich snippets and data highlighter; pay-per-click advertising, ad groups and remarketing; and Google Analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you’re not planning on specializing in SEO and SEM Analytics, it’s clearly a competency that is valued.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Can be Hard to Stand Out From the Crowd</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As important as SEO professionals are, they also tend to be relatively inexperienced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/CA/Job=Search_Engine_Optimization_(SEO)_Specialist/Salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayScale.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 67 percent of SEO specialists have four years or less experience in the field, and 93 percent have worked less than 10 years. If you’re new to the field, you might not be as far behind as you thought. And with so many professionals boasting such a comparable amount of experience, pursuing a certificate is a great way to nudge ahead of the pack.</span></p>

<p>Find out why she&#8217;s enrolled in the online SEO/SEM/Analytics course, and what she hopes to gain out of learning with us.</p>
<p><b>BrainStation: Which course are you taking with us? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheryl: Online SEO/SEM and Analytics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b><br />
</b><b>What led you to take a course at BrainStation?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard about Brainstation last year from a friend who was interested in the User Experience Design course. We both ended up taking that part-time course and it was a reminder of how much I enjoy the web aspect of my job and how taking a course online gives me the flexibility to learn from anywhere. </span></p>
<p><b>What is your education and career background? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Graphic Design for Marketing | Graphic Designer and Marketing Coordinator. I am currently working full time as an in-house Graphic Designer/Marketing Coordinator in Vancouver. </span></p>
<p><b>Why are you taking this course? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a much better understanding of SEO, SEM, PPC, and Analytics. I&#8217;ve been self-taught with Google Analytics and I feel that I&#8217;ve only touched the surface of what there is to learn.</span></p>
<p><b>What aspects of the course are you most interested in? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m really interested in PPC and Remarketing. We currently contract a company to do this for us and its new territory for me. I would love to get a better understanding of how they both work and gain the confidence to do it on my own.</span></p>
<p><b>What gave you the push to invest in your career potential?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working closely with the company we&#8217;ve contracted to do our digital marketing really spiked my interest in how it all works. How do you find the appropriate keywords, how do you know they&#8217;re working, how do you know which group to target, how do you adjust your targeting if it isn&#8217;t working, how much do you spend on an ad, how do you choose your budget, etc. are just a few of the questions I have that have really given me motivation to learn more and take this course online. </span></p>
<p><b>Where do you see yourself after completing the course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing this online course, I see myself utilizing the knowledge I&#8217;ve gained and applying it to my work. I&#8217;m extremely excited to get started!</span></p>

Learn why Jan chose to learn online with us, and how he stayed engage and motivated in our online live lecture class.</p>
<h3 class="p1"></h3>
<h3 class="p1"></h3>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>Q/A</strong></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What were you doing before the course?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was working for my family-owned company, CompCare Solutions in Winnipeg. I had to manage the finance, operations and marketing side of the healthcare agency.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>What led you to BrainStation?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I value continuous learning, so I wanted to complement my MBA focused on brand management with something that is specific and current. I have the marketing knowledge but I was seeking the technical knowledge of how to promote the family business digitally. The SEO/SEM class seemed like the great option of what I was looking for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>What led you to enroll in a course at BrainStation?</strong></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I was at the point of shifting my career from a financial role to marketing focused role so I wanted this extra boost of skills as I embarked this journey. Also, a friend had taken a course in class at BrainStation that reinforced my decision to enroll.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><strong>What were your feelings going into it on day one?</strong> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"> I was excited as I definitely enjoy learning. The setting is particularly different as well considering it was online. So, I was also asking myself how you can learn hands-on virtually.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><strong>What was your experience like in class, with your instructors and with the content?</strong></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The class was interactive, considering it was online. The instructors were knowledgeable and had the experience to back up what they were talking about. For someone that already has the knowledge on the content, it was pretty straightforward so I appreciated the hands-on experience and technical knowledge gained more in the class. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><strong><span class="s1">How did the course impact you in your current role?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The course was impactful as it definitely provided an added confidence on my career shift and gave me a better understanding of the digital environment. My long-term goal of setting up my own business focused on e-commerce has been realized already, so learning how to navigate Google Analytics as an example, was definitely handy. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><strong><span class="s1">What is your current title, place of work and what do you do on a day-to-day?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The adventurous me is now embarking a career in Montreal. I am currently an Independent Contractor for few companies/start-ups in varying projects. One of which, I do content strategy and SEO for an events/activity app. As well, I do bookkeeping and payroll for some businesses as I can&#8217;t get rid of my financial side just yet. On top of that, I am the CEO/Co-Founder of LetsGoShopNow.com, an internet/e-commerce company. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><strong><span class="s1">Would you recommend this program to others?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1">Yes, certainly! I recommend the online course as it definitely gives you all the tools a traditional classroom also have, so you are not missing out on the experience. I appreciated the fact that after a long busy day at work, I can just learn from the comfort of where I am. Also, as a professional who&#8217;s interested working within the digital environment it is inevitable that you would be working with people remotely. The class at BrainStation online provides you this setting and experience just like in the real world. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><strong><span class="s1">Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add about the experience?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">To make the most of the online experience, doing the hands-on learning while in class will definitely reinforce understanding the technical aspects of the course content. It is also beneficial that you try to create side projects as practice so you understand better.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The technology industry isn’t just for programmers and engineers — there are plenty of positions that don’t require a highly technical background or even coding skills.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most integral roles that fits this description is as a marketer. While engineers can toil away to create the hottest new app or software out there, they need a pro to promote it to ensure their target users get their hands on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing roles are nothing new — the traditional versions of this position have been around for decades. But if you’re a traditional marketer, it’s likely time to upgrade your skills by going digital. Digital marketing is a field that requires proficiencies in software and tools unique to the role — things like search engine optimization (SEO), Google Analytics, and social media marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s unpack the intricacies of this role and take a look at some of the necessary skills to snag a digital marketing role.</span></p>
<p><b>What is a Digital Marketer?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On its most fundamental level, digital marketing is simply the promotion of a brand or product through various forms of digital media. The places you’d expect a digital marketer to push their brand is on websites, email, social media, and even text messages. No digital mediums are off limits for these resourceful pros.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, digital marketers will create, deploy, manage, and track campaigns promoting specific products or brand initiatives. An example might include a digital marketer building and deploying a set of emails out to inactive users of an app to engage them with the brand. </span></p>
<p>Whatever their chosen channels for promotion and management, one of the most important responsibilities for digital marketers to monitor and analyze what initiatives are and aren’t working. Using tools like Google Analytics to monitor traffic and see what gets traction with targeted customer segments.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketers essentially engage and manage customer relationships across the aforementioned digital mediums. They work to communicate with customers and anticipate their needs and expectations. And this process of getting to know to target customers of their brand to ensure consistent and high-quality interactions and experiences. This helps build brand loyalty and build customer lifetime value.</span></p>
<p><b>Digital Marketing: The Essential Skills</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketers are known to wear many hats, particularly as more digital channels become integral in communicating with current and prospective customers.</span></p>
<p>They must master a multitude of skills and tools to keep up with the proliferation of these digital channels. In addition to some of the aforementioned tools, including search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), and Google Analytics for tracking purposes, digital marketers may need to familiarize themselves with a few other areas, including:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Social media marketing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Creating organic and paid posts to promote your product and/or brand on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Inbound marketing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drawing customers to your brand’s site with thought leadership pieces and content that delights prospective customers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Email marketing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sending updates, information, and nurturing past, present, and potential customers through campaigns sent directly to their email inboxes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Public relations:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Digital marketers also often have to help out with getting coverage from online publications (think blogs, online magazines and newspapers, podcasts, </span><b>etc.) in an effort to help raise brand awareness.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pay-per-click (PPC) ads:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Getting more potential customer eyeballs on your brand or website by paying a publisher or platform a fee for every time someone clicks on your ad.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these are just a few of the digital channels you may need to juggle on a regular basis, this isn’t an all-inclusive list. Being adaptable is one of the most important skills a digital marketer must possess, as new digital channels emerge on a regular basis and must be considered for inclusion in your brand’s overall marketing strategy.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>As a marketer, you must be a wearer of many hats.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you have a background in traditional mediums or more digital channels, marketers master a multitude of skills and tools. They must keep up with the proliferation of digital mediums and methods, including search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), event promotion and execution, copywriting for marketing materials, and many more.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Many Mediums of Digital Marketers: Why Marketers Should Use Analytics</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketers specifically may need to familiarize themselves with a few other areas, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Social media marketing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Creating organic and paid posts to promote your product and/or brand on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Inbound marketing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Drawing customers to your brand’s site with thought leadership pieces and content that delights prospective customers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Email marketing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sending updates, information, and nurturing past, present, and potential customers through campaigns sent directly to their email inboxes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Public relations:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Digital marketers also often have to help out with getting coverage from online publications (think blogs, online magazines and newspapers, podcasts, </span><b>etc.) in an effort to help raise brand awareness.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pay-per-click (PPC) ads:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Getting more potential customer eyeballs on your brand or website by paying a publisher or platform a fee for every time someone clicks on your ad.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all these channels that must be managed, how can marketers track their campaigns, monitor what efforts are getting traction, and make informed decisions? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/05/09/ten-ways-big-data-is-revolutionizing-marketing-and-sales/#5bb75366115e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report from Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Big Data is being used to optimize many marketing processes and drive better decision making, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Greater customer responsiveness.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to one Forrester study, business-to-consumer businesses are already using data to improve communications with customers. Almost half (44%) use big data and analytics to bolster responsiveness, and another 36% use data mining to glean customer insights to plan more relationship-driven strategies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reducing customer churn and boosting lifetime value. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/laxalt-fig1.jpg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by DataMeer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that marketing departments already use data to acquire more customers and keep them longer to decrease churn. This thereby increases revenue per customer and helps improve existing products. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Building more successful relationships. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies are using data to go deeper than looking at basic marketing campaign analytics — they’re using analytics to create a strong foundation for a better relationship. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sold on the idea of using data to make better decisions? Marketers, meet Google Analytics.</span></p>
<p><strong>Google Analytics: Using Data to Make Decisions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to monitoring your social media, email marketing, and content marketing performance, Google Analytics is a great tool for the modern marketer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics hooks up to your website, blog, and any subdomains (like landing pages) using a bit of code inserted into your site. The code links up to a digital dashboard that allows marketers to monitor how many visitors land on your site and dozens of other important metrics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, such a powerful tool can be daunting to use for a newbie. So, let’s dive into some of the most integral metrics GA can monitor to help you get the most return on your investment when it comes to your content and campaigns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Getting You Started: Google Analytics’ Metrics</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the availability of so many analytics in one platform, it might be overwhelming to make sense of which stats are significant for your efforts.</span></p>
<p>So, let’s start with a few of the basics. Marketers can track more superficial metrics like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sessions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique pageviews </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time on site</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bounce rates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Referral sources (what sites are sending you traffic)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of analytics give you a big-picture view of what pages on your site are getting the most visitors, how long people are spending on each page engaging with your content, and how quickly they’re leaving your site after landing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you dig deeper into Google Analytics’ capabilities, you can also establish campaigns with goals around your external marketing initiatives — or in Google’s words, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">use campaign tracking in Google Analytics to accurately track online advertising campaigns to your website, both from AdWords-generated campaigns as well as from other advertising sources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By setting up custom campaigns, you can track what initiatives are sending you the most qualified traffic, the best sales leads, and which are offering the best ROI — and adjust your marketing strategy accordingly.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major marketing strategies many companies undertake is to build brand recognition and awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does that mean exactly? Rather than using tactics that have a direct and immediate impact on sales, building brand awareness is more of a long-game strategy — it helps companies create a following and boost recognition amongst their target audience. Through brand awareness, their audience eventually associates their company with a specific product or service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, many of us in the general population thinks of tissues when someone mentions the Kleenex brand — that’s fantastic brand awareness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while building that kind of visibility may seem like a daunting task, one concrete way to increase your brand’s authority online and create more digital brand awareness is through <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/seo-sem-analytics#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_OptimizeSEO">search engine optimizatio</a>n (SEO). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While SEO is a complicated and in-depth strategy to tackle, brands who want to boost their online authority can use a few of the following tactics to start making an impact.</span></p>
<h2><b>Establish Your Specialty</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To boost your online visibility, it actually helps to create your topical expertise — then own it. Most industries these days are competitive. But specializing in a niche, and establishing that expertise online, can really help differentiate your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hyper-focused content that targets your niche better caters to your specific audience and allows them to connect better with your brand. For example, if you’re selling custom-designed dresses, you don’t want to target keyword phrases like “dresses” or “gowns” — you’d be better off targeting “custom dresses,” or a similar phrase. Do your research via tools like Google’s Keyword Planner tool to see what keyword phrases best match with your product or service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means you should clearly define your company’s identity to your audience with branded (and keyword optimized) content. That includes website content and blog posts that follow SEO best practices and speak to your audience. Also, try targeting keywords in every step of the selling cycle for your industry. While going after general keywords can help get new customers at the top of your sales funnel, ensure you’re addressing customer concerns and pain points at every stage of your sales/marketing funnel. Again, this helps build your brand authority and positions you as a leader in your industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>Embrace Link Building</b></h2>
<p>If you’ve ever dabbled in SEO best practices, you’ve likely heard of link building strategies.</p>
<p>While paid search is an important part of any SEO strategy, link building is an excellent way to build your visibility online through organic means. Essentially, that means that other trusted sites are linking to your site.</p>
<p>That could include links from bloggers and other company websites — which are indications of trust and authority to Google. You can ask to guest blog on other sites and link back to yours, or simply reach out to offer a link exchange.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to serving as an excellent organic brand-building exercise, link building on other sites is also a great way to tap into other relevant audiences. This provides additional brand awareness and drives more qualified traffic back to your site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish this, identify the top sites and publishers for topics in your industry (use a tool like <a href="https://www.linkio.com/">Linkio</a>, Alexa, or SEMRush), then engage them and participate in their communities. Offer to do a content swap, a guest post on their site, and leave comments that include links back to your site.</span></p>
<h2><b>Participate in Online Communities</b></h2>
<p>To create additional brand awareness, another effective tactic is to participate in online communities discussing topics relevant to your industry. Whether that’s the appropriate thread on Reddit, social media channels, GrowthHackers, and StumbleUpon.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with other members of your industry’s community again positions you as a trustworthy authority. It also increases your digital footprint and helps your visibility in search as you link to your brand’s site across social platforms and engage users on each site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are plenty of SEO tactics that can increase brand awareness, these aforementioned three strategies will help get you started.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve likely heard of SEO, and may even be following some best practices when it comes to creating content that helps your brand’s search rankings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While search engine optimization is a great way to build brand recognition and awareness, search engine marketing is the best way to stay top of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the stats don’t lie. According to </span><a href="http://scq.io/MjMgruVw#gs.4gzjxkI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 85% of retailers surveyed said search marketing (including paid and SEO) was the most effective customer acquisition tactic. And according to CMO.com, 70% of agencies predict client search budgets increased in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As demonstrated, more and more companies are undertaking more paid search engine marketing initiatives. Here’s why you should consider SEM for your brand.</span></p>
<p><b>What is SEM?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we move forward, let’s take a moment to establish the definition of search engine marketing. SEM experts Search Engine Land offer a robust explanation for novices new to this marketing tactic: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Search Engine Marketing’ was once was used as an umbrella term to encompass both </span><a href="http://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO (search engine optimization)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and paid search activities. Over time, the industry has adopted the </span><a href="http://searchengineland.com/does-sem-seo-cpc-still-add-up-37297"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEM acronym to refer solely to paid search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At Search Engine Land, we generally use </span><b>SEM</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or “</span><b>Paid Search</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to refer to paid listings, with the longer term of </span><a href="http://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-sem"><span style="font-weight: 400;">search marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used to encompass both SEO and SEM.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, while SEO and SEM activities are closely linked, the general sentiment across the tech industry is that SEM is relegated to paid search activities. Some of these kinds of campaigns might include:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid search ads </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid search advertising</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC (pay-per-click) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPC (cost-per-click) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while you may be familiar with the most common types of SEM campaigns, like Google AdWords campaigns, there are a wealth of options when it comes to build a robust SEM campaign to keep your brand top of mind in search rankings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to take the leap into SEM? Here are a few steps to help you get started.</span></p>
<p><b>Create Your Strategy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before creating your campaign, it’s wise to think ahead and plan out a cohesive strategy. Does it may sense for your brand to focus on paid search ads? Or do you want to tackle a more robust strategy that also includes PPC ads?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to define your target audience for your SEM strategy, and take a hard look at their needs. This will better inform what types of SEM initiatives will give you the best bang for your marketing bucks.</span></p>
<p><b>Complete a Competitive Analysis</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first steps in building your SEM campaign is taking a look at your competitors. What are they doing with their SEM strategy? What keywords are they targeting with their campaigns?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this competitive analysis and the information you compiled on your target audience to establish a high-impact keyword list for your company. Build a list of phrases that are most relevant to your business, that have a solid amount of search traffic, and would be used by your potential customers. You can also lean on keyword research tools like </span><a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3114286?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Adwords Keyword Planner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://www.afrefs.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahrefs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="http://wordtracker.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wordtracker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you to compile your list.</span></p>
<p><b>Build Your Campaign</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s time to pull the trigger on building your campaign. Bid on some of the relevant keywords from your list and ensure your campaign is appropriately tied to business results. While the campaign may be purchased as cost-per-click, you may want to measure your results from your SEM ads in terms of cost per lead or cost per sale to align with your business objectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve established your campaign and launched it, ensure you measure your success. Incorporate a post-mortem into your workflow to examine the results and takeaways to incorporate into your next SEM campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>Moving Forward</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are plenty of SEM tactics that can increase brand awareness, these aforementioned three strategies will help get you started.
