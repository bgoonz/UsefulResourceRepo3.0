								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are excited to announce that CourseCompare has named BrainStation the <a href="https://www.coursecompare.ca/best-coding-bootcamps/?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog_CourseCompare&amp;utm_campaign=WD_BestCodingBootcamp">Best Coding Bootcamp for 2021</a>.</p>



<p>CourseCompare is a leading marketplace for digital education, designed to help professionals identify and pursue the most in-demand job skills. Since 2018, CourseCompare has helped more than 500,000 people worldwide pursue new digital skills or launch new careers in business, technology, and design. </p>



<p>To compile its annual rankings for Best Coding Bootcamp, CourseCompare focused on job placement rates as a key metric, while also considering the following performance metrics:</p>



<ul><li>Verified ratings from recent graduates</li><li>Industry recognition and satisfaction from employer feedback</li><li>Graduate earning potential, based on salaries within six months of graduation</li><li>Graduation rates taken from a variety of regulatory sources</li></ul>



<p>“We interviewed bootcamp founders and recent graduates, pored over job placement data, took a deep dive into the curriculum, and toured campuses across the country to determine which coding bootcamps are truly delivering a positive return on investment (ROI) for their students in 2021,” CourseCompare noted on their website.</p>



<h2>What Sets BrainStation Apart</h2>



<p>According to CourseCompare, “BrainStation’s LMS (Learning Management System), Synapse, is among the most sophisticated on offer in Canada. The live online learning platform allows students to attend live lectures, collaborate with other professionals, and get immediate feedback from instructors — wherever they are.”</p>



<p>Professionals from over 90 countries have now taken courses and programs at BrainStation, and we continue to welcome and attract new professionals from around the world. In 2020, we met a surge in demand for online training by introducing over 350 new online live courses in multiple time zones.</p>

<h2>What Students Are Saying</h2>



<p>BrainStation’s team of 450 industry professionals has trained over 100,000 professionals around the world. We’re honored to have positively impacted the lives of professionals looking to contribute to the world through technology and innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few samples of alumni reviews from CourseCompare on BrainStation’s Web Development Bootcamp.</p>



<p>“I found the collaborative, hands-on teaching approach allowed me to learn in 12 weeks what would have taken me six months to a year.” &#8211; <strong>Jonny Caron</strong></p>



<p>“I took BrainStation&#8217;s Web Development course. I&#8217;m currently a UX Product Designer and thought it would be great to learn more about how my designs are actually coded and implemented by the team I work with&#8230;Both instructors were super knowledgeable and approachable in the online format, I frequently was able to get one-on-one time to answer questions…” &#8211; <strong>Amber Sewell</strong></p>



<p>“BrainStation has made me a more confident person and has helped me find what I really want to do with my career path. The culture in the classroom is unlike the culture I&#8217;ve experienced in traditional schooling &#8211; everyone is a lot more supportive of one another and not only focused on their own progression. I learned how to learn quickly and apply quickly &#8211; a lasting skill that will definitely be beneficial in the web dev industry in the long run.” &#8211; <strong>Jessica Kwok</strong></p>



<p>“I have nothing but the utmost respect for the entire BrainStation team and I cannot thank them enough for the most amazing educational experience I’ve ever had.” &#8211; <strong>Patrick Isaac</strong><br><br></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of Web Developers are committed to continuous learning. In fact, BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2020-results/development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that a massive 80 percent of Web Developers feel that digital skills training would make them more successful.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s plenty to suggest that Web Developers would be best-served by immersing themselves in the world of user experience design and </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2Nsg2md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few reasons why.</span></p>



<h2>Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you start to learn UX, you’re likely to find that you won’t have to stray too far from your comfort zone. In fact, the biggest benefit of learning UX might be how organically it relates to your existing experience as a Developer.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although UX design spans many more platforms than the trusty browser, web design is of course still a massive part of the job; in fact, BrainStation’s survey found that 74 percent of UX design respondents are designing for the web.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your knack for elegant aesthetics – and the mastery of typography, color, illustration, and imagery – will be highly valued within the UX sphere, as well as your ability to code and conduct some level of testing and research (though, as we’ll cover, you’re about to push deeper into that area than ever before).</span></p>



<h2><b>You’ll Become a Better Developer</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User experience spans every single interaction that users have with a product. While we did point out that there’s a significant overlap between the roles, there’s simply no denying that a UX Designer has to look at products with a broader scope.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UX Designer must juggle a huge number of considerations – including visual design, user research, content strategy, usability and accessibility, information architecture, and overall business goals – while also knowing how to effectively steer a project and communicate findings to a broad array of stakeholders.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to differentiate might be to say that Web Developers are motivated by solving problems for their clients, while UX Designers solve problems for their users. UX Designers, like Developers, concern themselves with the look, feel, and usability of a product or experience, but they also have to balance those considerations with a bevy of other priorities, including broader business goals.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Web Developers are likely already involved with designing, prototyping and testing their products, but learning the more thorough iterative UX design process can be illuminating.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UX Designer usually begins by identifying a problem, before becoming immersed in research – spanning user interviews, experience maps, Task Flows, analytic observations, demographic studies, or custom-drafted personas – to understand the behavior, needs, and frustration points of users. Building from those observations, the UX Designer then creates prototypes and wireframes before subjecting their design to a rigorous loop of building, testing, improving, and re-testing.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few positions in web development offer the opportunity to become well-versed in all of those areas, but certainly, any Web Developer would benefit from having a more holistic understanding of the products they’re creating and how users are interacting with them.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today&#8217;s digital products are less about ‘can technology do this’ and more about ‘how well can we do this?’” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-a-web-developer-take-a-UX-or-UI-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fahd Arshad, UX Strategist with Bloomberg.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UX as a process, as a set of tools, and as a frame of mind for product development is a huge part of this equation. Hence any Web Developer would find it worth their time to take a formal course in UX. Either they will be better partners later on for UX specialists or have the opportunity to introduce design thinking to their team, radically improving the chances of their collective success.”</span></p>



<h2>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/will-ai-replace-web-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Web Developers shouldn’t fear the rise of automation, but instead, embrace the ways in which AI and machine learning can help perform their jobs more efficiently and invest further in the skills that can’t be adequately replicated by a robot.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those skills and qualities include:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Empathy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the core principle of UX Design is understanding what people want and designing products with that in mind.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: possessing a better understanding of the end-to-end product lifecycle will allow Developers to communicate intelligently with a broad array of people inside and outside of their team. “This will reduce the ‘wall’ between Designers and (Developers) for them to be able to work together seamlessly and effectively,” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-a-web-developer-take-a-UX-or-UI-course"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Joseph Vedua, Principal UX Designer at Infor Hook &amp; Loop.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Prototyping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: though many Developers will have some level of experience with prototyping, it’s not quite the same in a UX context; BrainStation’s survey found that on a day-to-day basis, 52.1 percent of Designers focused most of their time on prototyping.</span></li></ul>



<h2>Ux Designers Are Among the Most Sought-after Specialists in Tech</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t heard, talented UX Designers are hard to find – and harder to hire.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;UX Designer as the fifth-most in-demand role in tech, remarkable given that many companies are still lagging way behind in shifting the appropriate amount of attention to user experience.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly, there’s a huge gap between businesses that embrace UX strategies and those that don’t,” </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/01/23/how-ux-is-transforming-business-whether-you-want-it-to-or-not/#2e2504b0580e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Andrew Kucheriavy, founder and CEO of Intechnic. “In fact, it can be the difference between surviving or drowning.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It follows then that an Adobe study canvassing 500 managers and department heads in UX design found that 87 percent of managers said hiring more UX Designers was their organization’s top priority and 73 percent vowed to hire more UX Designers over the next five years.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it also makes sense that those with UX skills are being rewarded handsomely for that expertise. According to Indeed, UX Designers bring home an average salary of $89,250 compared to $74,450 for Web Developers.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t have a career change in mind, there’s something else to consider when it comes to the shortage in UX skills: if your company doesn’t have any or enough UX Designers, gaining that skillset could make you indispensable at the office.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Knowing what makes a good user experience would definitely make you a better developer. I think it’s important for Front-End (Developers) to know this, especially since many times companies don’t have UX Designers working on projects,” </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/Should-a-web-developer-take-a-UX-or-UI-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ana Vasquez, UI/UX Designer at Mobomo.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are the one making these decisions, and it will make the product better for users.”</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With every advancement in artificial intelligence, more people begin to worry: are robots coming for my job? And certainly, Web Developers are among those most concerned about being replaced by AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/development"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 78 percent of Developers believe that AI and machine learning are the trends that would have the most impact on development over the next five to 10 years. Meanwhile, when Evans Data Corp </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">polled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 550 Developers on the most worrying aspects of their career, 29 percent – the most common response – were anxious about being replaced by AI</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps that concern stems from the rise in popularity of AI-integrated website-building tools like Squarespace, Adobe Sensei, Bookmark, Firedrop, and Wix’s ADI, or from pessimistic studies like one from Oxford that forecast a 21 percent probability that the work of Web Developers could someday be automated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are few who doubt that AI will change the work of Web Developers. But instead of seeing AI as a threat to replace Developers, many experts in the field, in fact, see artificial intelligence as a powerful tool that is making a Developer’s day-to-day work life easier and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see AI as a tool that will augment and enrich a Web Developer’s arsenal, rather than stealing their job,” said BrainStation Instructor Dan O’Donnell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Broadly speaking, AI is great at replacing humans in tasks that allow ‘fuzzy’ outcomes where there is either no right answer, or it’s OK to get the wrong answer some of the time. On the other hand, where it is business-critical that things work as predictably as possible, discrete instructions written by human beings will continue to be the way to go.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Can AI Work on Design?&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital design is widely viewed as too crucial a factor to leave up to AI Even beyond the myriad brand ramifications of bad design, a recent Vistaprint survey found that 42 percent of customers would be not very likely and 21 percent would be not likely at all to make a purchase from a website that they found to be poorly designed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And some early forays into AI-designed websites didn’t inspire confidence. The CMS the Grid launched with significant hype, millions in VC funding and major promises, but when the design community began unearthing real-world examples of websites built with the platform, their reaction was </span><a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/65265-the-first-gridio-sites-have-surfaced-and-theyre-kinda-terrible"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mixed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and now, some in the community wonder if the site-builder </span><a href="https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/what-happened-to-the-grid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still exists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as other website builders like Wix and Squarespace have risen in popularity and sophistication, those tools and other trained models can’t quite replicate the work of a talented front-end developer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trained AI models can certainly learn to produce beautiful and functional web layouts and even auto-generate robust code behind them. For a quick-and-easy website, this may be sufficient,” O’Donnell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if a designer wishes to make some very specific changes, or if something doesn&#8217;t look quite right on a particular screen, a human Developer will likely have to step in and re-code some or all of that layout manually. A similar argument can be made as to why front-end focused Developers have not been replaced by the likes of Wix or Squarespace.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Back-End Development Needs a Human Touch</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the server-side, too, a human touch is needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Back-end web development involves writing robust, bug-free code that performs discrete business-critical tasks like updating a user&#8217;s database record or processing a credit card transaction. These tasks need to be prescribed, reliable and repeatable; for these reasons, it is unlikely we&#8217;ll see many tech companies replacing their Web Developers and the code they write with AI models any time soon,” O’Donnell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that isn’t to say that AI doesn’t have a prominent place in the future of web development and design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Silka Miesnieks, Adobe’s Head of Emerging Design, </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2018/03/07/design-artificial-intelligence-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “In most cases, AI only affects a percentage of a job a person does, but rarely the whole job. And if you free up workers to do more of the creative and other work they are good at, while leaving other tasks for AI, you can grow your organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, AI has the power to handle some of the banal, time-consuming tasks that waste Developers’ time on a daily basis. AI can save time by updating database records, performing simple image editing jobs, automatically adding numbers, and creating predictive coding to solve glitches, to name merely a few examples. According to a recent Capgemini’s 2018-19 World Quality Report, 57 percent of respondents also reported using AI for quality assurance and testing.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other AI-driven innovations that are making the lives of web developers easier include Sketch2Code, which transforms hand-drawn designs into HTML, while Adobe Sensei uses AI and machine learning to help you unearth opportunities, offer personalized experiences, and speed up a number of time-consuming processes, including the ability to automatically add image descriptors, to score image quality on professional dimensions, and to automatically crop and mask images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And website builders can be a good tool even if a human touch is ultimately required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reliability and predictability are big parts of web development, but there are also a number of more subjective areas where AI can make a significant impact. As an example, a lot of great AI work is being done at the interface of web development and web design,” O’Donnell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if a human Developer is required to fine-tune things, AI can certainly help minimize time and effort by taking care of the broad strokes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even on the server-side, AI can certainly play a role,” he added. “Back-end development still has a number of more subjective operational tasks most humans would happily give away to a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tasks, O’Donnell explains, include inspecting error logs, analyzing performance data, or even identifying what coding styles are likely to produce the most bugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AI-driven advances in these areas will help web developers focus more on the task they enjoy doing most – writing code,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure why that kind of training is right for you, h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ere are a few reasons why a Web Development certificate is worth it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Web Developers are Highly Sought After</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve recently discussed, there’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-theres-never-been-a-better-time-to-be-a-web-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">never been a better time to be a Web Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report from Indeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that front-end developers were the second hardest-to-fill job in tech, with full-stack developers coming in at the fourth-most difficult to find. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In today’s world of digital business, such talent is clearly essential to many employers,” concluded the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those findings have been consistent across any number of labor forecasts. The U.S. Bureau of Labor reported that the job market for web developers is expected to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grow another 15 percent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026, while Mondo’s annual Tech and Digital Marketing Salary guide also found that “Web Developer” was the most in-demand job title in all of digital marketing, as well as one of the top-paying titles in tech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to understand why Web Developers are in such industry-wide demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, eCommerce/digital influences up to 56 percent of in-store purchases and now represents nearly 10 percent of all U.S. retail sales – a figure that is growing by 15 percent annually, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolunet found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is eCommerce rapidly becoming a point of focus for all businesses, but mobile-specific eCommerce is growing at a breakneck pace – Absolunet predicts mobile will reach 70 percent of eCommerce traffic by the end of 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And mobile transformations more generally still represent a huge challenge for slow-to-adapt companies. Mobile now represents 53 percent of all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">worldwide traffic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – as opposed to 43 percent on desktop – and as the scales continue to shift, companies around the world will have to reconsider their digital strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Developers, of course, will be a crucial part of that process.</span></p>
<h2><b>Developer Salaries Are Going Up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average salary for Web Developers in the United States is $71,531 according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with Senior Developers averaging $95,325. If you want to know more about Developer salaries, Developers For Hire did a much deeper dive and found <a href="https://www.developersforhire.com/web-developer-salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer salary ranges</a> by specialization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those numbers should trend upward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TEKsystems’ annual IT Forecast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found both that Web Developers/Software Engineers were hardest jobs to fill, and also the second-most likely job category to see their salaries rise over the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In part, this could owe to the fact that employers are figuring out that they can increase salaries now or pay the price later. A recent report from the market research firm </span><a href="https://go.forrester.com/research/predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forrester</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicted that employers who were slow to attract critical digital talent would wind up paying up to 20 percent above market salary rates for in-demand talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over four years, I’ve seen a roughly 25 to 30 percent increase in Web Developer salaries,” said Andrew Carlson, Digital Talent Recruiter at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planet4iT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Toronto. “It’s not even just salaries but in contract rates. A lot of really good Web Developers will end up switching to being self-employed contractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To give you numbers, I used to see full-stack developers charging $50 to 60 an hour – now, it’s not uncommon to see roles that are $75 to 100 per hour. That area has definitely grown.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Employers are Emphasizing Continuing Education</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For newcomers to Web Development, a certification course will give you all the tools you need to hit the ground running in this quickly developing field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation’s innovative curriculum helps students establish a solid foundation with HTML and CSS, before moving on to areas including Bootstrap, Visual Studio Code, React, server-side programming and responsive design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not just neophytes who can benefit from a Web Development certification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how rapidly tech is evolving – and beyond the shift to mobile, companies will soon also have to optimize their websites for voice searches, photo-based shopping, and app ordering – it’s crucial for tech talent to evolve at the same pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IT research firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foote Partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that a single tech certification raises base salary by an average of 7.6 percent. Employers are obviously in agreement over their value; according to the TEKsystems report, 90 percent of IT leaders said they either planned to increase or maintain spending on training and personal development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like in that field more than many others, the pace of change happens so rapidly – you constantly need to be learning new skills to stay on top,” Carlson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re taking a certification to transition your career or you’re taking a certification to update your skills, that demonstrates to an employer that you’re constantly trying to learn new things. It says you’re open to new challenges and you’re trying to grow yourself as a person and an employee.”</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit any website or blog and you’ll see a combination of text, menus, buttons, and sidebars that help make it easy to navigate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These parts of a website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – e</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">verything you can see and interact with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are examples of what’s called front-end development.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-end development is often called “client-side development” because it refers to everything that the user (the client) can see. Let’s take a closer look at the role of a Front-End Developer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>What Does a Front-End Developer Do?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because front-end development is responsible for what you can see on a website, it’s often confused with web design. Although Front-End Developers don’t design websites, they are the link between design and technology that can turn an idea into an interactive web page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the basic tasks that a Front-End Developer may be responsible for:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with Graphic, User Experience, or Web Designers to help ensure design ideas can be made into a website that is easy to use </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transforming design (sketches or wireframes for a website) into code that a web browser can read and display on your screen </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structuring a website so that it is easy to find through a search engine (this is part of Search Engine Optimization or SEO)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing websites that work and look good on any screen, from 24-inch computer monitors to five-inch smartphone screens (this is called responsive design)</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing websites and fixing bugs or other issues&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Front-End Coding Languages&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing code is the main part of a front-end developer’s job. There are three coding languages commonly used in front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the basic building blocks of every website, and Front-End Developers spend most of their time sourcing, writing, and editing these coding languages. Since every website starts with one or more of these coding languages, Front-End Developers can often use pre-existing code to get started on a project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at these languages and frameworks:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>HTML and CSS</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are what you would call the basic building blocks of programming. Before you can start a career in web development, you will have to master both of these languages. It should be said, though, that these are independent of each other.&nbsp; HTML gives content structure by defining that content into headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, meanwhile, is used to style the appearance of content, with, for example, fonts and colors.</span></p>

<h2><b>JavaScript</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add functionality and complexity to a site. When you see things like real-time content updates, interactive maps, animated graphics, and video elements, JavaScript is usually involved. For this reason, JavaScript can be seen as a third layer (the icing perhaps) of a layer cake of web technology, with HTML and CSS providing the foundations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b></b><b>JavaScript Frameworks</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JS frameworks (including ReactJS, AngularJS, Backbone, and Ember, among others) provide a structure for JavaScript code. Frameworks are often used with libraries like jQuery to minimize initial programming work.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve taken a closer look at what </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-web-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is and how Web Developers are in high demand in cities like </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/vancouvers-tech-market-is-booming-but-its-missing-one-thing-talent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/demand-for-web-developers-grows-in-the-big-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/chicagos-growing-tech-scene-needs-more-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But, if you want to pursue a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=blog_howToBecomeAWebDev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career in development</a>, where do you start? This guide will take you through how to begin a lucrative career in Web Development.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop the Right Background&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get started, it’s recommended that you have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. These fundamentals help you develop the framework and logic for communicating with programming languages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Web Developers start out in IT or software engineering. However, it’s possible to come from a completely different industry such as </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/becoming-a-software-engineer-a-career-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finance and accounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/brainstation-releases-results-from-2019-digital-skills-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that 55 percent of development respondents began their career in a different field and 58 percent have only been programming for five years or less. While experience in your previous career is helpful, a growing number of professionals are taking steps later in their careers to learn development from scratch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Formal Training&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways to train as a Web Developer. Traditionally, professionals start with formal higher education in software engineering, computer science, or related fields. But, it’s also popular to pursue self-directed learning. There are a plethora of online tutorials, YouTube channels, free code camps, free online courses, and more that can be tempting to try when looking for professional development. However, completion rates for these learn-at- your-own-pace courses tend to hover between </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/are-online-courses-worth-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.5 percent and 10 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which may indicate that more experienced learners are using these to pick up specialized skills in a specific area, rather than to build a new career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those skeptical of self-learning, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in-person</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> training is the perfect alternative to accelerate your career in Web Development. In particular, a diploma from an accredited training school can accelerate your career by providing hands-on, intensive programs that prepare you for the workforce. We’ve written about&nbsp;</span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-prepare-for-a-web-development-diploma-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to prepare for a Web Development Diploma Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but here’s what you should look for in a premium training program:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Foundations:&nbsp;</b>Your training program should help you d<span style="font-weight: 400;">evelop a comprehensive understanding of how the web works to better solve complex problems. It will deepen your HTML and CSS knowledge to build and style more advanced static web pages, using frameworks such as Flexbox. You&#8217;ll establish problem-solving practices and logic for understanding advanced programming concepts.</span></p>
<p><b>Programming Fundamentals: </b>Make sure it will i<span style="font-weight: 400;">mprove your programming ability with JavaScript to write and build components. Foundational knowledge of JavaScript and object-oriented programming should be included so you can use a variety of frameworks to enhance your work.</span></p>
<p><b>Front-End Frameworks:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using React, a JavaScript framework, you should learn to build complex and dynamic web pages and professional-level user interfaces.</span></p>
<p><b>Web Servers: </b>Work to b<span style="font-weight: 400;">uild servers using a modern back-end framework and learn how to develop custom APIs and serve static websites and files.</span></p>
<p><b>Server-Side Programming:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your program should provide an understanding of Server Side Rendering and Templating Engines, which are used to create empty page templates populated with dynamic data, such as a series of product pages for an eCommerce store.</span></p>
<p><b>Databases:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand core concepts and learn how to manage databases and data on a web server.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a Portfolio</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve developed a relevant skill-set, so now you’re able to develop a portfolio to show employers! This is your chance to showcase work for a broad variety of clients. Regardless of your specific interests, it’s important to showcase your versatility to ensure clients from various industries get a sense of your abilities. Jay Eckert, Founder and Creative Director of Parachute Design recommends around </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-tips-for-building-a-standout-web-developer-portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 samples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The samples you’ve chosen should be accompanied by explanations of how the project came to life. Share how things were created, envisioned in a way that is clear to a non-developer. That way, potential employers from all backgrounds can get a sense of your process and motivations.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the development world, the seemingly innocuous job title “Full-Stack Developer” can spark some debate.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title seems simple enough: a Full-Stack Developer is someone who handles front- and back-end development. When you dig a bit deeper, though, you realize it’s not that straight forward.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at the specific role of a Full-Stack Developer – and why some still see it as a controversial term.</span></p>



<h2><b>What is Front-End Development?</b></h2>



<p>Front-end development involves the &#8220;client-facing&#8221; side of web development. That is to say that it generally refers to the portion of the site, app, or digital product that users will see and interact with. A Front-End Developer, therefore, is responsible for the way a digital product looks and &#8220;feels,&#8221; which is why they are often also referred to as Web Designers.</p>



<p>Front-End Developers will usually need&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">to possess a solid understanding of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Bootstrap, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS.</span></p>



<h2>Jobs in Front-End Development</h2>



<p>Unlike back-end development, there are a number of job titles that cover different skill sets and experience levels within front-end development, including:</p>



<ul><li>(The obvious) Front-End Developer</li><li>Front-End Engineer</li><li>CSS/HTML Developer</li><li>Front-End Web Designer (this usually denotes a role that involves more visual and interaction design requirements)</li><li>Front-End User Interface Developer (covering interaction design skills)</li><li>Mobile Front-End Developer</li><li>Front-End SEO Expert (usually denoting a Developer with experience incorporating SEO strategy)</li><li>Front-End Accessibility Expert</li><li>Front-End Dev Ops</li><li>Front-End QA (involving unit testing, functional testing, user testing, and A/B testing)</li></ul>



<h2><b>What is Back-End Development?&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p>If Front-End Developers are responsible for how a digital product looks, Back-End Developers are focused on how it works. This means they&#8217;re<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;responsible for overseeing what’s under the hood, including database interactions, user authentication, server, network and hosting configuration, and business logic.</span></p>



<p>The primary responsibility of Back-End Developers is to ensure the functionality of the site, including its responsiveness and speed. To do that,&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-End Developers have to know how&nbsp;to build servers with modern frameworks (while developing custom APIs and serving static websites and files), and how to manage databases and data on a web server. Typically, they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">use server-side languages, including PHP, Ruby, and Python, as well as tools including MySQL, Oracle, and Git.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><b>What is a Full-Stack Developer?</b><b></b></h2>



<p>A Full-Stack Developer is someone&nbsp;familiar with both front- and back-end development. They are generalists, adept at wearing both hats and familiar with every layer of development. Obviously, employers want to hire<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Full-Stack Developers – according to an Indeed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the title is contentious, it&#8217;s in the generalist nature of the position.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers who specialize in the front-end or back-end often bristle at the notion that someone could be equally adept at both – the expression “jack-of-all-trades, master of none” comes to mind.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My defensive tendencies are normally put on high alert when I hear that magic phrase (‘full-stack’),” </span><a href="http://andyshora.com/full-stack-developers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Front-End Developer Andy Shora. “Stacks are a lot bigger than what they used to be, and being able to claim one has acquired refined skills at every layer of web development is certainly not a small claim.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean you have a broad range of skills or you specialize in everything?”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that perception persists, there still is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;an increasing number of tech professionals who consider themselves Full-Stack Developers. According to Stack Overflow’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 survey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Developers, 48.2 percent consider themselves Full-Stack Developers – up from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">28 percent in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>



<p>What&#8217;s unclear is whether&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers are now expected to possess a broader skillset, or if&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers are taking it upon themselves to understand functions at both the front and back end. Either way, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly important for aspiring Developers to have a foundation in both.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For most people hoping to break into web improvement, you should center around working up an establishment in both front-end and back-end advancement first,” </span><a href="https://medium.com/@ansertechgeek/front-end-vs-back-end-which-and-why-31c2a6b96b2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Software Engineer and Tech Writer Muhammad Anser. “At that point, you can float towards a claim to fame later on.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with demand for Developers&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected to grow 15 percent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026 (for 24,400 new jobs), much faster than the U.S. average rate of job growth, there may not be a better time to dive in and learn more about all the layers of Web Development.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written in the past about the growth of Vancouver’s tech sector and how that was </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/vancouvers-tech-market-is-booming-but-its-missing-one-thing-talent"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing the demand for Web Developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you need a summary, here it is: Vancouver is definitely full of companies looking to add to their development teams.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve rounded up some of Vancouver’s most exciting, and fastest-growing companies that are on the hunt for skilled Developers. Could that be you? Check out our list below.</span></p>



<h2>Allocadia</h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by identical twin sisters, Kristen and Katherine, Allocadia is a Marketing Performance Management Software that helps businesses seamlessly manage their marketing spends, campaigns, and results in one platform. Today the company manages over $25B in marketing spend, putting up an impressive 175% growth year-over-year in new customer revenue earlier this month.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allocadia is looking to add a </span><a href="https://allocadia.applytojob.com/apply/OuDSyZVehb/Software-Developer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the team to clients with real solutions that think outside the box and embrace new technology. </span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>



<h2>Clio</h2>



<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t heard of Clio yet, they’re shaking up the legal world in the best way possible. Clio is a cloud-based legal practice management platform that’s making lawyer’s lives simpler by helping them organize and manage their practice. Amongst many accolades, Clio has been recognized as CIX’s Top 20 Most Influential Technology Companies and for the last two years, has made it onto Deloitte&#8217;s Fast 50 list.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clio is looking for a </span><a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/goclio/jobs/1740124"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to join the award-winning Business Operations team to build customized Salesforce solutions for the business.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><b>Fresh Prep</b></h2>



<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the story goes, meal kit delivery service Fresh Prep was founded in 2015 by three friends that knew dinner didn’t have to be stressful.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Fresh Prep has delivered more than 1 million meals. They’ve also experienced some incredible growth, completing their first round of funding in December 2018, expanding into new regions, and moving into a 35,000 square foot facility in East Vancouver, which serves as headquarters for operations and kit production.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh Prep is looking to hire a </span><a href="https://secure.collage.co/jobs/freshprep/13083"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Stack Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://secure.collage.co/jobs/freshprep/13085"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior Full Stack Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help bring their customer experience to new levels.</span></p>



<h2><b>tentree</b><b><br></b><b></b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to hone in on your dev skills while working for a company that gives back to our planet? tentree is a Vancouver-based clothing brand that creates women’s and men’s apparel from sustainable materials.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their commitment to sustainability, however, does not stop there. For every single item purchased from tentree, the company (alongside its partners) plants ten trees.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">tentree is looking to hire a </span><a href="https://tentree.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=79"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jr. Web Developer </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to support their Shopify Plus sites and other ongoing development projects.</span></p>



<h2><b>Unbounce</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What business doesn’t need a beautiful landing page to boost conversions? With marketing teams sick of waiting on Developers to build new pages for campaigns, Unbounce took matters into their own hands and created a better experience for Marketers in 2009 with a platform that allows you to build landing pages without, ironically for this post, learning how to code.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbounce has made Deloitte’s Fast 50 list in 2016, 2017 and 2018 – perhaps we’ll see them on this year’s list as well. They’re looking to hire a </span><a href="https://careers.unbounce.com/backend-developer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backend Developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “power future innovations at Unbounce.”</span></p>
