								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the breakneck pace of change in the marketing field, it can be difficult for experienced Marketers to stay on top of the latest strategies and methodologies – let alone outsiders or newbies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, we wanted to define and differentiate two key phrases: growth marketing vs. brand marketing.</span></p>

<h3><b>What is Brand Marketing?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As interest in both marketing strategies has been on a steep upswing in recent years, it’s worth taking a look at both brand and growth marketing on their own merits before exploring the differences and relative advantages of both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand marketing is focused on, yes, boosting and establishing a company’s brand. The process would start by identifying your brand and asking yourself questions such as these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is our target audience? What do they need?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is our company different from the competition?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is our brand’s personality?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is our brand statement?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate goal of brand marketing is to boost awareness, visibility, and recognition of your brand while creating clearly defined – and positive! – emotional associations between your brand and your consumers. Consider how we associate Apple with innovation, ease of use and clean design, or how Nike will always be linked to sweat, hard work and determination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, brand marketing is less about pushing a specific product or promotion and more about telling your story in a way that resonates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing a brand as rock-solid as those mentioned won’t happen unless marketers stick to several principles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consistency. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To really hammer home the story of your brand, your marketing efforts need to be consistent – in terms of messaging, voice and visual aesthetics – across all platforms</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Emotion. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aren’t just loyal to certain companies or brands because we like their products – often, our buying decisions are tied to our sense of identity and the perceived values of the companies making those products. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Delivery. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust is an essential element in building a powerful brand, so be sure that your marketing aligns with what you’re actually giving your customers. For example, consider Volkswagen, who built up decades of brand equity as a manufacturer of reliable and practical cars before an emissions-cheating scandal badly hurt the company’s reputation in 2015.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With brand marketing, measurable objectives could include friendly media coverage, attention or endorsements from influencers, or heightened social-media engagement.</span></p>
<h3><b>What is Growth Marketing?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional marketing is typically focused on the top of the funnel, where a set of so-called “set it and forget it” strategies are employed – say, a digital and print ad campaign with a set budget and carefully planned-out copy – with two primary goals: awareness and acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth marketing, conversely, is concerned with the entire funnel, where the goal is revenue growth not merely through bringing in new customers but also through the activation, retention, referral, and monetization of the customers you already have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth marketing is removing the boundaries of marketing to enable every aspect of the customer experience to focus on attracting more engaged customers,” </span><a href="https://www.drift.com/blog/what-is-growth-marketing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mike Volpe, CEO of Lola.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where traditionally, marketing departments might have been their own separate entity within a corporate structure, growth marketers are often more integrated within product development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following agile development principles, growth marketing is a data-driven process that operates on a cyclical sprint model where performance is constantly tracked, tweaked and optimized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Largely borne out of need – since startups rarely have massive marketing budgets – growth marketing is an evidence-based process that leans heavily on strategy. It’s experimental, iterative and – most importantly of all – user-focused, since growth marketing is far more concerned with customer lifetime value and customer retention than simple customer acquisition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B testing, analytics, engagement measurement, and user-testing are all crucial parts of the growth marketing process, as well as creating measurable goals and staying current and agile with campaigns-in-progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good growth marketers are often very creative. Perhaps most famously, when Airbnb was just getting off the ground, the startup cleverly tapped into a much larger user base than its own by offering users who listed their properties on Airbnb the option to post them to Craigslist as well (it wasn’t as simple as it sounds, as a bot had to be built to create the Craigslist posting before forwarding to the user for publishing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples include Pinterest creating an air of exclusivity by requiring members to request an invitation to join, or Dropbox turning its users into mobile marketers by incentivizing referrals with free storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feature of growth marketing? Expect a more reactive planning cycle, where new tactics and strategies are expedited and executed regularly.</span></p>

<h3><b>Finding the Right Balance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the modern marketer has to understand how to employ both growth marketing and brand marketing techniques in tandem to bring the best possible return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, growth marketing to some degree depends on brand marketing. As opposed to growth hacking, which is purely driven by tactical performance marketing, a goal of growth marketing is to create brand awareness and affinity among customers who should perhaps buy your product even if they aren’t ready to do so yet. In other words, the results of your marketing efforts must be sustainable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leads us to something both brand and growth marketing strategies have in common, and one reason it makes sense to use both strategies together: their success is measured in the long term. And to that end, successful growth and brand marketing strategies both require and reward commitment.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into full force in May 2018, it was hot on the heels of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The data breach heard around the world made consumers suddenly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aware of how their personal data could be collected and manipulated without their consent. It’s a pressing conversation that continues to evolve alongside rapid advances in technology to this day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the internet became increasingly data-driven over the years, the European Union (EU) recognized that the privacy standards they’d had in place since 1995, the European Data Protection Directive, needed updating. In April 2016, the European Parliament adopted the GDPR and asked that all businesses be compliant by 2018. The GDPR embodies the EU’s firm stance on data protection and privacy and applies uniformly to all EU member states (unlike the former directive).&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Does GDPR Apply to You?&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, it’s important to note that the GDPR has implications outside of the EU. If you’re wondering if this applies to you, ask yourself these 2 simple questions:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you offer goods or services in the EU?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you collecting or processing the personal data of EU citizens or residents for commercial purposes?</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you answered yes to either or both of these questions, then you need to comply with GDPR. This actually means that the majority of companies with global reach need to have a data strategy in place to avoid penalties of up to tens of millions of euros.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide how and why personal data is being used, you’re likely what the GDPR calls the “Data Controller.” This can be a business owner or simply a member of the data team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, if you’re someone who processes data on behalf of a third party, you’re called a “Data Processor.” The GDPR has special regulations for processors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s Considered Personal Data?&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a law that’s all about protecting personal data, it’s crucial to understand what kinds of data are included in the equation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en#answer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, personal data is any piece of information that can identify a living individual. This includes, but isn’t limited to, information such as names and surnames, personal email addresses, home addresses, biometric data and location data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information that’s completely anonymous (and can’t be reversed in any way) is not considered personal data. This includes email addresses that are generic (support@company.com) or a company registration number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GDPR is technology agnostic, which means personal data must be protected regardless of how it’s being collected, organized, structured, used or deleted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>7 Principles for Data Protection</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to data protection and many parts of the law leave room for interpretation. The GDPR does lay out some guiding principles for processing personal data.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Process the data you collect lawfully, fairly, and transparently.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect data for a specific and explicit purpose and only process that data as it relates to that purpose. The only exception is if the data is being used for research, statistical, or scientific purposes for the good of the public.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimize the amount of personal data you collect. Don’t collect more than is needed for the intended purpose.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep the data you collect up-to-date. If you’re unable to do this, then you must make a reasonable effort to update or delete it quickly.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal data can be kept in a form that allows you to identify individuals only for as long as it takes to fulfill your intended purpose. Again, there are exceptions for research, statistical, or scientific purposes.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have measures in place to process data in a way that safeguards it from unauthorized processing or altering, loss, or damage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data controller is ultimately held accountable and must be able to prove compliance.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>When is it Okay to Process Personal Data?&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain conditions must be met for your data processing to be considered “lawful”. Like other regulations of its kind, consent plays a leading role.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few situations where you’d be able to process personal data without consent, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to fulfill a contract such as a background check for employment,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a court order, and&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to save a life.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list is not extensive, but you can read the full list in Chapter 2, Article 6 of the GDPR.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Getting Consent to Process Data</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you need to know about getting consent is that you need to prove that it happened. Consent can be given electronically, orally, or in writing as long as it’s an affirmative action (like ticking a box to opt-in).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re getting consent for more than one action, you need to make each action clear to the individual using clear and plain language. You need to make it as easy and nondisruptive as possible for an individual to revoke consent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because consent needs to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">freely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> given, you can’t make the execution of a contract (for example, a sale) dependant on providing consent when that personal data isn’t actually needed to fulfill that contract.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>How the GDPR Can Impact Your Data Processes</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The individual, or what the GDPR calls the “data subject,” has certain rights regarding their personal data. Understanding each of them will help ensure that you have reasonable processes in place to respect them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rights include:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The right to access data.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If requested, you must be able to tell the data subject what personal data is being collected, the purpose of collecting it, who will be processing it, and how long you intend to store it. The data subject can also request a copy of their data free of charge which you must be able to provide in common electronic form.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The right to correct and updated data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You need to be able to quickly update inaccurate or incomplete data if requested by the data subject.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The right to have data erased.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The GDPR calls this “the right to be forgotten”. The data subject can ask that you erase their data, although there are some limitations to this, including a court order.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The right to restrict processing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the data subject thinks your data is inaccurate, being processed unlawfully, or is no longer required for your intended purpose they can restrict you from processing it.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The right to share their data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The data subject can request their data, which you need to provide in a machine-readable format, so they can transmit that data to another controller.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><b>The right to object. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you can come up with a legitimate reason why you need to process someone’s personal data, the data subject has the right to object to you processing it. This is especially applicable when it comes to data being used for marketing purposes.</span></b></b>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The right not to be subject to an automated decision. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The data subject can refuse to have a significant decision, like a job or credit application, made about their profile automatically without any human intervention.</span></b></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When data or information about data is requested, you need to have internal processes in place that enable you to action them within one month of receipt. It needs to be provided in a concise and easy to understand way and can be done in writing, electronically, or orally (if identity can be verified).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the unfortunate event that you experience a data breach, you’re obligated to inform data subjects within 72 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>What You Can do to Comply&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the GDPR, you must be able to demonstrate compliance before you’re asked.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDPR.eu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests the following to get started:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assign responsibility to someone on your team&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document all the details of your data processing practice including why data is processed and how</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure all your staff are properly trained</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have responsible and compliant contracts with third-party data processors keeping in mind that you’re ultimately accountable&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider appointing a </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-protection-officer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Protection Officer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (in some cases, you might actually be obligated to have one)&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring the GDPR comes at a hefty cost. Fines can be up to €20 million or 4% of your global revenue if higher, not to mention the loss of trust and credibility that comes with a data breach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stakes this high, it’s worth sweating the small stuff. Read the </span><a href="https://gdpr.eu/tag/gdpr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire document on GDPR.eu. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, those in the industry are seeing a larger and larger focus on machine learning. BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that machine learning was the trend most likely to have an impact on the work of data professionals, with 80 percent of data respondents singling it out as the top difference-maker in the coming five-to-10 years. And Google Trends shows that its popularity as a search term has grown roughly 200 percent over the last three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, what’s the difference between data science and machine learning? We took a closer look.</span></p>
<h2><b>Machine Learning</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply, machine learning – or the process of a computer learning how to better perform a task as it gains more experience doing so – uses&nbsp;algorithms to make predictions and find patterns. Machine learning spans a wide array of ideas, tools, and techniques used by Data Scientists and other professionals, and it’s one of the most popular methods for processing big amounts of raw data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be easiest to view machine learning as a part of data science. Machine learning frees Data Scientists from the tedious task of sifting through massive volumes of data by using complex algorithms and problem-solving methods including supervised and unsupervised learning, regression, classification, clustering, and neural networks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of machine learning are all around you. Facebook, for instance, uses machine learning to analyze your past behavior to present content and notifications in line with your interests. Similarly, when Netflix somehow recommends a show you’d love to binge-watch, it’s an example of machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the simplest example of machine learning in motion lies in how it approaches the task of recognizing handwriting. To train a machine with examples of correct input-output pairs – which is called supervised machine learning – the computer is shown images of handwritten numbers alongside the correct labels for those digits. The computer then tries to figure out the shared characteristics of each digit, and gradually picks up on the patterns between the images and the labels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, machine learning is effective to solve problems that are statistical or probabilistic in nature, deeply complex, and that can be adequately handled with an approximate solution. For instance, the issue of detecting credit card fraud checks those boxes: solutions are probabilistic because a determination won’t be made until a company reaches its customer; the rules around fraud are complex; and approximate solutions are adequate since we’re simply flagging transactions for further review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although many of the more advanced machine learning tools do require some experience and knowhow, the basics can still be impactful for those looking to dig deeper. Many supervised and unsupervised learning models are implemented in R and Python, and straightforward models like linear or logistic regression can be used to perform informative machine-learning tasks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Data Science</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data science uses technology and math to find otherwise invisible patterns in raw data to help us make predictions and better-informed decisions. As more and more data is generated and collected by companies, data science is the key to finding otherwise hidden insights that can have a transformative effect on factors including consumer behavior, operational issues, marketing opportunities, supply-chain cycles, and predictive analyses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Data Scientist spends significant time collecting, extracting, cleaning, modeling and analyzing data before using an array of techniques to come to meaningful conclusions, including predictive causal analytics (or predicting the possibilities of an event in the future), prescriptive analytics (conjuring a range of actions and the related outcomes) and, yes, machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might sound as though Data Scientists spend their days buried in numbers, but that isn’t the case. BrainStation’s Digital Skills Survey found that Data Scientists primarily work on developing new ideas, products, and services, as opposed to optimizing existing platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while a majority of respondents (73 percent) indicated that they work with numerical data, 61 percent said they also work with text, 44 percent with structured data, 13 percent with images, and 12 percent with graphics. Some even work with video and audio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all cases, however, the goal of data science is to leverage data to help a company make better decisions. And given the sheer volume of data being generated and now analyzed, data science is a field that has never been more important.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business sends emails in Canada, you’re going to want to get comfortable with the ins and outs of CASL. Despite the name, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) doesn’t only apply to spammers. In fact, it’s often described as the most comprehensive law of its kind in the world, and it seems to be making an impact.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the first of April and the end of September in 2018, the Spam Reporting Center received 5,000 emails a week detailing complaints from Canadian consumers. Since the legislation was introduced, there has been a 37 percent decrease in Canada-based spam email.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Overview of CASL</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CASL is a federal law that was introduced in 2014 in response to a rise in instances of phishing, identity theft and the spread of malicious software. It establishes the rules around commercial electronic messages (CEM) and is meant to protect the inboxes of Canadians and to make Canadian businesses more competitive in the global digital market.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the law covers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending unsolicited emails, text messages, and social media communications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installing software without consent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using misleading information to sell products or promote services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessing computers or electronic devices without consent in an effort to collect personal information&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting and using emails without consent (harvesting)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/campaign-creators-VV0En9viu2M-unsplash.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10182 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/campaign-creators-VV0En9viu2M-unsplash-1024x707.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="707" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/campaign-creators-VV0En9viu2M-unsplash-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/campaign-creators-VV0En9viu2M-unsplash-300x207.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/campaign-creators-VV0En9viu2M-unsplash-768x531.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/campaign-creators-VV0En9viu2M-unsplash-960x663.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>The positive impact of CASL</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Government of Canada’s website, businesses have actually benefited in some ways from the introduction of the law.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the law has forced businesses to be more deliberate with their CEMs. As a result, click-through-rates have actually increased and bounce rates have decreased.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proportion of emails reaching the intended recipient rose from 79 percent to 90 percent (compared to 80 percent worldwide). Interestingly, the number of emails opened and read have also increased, <a href="https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rising from 26 percent to 32 percent</a>.</span></p>
<h2><b>Getting consent</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consent plays a huge role in CASL compliance. Businesses sending emails or text messages to potential or existing customers need to first obtain their consent. In the case of a complaint, your business needs to be able to provide evidence of this consent. This means keeping copies of electronic forms, screenshots, audio recordings, and documents that outline your CASL procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of consent: express consent and implied consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Express consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is when the receiver has voluntarily opted-in to receiving communications from your business. This can be done verbally, electronically or in writing. There’s no time limit on this unless the receiver revokes their consent. When you’re looking to get someone’s express consent, you must do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain clearly why you’re looking for consent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make obvious who is asking for consent, whether it’s you or if you’re acting on behalf of a third party</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide the address of the party looking for consent, including web and mailing address and phone number</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let the receiver know that they can revoke consent at any time</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An important detail to note about providing express consent is that the individual must be asked to complete an action that proves their intent. For example, you can ask them to type in their email address or check a box. You can’t, on the other hand, have the box already checked and expect the individual to uncheck it themselves to opt-out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Implied consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can only exist if the receiver has an existing relationship with your business. This relationship can be business or non-business related.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of a business relationship with implied consent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone buys one of your products or services&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone has sent you an inquiry in the last 6 months&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve entered into a written contract with someone</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of a non-business relationship with implied consent:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone has visibly published their email online and hasn’t clearly stated that they don’t want to receive emails</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone has given you their business card which includes their email&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone has made a donation to your charity (for non-profits)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that implied consent is valid for 2 years, a timeframe that renews with each transaction (ie. buying a product).</span></p>
<h2><b>Complying with CASL</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some questions you might want to ask yourself the next time you send out a CEM.</span></p>
<h3><b>Have they agreed to hear from you?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have express consent, be sure to keep a record of it. If you have implied consent, double-check that you’re within the two-year time period.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Does your email include the appropriate contact information?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your email needs to include the contact information of the sender, whether that’s your business or a third party’s. Contact information includes mailing address, name, phone number, email and website address. This information needs to be valid for at least 60 days </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the communication was sent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Are the contents of your communication truthful?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your CEM should not contain any misleading or false information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Have you given the receiver the opportunity to opt-out of hearing from you?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be made clear to the receiver how they can unsubscribe from future communication. Your unsubscribe mechanism should be functioning at all times, even if that means it can be done simply by replying to your email. There should also be no cost (financial or otherwise) to the individual. Once you’re alerted to an opt-out request, you have 10 working days to comply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>The consequence of not complying</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the responsibility for CASL compliance rests primarily with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), there are actually three governing bodies working together on enforcement: the CRTC, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and the Competition Bureau.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For serious violations, businesses can be fined up to $10 million, while individuals can be fined up to $1 million. In 2015, Rogers Media was fined $200,000 for failing to provide receivers with a functioning unsubscribe mechanism. Porter Airlines was fined $150,000 for sending emails to people who had previously unsubscribed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Don’t be an uninvited guest</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of the financial penalty, it’s not worth rubbing existing or potential customers the wrong way by dropping into their inboxes without an invitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if post-CASL click-through and bounce rates have shown us anything, it’s that the legislation is in lockstep with changing customer expectations around digital etiquette.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test your CASL knowledge by taking their </span><a href="https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/00016.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">short quiz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To learn more about CASL compliance, </span><a href="https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/home"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visit the Government of Canada’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With every advancement in artificial intelligence, more people begin to worry: are robots coming for my job? And certainly, Web Developers are among those most concerned about being replaced by AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/development"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 78 percent of Developers believe that AI and machine learning are the trends that would have the most impact on development over the next five to 10 years. Meanwhile, when Evans Data Corp </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">polled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 550 Developers on the most worrying aspects of their career, 29 percent – the most common response – were anxious about being replaced by AI</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps that concern stems from the rise in popularity of AI-integrated website-building tools like Squarespace, Adobe Sensei, Bookmark, Firedrop, and Wix’s ADI, or from pessimistic studies like one from Oxford that forecast a 21 percent probability that the work of Web Developers could someday be automated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are few who doubt that AI will change the work of Web Developers. But instead of seeing AI as a threat to replace Developers, many experts in the field, in fact, see artificial intelligence as a powerful tool that is making a Developer’s day-to-day work life easier and more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see AI as a tool that will augment and enrich a Web Developer’s arsenal, rather than stealing their job,” said BrainStation Instructor Dan O’Donnell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Broadly speaking, AI is great at replacing humans in tasks that allow ‘fuzzy’ outcomes where there is either no right answer, or it’s OK to get the wrong answer some of the time. On the other hand, where it is business-critical that things work as predictably as possible, discrete instructions written by human beings will continue to be the way to go.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Can AI Work on Design?&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital design is widely viewed as too crucial a factor to leave up to AI Even beyond the myriad brand ramifications of bad design, a recent Vistaprint survey found that 42 percent of customers would be not very likely and 21 percent would be not likely at all to make a purchase from a website that they found to be poorly designed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And some early forays into AI-designed websites didn’t inspire confidence. The CMS the Grid launched with significant hype, millions in VC funding and major promises, but when the design community began unearthing real-world examples of websites built with the platform, their reaction was </span><a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/65265-the-first-gridio-sites-have-surfaced-and-theyre-kinda-terrible"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mixed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and now, some in the community wonder if the site-builder </span><a href="https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/what-happened-to-the-grid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still exists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as other website builders like Wix and Squarespace have risen in popularity and sophistication, those tools and other trained models can’t quite replicate the work of a talented front-end developer.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trained AI models can certainly learn to produce beautiful and functional web layouts and even auto-generate robust code behind them. For a quick-and-easy website, this may be sufficient,” O’Donnell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if a designer wishes to make some very specific changes, or if something doesn&#8217;t look quite right on a particular screen, a human Developer will likely have to step in and re-code some or all of that layout manually. A similar argument can be made as to why front-end focused Developers have not been replaced by the likes of Wix or Squarespace.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Back-End Development Needs a Human Touch</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the server-side, too, a human touch is needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Back-end web development involves writing robust, bug-free code that performs discrete business-critical tasks like updating a user&#8217;s database record or processing a credit card transaction. These tasks need to be prescribed, reliable and repeatable; for these reasons, it is unlikely we&#8217;ll see many tech companies replacing their Web Developers and the code they write with AI models any time soon,” O’Donnell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that isn’t to say that AI doesn’t have a prominent place in the future of web development and design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Silka Miesnieks, Adobe’s Head of Emerging Design, </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2018/03/07/design-artificial-intelligence-ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “In most cases, AI only affects a percentage of a job a person does, but rarely the whole job. And if you free up workers to do more of the creative and other work they are good at, while leaving other tasks for AI, you can grow your organization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, AI has the power to handle some of the banal, time-consuming tasks that waste Developers’ time on a daily basis. AI can save time by updating database records, performing simple image editing jobs, automatically adding numbers, and creating predictive coding to solve glitches, to name merely a few examples. According to a recent Capgemini’s 2018-19 World Quality Report, 57 percent of respondents also reported using AI for quality assurance and testing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other AI-driven innovations that are making the lives of web developers easier include Sketch2Code, which transforms hand-drawn designs into HTML, while Adobe Sensei uses AI and machine learning to help you unearth opportunities, offer personalized experiences, and speed up a number of time-consuming processes, including the ability to automatically add image descriptors, to score image quality on professional dimensions, and to automatically crop and mask images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And website builders can be a good tool even if a human touch is ultimately required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reliability and predictability are big parts of web development, but there are also a number of more subjective areas where AI can make a significant impact. As an example, a lot of great AI work is being done at the interface of web development and web design,” O’Donnell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if a human Developer is required to fine-tune things, AI can certainly help minimize time and effort by taking care of the broad strokes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even on the server-side, AI can certainly play a role,” he added. “Back-end development still has a number of more subjective operational tasks most humans would happily give away to a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tasks, O’Donnell explains, include inspecting error logs, analyzing performance data, or even identifying what coding styles are likely to produce the most bugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AI-driven advances in these areas will help web developers focus more on the task they enjoy doing most – writing code,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX design and UI design sound similar — and there’s definitely some overlap — but these are also two distinct fields that really boost a team’s ability to create products that look good and work well for end-users.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UX design is a little more analytical and UI is a little more visual and more closely related to something like graphic design,” says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Designer and Web Developer Jesse Showalter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Though the two are similar in some ways, they are also very, very different.”</span>
</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often people in these roles are working in tandem on the same team — or, at times, it’s one person wearing both hats.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But they do use different tools, different skills, and approach the problem in a different way,” Showalter explains.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting into the nitty-gritty of the two roles, let’s start with the basics.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><b>What is UX Design?&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX is referring to user experience design. It’s the process of boosting someone’s satisfaction while they’re using a particular product — be it a website or an app — by researching, analyzing, testing, and ultimately refining the design and features.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, they might study the checkout process of an e-commerce website to see whether users find the process of buying products from the website easy and pleasant,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains Jacob Gube</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Smashing Magazine.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designers working in this space are looking at the bigger picture of how all the moving pieces in a product work together and how users interact with it. In short, it’s not just about how a product looks, but how someone feels while using it.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_UXDesignvsUIDesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Design courses</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></p>



<h2><b>What is UI Design?&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI stands for user interface design, and it’s a field with a narrower focus than UX. It’s also closer to traditional graphic design, though the day-to-day challenges can be more complex.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike UX designers who are concerned with the overall feel of the product, user interface designers are particular about how the product is laid out,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains Lo Min Ming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fast Company.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, they’re in charge of designing each screen or page that users interact with — and making sure it all works together and creates the experience a UX designer is aiming for.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example, a UI designer creating an analytics dashboard might front-load the most important content at the top, or decide whether a slider or a control knob makes the most intuitive sense to adjust a graph,” Ming continues.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other aspects of the role could include creating a cohesive style guide, maintaining visual consistency, and working alongside graphic designers and copywriters who are creating content for the product.</span></p>



<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-interface-design#utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_UXDesignvsUIDesign" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI Design courses</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></p>



<h2><b>UX Design Versus UI Design&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every company, there’s no question these roles are often working closely together while serving distinct purposes.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showalter puts it this way: UI without UX is like a painter “throwing paint randomly at a canvas,” hoping it looks good. UX is like a “sculpture without a frame,” with </span></p>





<p>
nothing to give the piece purpose.&nbsp;
</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, it’s not enough to approach a project with just a UI point-of-view — like picking out colors and layouts for different website pages without any research or testing to show how users actually move through the site, and how they feel about its usability.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, UX designers need UI designers to actually make their vision and research come to life through a tangible, beautiful product that people can actually use.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the roles are so interconnected, you really can’t have one without the other.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The boundary between UI and UX designers is fairly blurred and it is not uncommon for companies to opt to combine these roles,” Ming notes. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All UX Designers are problem-solvers. It’s a role that puts a research-backed, creative spin on figuring out how to make life a little better and easier for customers using a company’s digital offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that goal in mind comes the need for a framework to actually make it happen. Enter UX design thinking (and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_whatisDesignThinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design thinking courses</a> at BrainStation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far back as the 1960s, various types of Designers — the more traditional kind working in advertising and marketing — started looking for a more scientific approach to their craft. The notion of “design thinking,” as a universal workflow for Designers to follow, started gaining traction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, UX Designers have zeroed in on a process of their own — an approach to conceptualizing and building products that solve problems while creating positive experiences for end-users.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/september-october-2015/design-thinking-and-ux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Futurist Dirk Knemeyer puts it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, design thinking “caught fire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Progressive and heady Designers joined together with the new breed of liberal arts problem solvers, particularly ethnographers and anthropologists, to help design thinking spread like wildfire,” he writes in Interactions magazine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whereas UX developed systematically in the bubble of Silicon Valley, design thinking rode the trend of innovation and Web 2.0 to make its way into boardroom conversations straightaway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how exactly does design thinking work?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the UX side of design, you can create a tool that helps people live their lives to the fullest, with as little stress as possible,” writes </span><a href="https://www.justinmind.com/blog/design-thinking-process-ux-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebeca Costa for Justinmind’s blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The design thinking methodology is a means to that end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process involves five phases — empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test — which Designers move through, though often not in that exact order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, it’s “a non-linear, iterative process which seeks to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test,” explains the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction Design Foundation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costa says it’s all about understanding people and problems. And while you might move from one phase to another, it’s okay — and often a good thing — to go back and revisit earlier phases in the process to test new and better ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This back and forth is good because it encourages constant reiteration, which tends to help Designers spot issues and potential downfalls of their product while still in the development phase,” she adds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here’s what it looks like to go through the phases:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 1: Empathize</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This phase is all about researching your end-users’ needs through an empathetic lens. You want to put yourself in a client or customer’s shoes — looking at the problem at hand through their worldview, not your own.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who are the future users of a digital product you are creating, what makes the target audience distinctive, what are their habits, what is their online behavior like, where are the pain-points, what are the users’ needs that have to be fulfilled? Answering these questions may help you make a good start,” recommends </span><a href="https://www.popwebdesign.net/popart_blog/en/author/nadja_b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nađa Božović</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Community Manager for PopArt Studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done right, this phase helps set the foundation for a product offering that hits the mark when it comes to what users are looking for.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 2: Define</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve dug into what your target users need, it’s time to compile and analyze those observations to figure out the real problem you’re trying to solve.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Božović notes, this is the time to start thinking about the steps users need to make to successfully use your digital product, whether it’s a website, app, or online store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That could include mapping your users’ journey and defining all the problems they may stumble upon along the way of interacting with your site,” she adds.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 3: Ideate</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With lots of insight into user needs analyzed and ready to go, it’s a good time to start brainstorming concepts and challenging your own assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this point, you’ve done your research and have a clear understanding of who the product is for, what it’s meant to do for its users and why that matters to the users,” writes Costa. “Now, you and your team can start dreaming up ways that your design could check all the right boxes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don’t be afraid to think outside the box: The sky’s the limit in this phase, so don’t shy away from innovating, atypical ideas. Get those creative juices flowing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 4: Prototype</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the phase where you want to zero in on some solutions that could actually be feasible and produce the best result — then get building them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means sketching out ideas for, say, your app offering, and building digital wireframe prototypes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Prototyping is crucial because they make sure that there are no doubts over the main characteristics of the design,” Costa writes.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase 5: Test</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t exactly the final phase since you’ll likely wind up jumping back and forth to earlier steps in the process — but it’s certainly a crucial, unavoidable one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This stage is all about thoroughly testing your product in order to refine the design and ensure it really meets user needs and creates an ideal experience. You’re assessing the basics — does the website or app work properly, or does it have any bugs or glitches — and the deeper experiential aspect of how people feel while using it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are fortunate (and skillful) enough, you might create a flawless design out of the first try,” writes Božović. “More likely, though, there will be some errors to fix. And that is completely fine, as one of the core principles of design thinking process might also be – to tolerate failure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, you’ll likely have to pick yourself up, dust your design off, and start the process all over again until you develop a product that hits the mark.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve recently </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the skyrocketing demand for Data Scientists and the reasons the field is growing at such a rapid rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re interested in the technical skills required by the field, read on for the top programming languages for Data Science.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Python</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a manageable learning curve and an array of libraries that allow for near-endless applications, Python is the top programming language of choice for many Data Scientists who appreciate its accessibility, ease of use and general-purpose versatility. In fact, BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/data"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that Python was the most frequently used tool for Data Scientists overall.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since being introduced in 1991, Python has built up a growing number of dedicated libraries to carry out tasks including data preprocessing, analysis, predictions, visualization, and preservation. Meanwhile, Python libraries including Tensorflow, pandas, and scikit-learn allow for more advanced machine learning or deep learning applications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Scientists also tend to find Python to be generally faster than R and better for data manipulation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You can find out more about this language with BrainStation&#8217;s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/python-programming?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_ProgrammingLanguagesforDataScience">Python Programming Course</a>.</p>
<h2><b>R</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A free, open-source programming language that was released in 1995 as a descendant of the S programming language, R offers a top-notch range of quality domain-specific packages to meet nearly every statistical and data visualization application a Data Scientist might need, including neural networks, non-linear regression, advanced plotting and much more. Its visualization library ggplot2 is a powerful tool, and R’s static graphics can make it easier to produce graphs and mathematical symbols and formulae.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Python does have a speed advantage over the slower R, but for specific statistical and data analysis purposes, R’s vast range of packages gives it a slight edge between the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth noting that R isn’t a general-purpose programming language and is intended to be used specifically for statistical analysis. And R does feature a steeper learning curve than the approachable Python.</span></p>
<h2><b>SQL</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing for “Structured Query Language,” SQL has been at the core of storing and retrieving data for decades now. SQL is a domain-specific language for managing data in relational databases and it’s a must-have skill for Data Scientists, who rely on SQL for updating, querying, editing and manipulating databases and extracting data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL is particularly helpful for managing structured data, especially within large databases. And since SQL is a core skill, it’s helpful that its declarative language is quite readable and intuitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though SQL is not as useful as an analytical tool, it is a highly efficient and crucial tool for data retrieval.</span></p>

</div>
<h2><b>Java</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the oldest general-purpose languages used by Data Scientists, Java’s strength lies in part in its popularity and ubiquity: many companies, especially big, international companies, used Java to create backend systems and applications for desktop, mobile or web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java skills are increasingly attractive in part because of the possibility of weaving data science production code directly into an existing database. It’s also highly regarded for its performance, type safety and portability between platforms. And it’s worth noting that Hadoop runs on the Java virtual machine (JVM), another reason Java is a must-have skill for Data Scientists.</span></p>
<h2><b>Scala</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User-friendly and flexible, Scala is the ideal programming language when dealing with great volumes of data. Combining object-oriented and functional programming, Scala avoids bugs in complex applications with its static types, facilitates large-scale parallel processing, and, when paired with Apache Spark, provides high-performance cluster computing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineered to run on the JVM, anything written on Scala can run anywhere that Java runs. It is becoming especially popular for anyone building complex algorithms or performing large-scale machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scala does feature a steeper learning curve than some programming languages, but its massive user base is a testament to the value in sticking with it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Julia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A much newer programming language than others on this list, Julia has nevertheless made a fast impression thanks to its lightning-fast performance, simplicity, and readability. Designed for numerical analysis and computational science, Julia is especially useful for solving complex mathematical operations, which explains why it’s becoming a fixture in the financial industry. It’s also becoming widely known as a language for artificial intelligence, and many large banks are now using Julia for risk analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the language is relatively young, Julia does lack the variety of packages offered by R or Python.</span></p>
<h2><b>MATLAB</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used widely in statistical analysis, this proprietary numerical computing language will be helpful for Data Scientists dealing with high-level mathematical needs, including Fourier transforms, signal processing, image processing, and matrix algebra. MATLAB has become widely used in industry and academia for its intensive mathematical functionality. It’s also worth mentioning its value as a data visualization tool, as it features some great inbuilt plotting capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATLAB can also help cut down on time spent preprocessing data and help you find the best machine-learning models, regardless of your level of expertise.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying that email is a major communication channel for businesses and a dependable tool in the marketing mix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about how many emails you clear from your personal inbox on a daily basis – it’s likely upwards of 20. This can get understandably frustrating, especially if you haven’t invited this form of communication. It’s for this reason that consumers and regulators alike have become protective of the inboxes of consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2003, then-President George W. Bush introduced the CAN-SPAM (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing) Act in response to a growing number of consumer complaints. The law became the first set of guidelines for commercial email communication in the U.S. and is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does this impact your business? If you’re sending emails to potential, existing, or former customers in the U.S., you&#8217;ll want to read on. It might help you avoid a hefty fine. </span></p>

<h2><b>What is CAN-SPAM?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CAN-SPAM Act spells out the rules around how businesses can promote their products or services to consumers through email marketing. It gives consumers the right to stop hearing from you and lets businesses know what consequences are in store if they don’t comply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Act stretches beyond mass emailing marketing, covering individual electronic business communication as well as messages from internet-to-phone (SMS). More specifically, CAN-SPAM covers “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any electronic mail message the primary purpose of which is the commercial advertisement or promotion of a commercial product or service.” This includes business to business email marketing.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Dos and Don’ts of CAN-SPAM</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, like most customer-focused business practices, CAN-SPAM rules are pretty intuitive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can think about them in the context of the three stages of the email experience: receiving the email, reading the email, and choosing to opt-out. </span></p>
<h2><b>Receiving Emails</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a customer first receives an email from you, they must be able to clearly identify who the sender is and what the email is about. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “From” field of your email needs to explicitly state your business name and the name of the person sending the email. This information can’t be considered false or misleading. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your subject line needs to give your customers a good idea of what they’ll find inside. Don’t mask a promotional email as a transactional one. If the email content is sexually explicit, this needs to be made clear in the subject line.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Reading Emails </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a customer opens your email, they must know where your business is located, whether the email is promotional in nature, and how they can opt-out of receiving emails in the future.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email body must include your business’ physical mailing address. This can be your street address or a registered postal box address. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to clearly and visibly identify that the email is an advertisement. While this doesn’t necessarily have to be done in the subject line, you need to make it transparent enough to avoid any confusion. If the customers on your mailing list have agreed to hear from you, then you don’t have to label the email as an ad, but you do need to meet all other CAN-SPAM requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customers should be able to find and understand exactly how to opt-out of your mailing list. They should be able to do this within one step, by either visiting an external page or replying to your email without having to give you anything in return. Don’t use font size or color to make opting out difficult. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Opting Out of Emails </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a customer has decided to opt-out of your emails, you need to have a process in place that can quickly act on their request. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must let your customers opt-out of your mailing list for at least 30 days after the email is sent. You need to be able to process the opt-out request within 10 business days. At this point, you can’t transfer their email to any third-party business unless it’s a business helping you comply with regulations.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that even if you outsource your email marketing, your business is ultimately responsible for complying with the CAN-SPAM Act.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Transactional Versus Commercial Emails </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Act </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> differentiate between a transactional or relationship email and a commercial or promotional email. Some examples of transactional emails are when you send customers a confirmation of purchase, let them know an invoice is available, or alert them to changing terms or service updates. Commercial emails are the ones you send that promote a product or service, even if it’s just sharing your most recent blog posts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re sending an email that combines transactional and promotional messaging, you need to keep in mind the primary purpose of the email. If the primary purpose is transactional, then the only rules you need to comply with is a clear subject line and “From” field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is an example of a transactional email from the FTC website. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_10044" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10044" class="wp-image-10044 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM.png" alt="Email example from ftc.gov" width="815" height="277" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM.png 815w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM-300x102.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM-768x261.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10044" class="wp-caption-text">Email example from ftc.gov</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the primary purpose of the email is promotional, then you’ll need to fully comply with all CAN-SPAM rules. Below is an example of a commercial or promotional email. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_10045" style="width: 825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10045" class="wp-image-10045 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM-1.png" alt="example of email from ftc.gov" width="815" height="277" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM-1.png 815w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM-1-300x102.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-12-at-5.03.53-PM-1-768x261.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10045" class="wp-caption-text">Email example from ftc.gov</p></div></p>
<h2><b>What are the Consequences for Violating the Act?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be charged up to $42,530 for every email that doesn’t comply with the CAN-SPAM Act. The FTC can also make your penalty public, potentially causing reputational damage. </span></p>
<h2><b>What Does This Mean for Your Business?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If email marketing is important for your business, be aware of the rules of engagement. Parts of the law are flexible and open to interpretation, so it’s best to err on the side of caution. Educate yourself on the finer details, especially if your business buys mailing lists or is planning to run a campaign asking customers to forward your email to friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that the CAN-SPAM Act was born from consumer frustration, so don’t just think about it as a pesky legal compliance – consider it another way to put the customer experience center stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information or FAQ, read the </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTC’s Compliance Guide for Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name implies, UX Designers are focused on user experience — how a product, like a website or app, makes you feel while you’re using it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring that out takes research, prototyping, and testing, with this high-level role working closely alongside other types of Designers and Product Managers to bring each vision to life in a way that resonates with end-users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/6-stages-ux-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Tony Ho Tran</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Inside Design, every modern, successful product or service needs UX design behind it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With it, customers will remain satisfied and (ideally) loyal to your business,” he writes. “Without it, your user can be left frustrated and bitter with your product… resulting in, ultimately, fewer users.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tran says the most effective UX design creates a positive experience for a company’s target audience by anticipating — and ultimately fulfilling — their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s the actual UX design process to make that happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most UX Designers break the process down into a few key stages, which allows a team to figure out user needs, develop and test ideas, and refine a design so it has the maximum impact.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understand the Problem</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the good old days of high school, when you were given math problems or essay topics to tackle? Step one, before hitting pen to paper, was always making sure you understood the question and the parameters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just like those school days, UX design process also requires gaining a thorough understanding of the issue at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Design solves a problem,” explains </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saadia Minhas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for UX Planet. “In order to provide a solution, you first need to understand the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In UX design, that can mean interviewing clients and brainstorming concepts together, determining what problem you’re trying to solve for your company, their company, and the end-users, and bringing together the project team to get everyone on the same page before the hard work really begins.</span></p>
<h2><b>Research and Analyze</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-depth research is the backbone of UX design, long before you’re building prototypes or signing off on graphic design choices. Some of this means scoping out your competitors to get a sense of their product offerings, including their shortcomings and any potential sources of inspiration, while another chunk is focused on end-users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your user research is going to be the lifeblood of your project,” explains Tran. “The things you discover and unearth during this stage lays the foundation for how your entire project will turn out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it through surveys, focus groups, or 1-on-1 meetings, you need to get a clear sense of what users want and need from the product you’re designing. That means focusing on questions like what they’re hoping for in a product, and what they struggle with when it comes to current market offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only do UX Designers want to know who their users are, but Designers want to dive deeper into their needs, fears, motivations, and behavior,” </span><a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/ux-process-what-it-is-what-it-looks-like-and-why-its-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">writes Nick Babich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Adobe’s design blog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this phase, it can be helpful to create user personas — as in, fictional representations of your target customers — to give you a clear guideline for what you’re trying to achieve.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sketch and Design</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the phase where you’re finally hashing out ideas — and while they don’t have to be perfect, they should be rooted in your research, with a laser-sharp focus on solving the problem at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whiteboard flows, wireframe prototypes, and often hand-drawn sketches can all be part of the process so you can share concepts with your team and other stakeholders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the process moves forward, you’ll start getting into the nitty-gritty of a final design, hammering out specifics like typography and style guidelines with your graphic and UI design team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Babich, an effective design phase is both highly collaborative, requiring input from the whole product development team, and iterative, meaning that it cycles back upon itself to validate ideas and assumptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll have to design, redesign, scrap it, and design it all again,” Minhas echoes. “Hyperventilation and overconsumption of coffee are completely natural at this stage.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Test, launch, repeat</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve finished building a final design, backed by research and analysis, you’re almost ready to send it into the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, though, comes plenty of testing — ensuring every single piece of the product is usable and effective. Ultimately, you’re trying to figure out if it works well, resonates with customers, and if it solves your initial problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so requires a few approaches, according to Tran: Internal testing, end-user testing, and potentially a beta launch. “This is a limited release of your product to a small number of people with the goal of finding issues and cleaning them up before you launch it to the world,” he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In UX, tests can be as simple as observing customer-product interactions or as complex as presenting different versions of a product to the public to see which is better received, </span><a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/ux-design-process-beginners-guide-user-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes UsabilityGeek.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Developers may offer questionnaires and surveys or even do further interviews with customers to identify spots of difficulty or confusion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this point, your team might decide it’s time to officially press the “launch” button. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, sorry to break it to you, that’s not where the process ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process goes on until the desired experience and customer satisfaction is achieved,” Minhas writes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, testing, re-launching, and then testing again — getting as close to an ideal product offering as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When it comes to UX design process, there’s no one fits all solution,” says Babich. “But whether your UX process lightweight or it’s full of a lot of activities, the goal of each UX design process is the same — create a great product for your users.”</span></p>
