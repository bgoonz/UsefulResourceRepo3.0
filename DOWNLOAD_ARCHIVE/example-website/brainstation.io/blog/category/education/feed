								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The stories of managing a work-life balance during a pandemic are plentiful and profound. The challenge of balancing ever-changing priorities is only magnified in the lives of parents raising young children.&nbsp;We wanted to take a moment to recognize the amazing parents pivoting their careers during a pandemic and graduated from a <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses">BrainStation Online Bootcamp</a>; a feat that shouldn’t go unnoticed.</p>



<p>They’ve continued to go above and beyond and have shared their experiences, with advice for fellow parents who are thinking about learning new skills and changing their careers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why Start a New Challenge?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many reasons why parents may decide to take on a bootcamp. For some, losing a job during a pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to tackle something new and earn a new career. Others saw their growing family as the spark they needed to make a career transition.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JS0d1EMh8enZ2FHOhkjNWnMQUsugGgMokakbN3bpbqqKtklwLn9xHUcdpTZGgxIxCYvEzR-bnkWN8xuhKAM1qAoycMBw0jukBPpEgM8Khw7XT1xPC5A5JHCeHgWmsacfN1ozlxMy" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development</a> graduate Jessica Kwok started the bootcamp with a background in Kinesiology and saw maternity leave as the perfect time to jump into a new career. She shared that finding remote learning was a big factor. “As a new mom, being able to do the bootcamp remotely was a major priority for me,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ultimately chose BrainStation because they were well versed in delivering content online (even before Covid!) and had an impressive growing alumni network.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elyse Renouf has a background in business consulting and recently graduated from our <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp">Data Science Bootcamp</a>. She shared that Covid-19 layoffs, daycare closures, and a desire for a more technical role that could be remote was the perfect storm to spur the need for a change and take on a course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tight and Tricky Schedules</h2>



<p>So what does studying while being a parent look like? Think packed schedules, lots of help from friends and family, and getting creative with distracting little ones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12735" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-300x258.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-768x661.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1536x1322.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-960x827.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Angus Ryer, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development </a>Graduate with a history in construction, shared his schedule:</p>



<ul><li>Wake up to my nine-month old crying</li><li>Go wake up my three-year old</li><li>Get breakfast ready, eat together, take the boys out for a walk while my wife works out</li><li>Make coffee number two</li><li>Hop online for class at 10:30 am</li><li>Listen intently and work on projects until 1 pm</li><li>Help my older boy get settled into a nap</li><li>Power through classes from 2:00 pm to 6:30 pm&nbsp;</li><li>Spend some time with my kids, eat dinner (made with love by my wife), and then settle my older one into bed</li><li>&#8220;Relax&#8221; on the couch with my wife, half-distracted by MasterChef Australia or InkMasters while I continued to study work in the concepts I had learned</li><li>Rinse and repeat!</li></ul>



<p>Other parents shared similar busy schedules, commenting that despite the lack of personal time, it was all worth it to have a brand new bootcamp credentials in only three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s scary. That&#8217;s natural. The biggest rewards usually come from the biggest risks,” said Armando Pastorin, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">UX Design Bootcamp</a> Graduate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This process is mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting for everyone,” Renouf admits. With the mix of parenting and household responsibilities while studying, it can be tempting to doubt your decision or want to quit. Luckily, her son helped provide the motivation she needed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12737" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-300x160.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-768x408.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1536x817.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-960x510.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“I did this course and am making this career change so I can get to see him more so despite how overwhelming it was at the time, I truly believe it was all worth it.”</p>



<h2>Advice for Parents Going Back to School&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Each parent was keen to share advice for other parents looking to learn remotely. Here are some of our favorite tips:</p>



<p>“Surround yourself with people who can encourage and support you along the way. As much as we&#8217;d all like to be the &#8220;super-mom&#8221; or &#8220;super-dad&#8221; who single handedly got through a bootcamp while watching your child full time, having people who can help you out and root for you is extremely valuable to your success.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<p>“Take help where needed from your family, friends or whoever you like to get some quiet time to finish your work. During my Coffee and Conversation sessions, I came across a lot of parents from different cohorts, with whom I would exchange ideas on time management and so much more which helped me a lot. &#8221; &#8211; Bonney Halani</p>



<p>“Set a schedule leading up to the program and help your kids get into that routine, so that they expect you to be focused at specific times. Kids (and grown-ups) tend to go crazy if they don&#8217;t get enough attention, so by committing to giving them the right amount of time, it&#8217;s easier to give yourself periods of focus without the kids tugging at your pant legs.” &#8211; Angus Ryer</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any sitters, no family, and at first, no daycare, and it was madness. If you can, identify where you can make your life a little smoother by either meal prepping, freezing leftovers, or ordering take out to save time. Keep snacks on your desk and relax your screen time rules (a good tablet/headphones really are your best friend in survival mode.&#8221; &#8211; Elyse Renouf</p>



<p>“Block off dedicated family time and actually stick to it.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12738" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-768x606.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-960x757.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Photo Credit: Sammie Chan (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=en">@sammiechn</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>



<p>For parents deciding to use their extra time to upskill, taking some ‘me time’ is all the more important. Pastorin did this by dedicating one evening of the week to himself. “Every Tuesday evening was my time to go out and refresh the brain with something completely unrelated to work.”<br></p>



<p>Kwok started a workout group, initiated a Zoom workout group with a few friends to keep each other accountable for a 30-minute workout, three times a week.</p>



<p>Whatever shape your ‘me time’ takes, don’t put it on the back burner! Even super parents need a break.</p>



<h2>What Comes Next</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the specific needs of a person’s demanding day-to-day are different for everyone. But these incredible parents are proof that if you are determined, committed, and perhaps a little crafty, you can achieve your goals with your family and future in mind.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know by now that workplace learning and development programs are essential to any company’s long-term success. But how do we know if a training program is effective? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short answer is data, and more specifically, something called learning and development (L&amp;D) analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">L&amp;D analytics allow us to analyze the effectiveness of training and understand how it correlates to employee engagement, productivity, and overall company success.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is L&amp;D Analytics? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">L&amp;D analytics lives under a broader umbrella of workplace </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which uses predictive and prescriptive analytics and machine learning to help us make predictions and decisions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting this kind of data-driven approach to learning can help your company answer a number of complex skills training questions, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which employees require more support? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the rate of employee turnover in relation to trainings completed?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which style of learning is most effective for my team members?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How have these trainings affected overall business revenue? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach can also help create personalized learning experiences, and improve comprehension and subject matter retention. BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/synapse-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, is a fully data-driven learning platform, which tracks course comprehension and progress, and encourages student feedback, allowing instructors to develop personalized learning experiences for each student.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How L&amp;D Analytics Can Benefit Your Business </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing L&amp;D analytics and a more data-driven approach to employee training can help your company develop a culture of learning, which can benefit your business in two key areas: improved employee engagement and better business decision-making. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, when employees feel that their long-term career goals are supported by their employers, they are less likely to leave. In fact, 70 percent of workers today cite job-related training and development opportunities as a reason for staying at a job. This goes up to 87 percent for millenials, who, it should be noted, now make up the largest portion of the workforce. This is made all the more important when you consider that 43 percent of employed </span><a href="http://www.apaexcellence.org/assets/general/2017-training-survey-results.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are concerned about the changing nature of work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a data-driven approach to learning, companies can now make informed decisions about what sort of training to provide – is this what the team wants and needs? Will it address the team’s weaknesses? Once you’ve identified gaps and relevant skills to develop for the future, L&amp;D analytics can then be used to compare training and revenue, with questions like these:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do training results compare at our best performing stores, versus the worst?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What impact, if any, does the amount of training hours have on sales? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What impact does the amount of training hours have on employee turnover?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers to questions like these will often justify, and in fact encourage, investment in employee training and help create long-term growth strategies – for both your employees and the company as a whole. TELUS, one of Canada’s fastest-growing telecommunications companies, provides a good example. The company used a number of employee surveys to develop a culture of learning, and a robust training program, featuring a number of contextual learning tools and platforms, including its own internal versions of YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Following these kinds of investments, the company saw employee retention improved by 30 percent.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How do I Implement L&amp;D analytics Into my Workplace? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting a data-driven LMS platform like Synapse is the easiest way to start benefiting from L&amp;D analytics in the workplace, particularly if you don&#8217;t already have a Data Scientist or data team in place. If you’d rather have someone on board to dig deeper into the data, we recently wrote about </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-hire-a-data-scientist" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to hire a Data Scientist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That post took a look at the hiring process, and highlighted the importance of developing a strategy. The same approach is useful when it comes to implementing L&amp;D analytics into the workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you’ll need to map out your goals and objectives, as well as a timeline. Identify the key stakeholders in this decision, developing an approach that would appeal to them. It’s extremely important to ensure that your strategy aligns with your company’s overall business objectives: organizations that </span><a href="https://trainingindustry.com/articles/measurement-and-analytics/implementing-a-learning-analytics-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“are good at strategic alignment get between three and five times higher performance output.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to consider the context of your company’s work environment (read: office politics!) and any cultural factors that may come into play. Identify your resources and the current capacity of team members who may take on this project. If you’ve got someone on your team who is a whiz at Excel or Python, this may be a great time to retrain or promote a junior employee into a new position as a Data Analyst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, develop an evaluation system. That means that you are monitoring the results of L&amp;D programs, and also how well your new system is working for your team internally. Schedule regular reviews to make sure your system is running as effectively as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing a system of L&amp;D analytics is crucial for today’s businesses, not only in the area of professional development but also in business growth. By working with a skilled Analyst to collect and analyze relevant data, your business can begin to make informed, data-driven decisions, resulting in higher employee engagement and, ultimately, increased revenue. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee turnover is something all companies battle with, but there’s a tool in your arsenal to fight back: Skills training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s personal development courses or <a href="https://brainstation.io/corporate-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accelerated corporate training</a>, employee skills training can keep people engaged, empowered, and happy at work, which ultimately boosts employee retention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a closer look at how skills training can help you fight employee turnover. </span></p>
<h3><b>Skills Training Mitigates Feelings of Digital Anxiety</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-gb/articles/digital-transformation/creating-the-right-company-culture-for-digital-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study commissioned by Microsoft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 49 percent of employees fear change when digital transformation initiatives are introduced; 59 percent are concerned about job security where tasks are automated; and 39 percent feel anxious when new technology is introduced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To mitigate this, the Microsoft study suggested that companies and managers follow this course of action: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emphasize the collaborative potential of new digital technologies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow people to experience new technologies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarify how new technologies will fit in your organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish a culture of continuous improvement and innovation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we&#8217;ve written about, <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-employee-training-can-help-your-digital-transformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regular digital skills training</a> is the easiest way to put these suggestions into action, as it empowers employees with skills and hands-on experience, and establishes a company culture that is open to new ideas and learning. </span></p>
<h3><b>It Keeps the Job Interesting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter someone’s role or paycheque — be it a front-end <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/intro-to-web-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web developer</a> or vice-president of the company — doing the same job every day can get a little stagnant. And it’s particularly true if the job doesn’t include new challenges or opportunities to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, in turn, can lead to feelings of boredom, and research shows that’s bad news. “The more work-related boredom employees experience, the more they intend to leave the job,” concludes </span><a href="http://isarder.org/2018/vol.10_issue.1_article32_extensive_summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one 2018 study on boredom at work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, employee training can break that cycle of boredom. “New experiences don&#8217;t always have to come with promotions or vertical projects,” says career coach Eileen Chadnick, principal of Big Cheese Coaching. “It can be gaining exposure to a new skill or new software.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Useful, engaging training allows people to break out of their daily routine and use their brain in a different way — and that’s a job benefit many people don’t want to give up, according to Sarah Vermunt, a career coach and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Careergasm: Find Your Way To Feel-Good Work.</span></i></p>
<h3><b>It Helps Employees Grow</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture this: A graphic designer with a decade of experience whose role now involves the same client base every year, and the same corporate promotional materials to design month after month. After doing that work for a while, that employee might start to feel a little creatively stifled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a situation that’s often overlooked, but not ideal for companies: Coupled with boredom, feeling stunted in a job is another common reason people hit the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As human beings, we all have an innate ability to grow and evolve,” says Chadnick. “When we’re not evolving ourselves, we&#8217;re not actualizing our potential and life can become pretty flat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-actualization might sound like a lofty goal, but Chadnick says employers can actually contribute to this growth and reduce turnover in their employees through training opportunities for their teams.</span></p>
<h3><b>It Gives Workers a Reboot</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get ready in the morning. Grab a coffee. Hurry to work. Sit in traffic. Rush to a meeting, rush to a client call, rush to finish projects before the workday ends. Hurry home, crash, repeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That go-go-go workplace culture can be downright exhausting for employees, and research shows those that are most caught up in their busy jobs can be the most burnt out. </span><a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/many-highly-engaged-employees-suffer-from-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2018 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 1,000 American workers finds that many employees who are highly engaged in their work are also exhausted — and ready to quit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee training may be part of a job, but Vermunt says it’s a totally different vibe that can give employees a boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How, exactly? By giving people an opportunity to step away from the daily grind and immerse themselves in new ideas, she explains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It refreshes the rest of your work,” Vermunt says.</span></p>
<h3><b>It Ensures Employees Feel Valued</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard stories about people feeling undervalued by their boss or overlooked by senior management. But when people vent about those workplace frustrations, they’re not always talking about a promotion or a pay raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling appreciated is also a big factor in employee retention, according to Chadnick. And training can help build those fuzzy feelings in a company’s staff, she adds, because it’s a signal to employees that their company wants to invest in their growth on more than just an economic level — it shows they’re an important part of the team in the long-term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s maybe a little sense of — I don&#8217;t want to say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">loyalty</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — but you gain a bit more commitment from an employee,” Chadnick says.</span></p>
<h3><b>It Builds Corporate Culture</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/256539" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one 2017 study,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s a direct connection between organizational culture and employee retention — and that’s a wake-up call for companies to make sure their employees feel like they’re working in a positive corporate culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what makes a positive corporate culture, exactly? For many employees, it’s often based on enjoying their time at work and their interactions with colleagues. “People want to be part of a team,” says Chadnick. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training sessions help boost that sense of camaraderie, she adds. “People meet others in the company, it creates congeniality and builds new relationships and community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also creates a new conversation starter for workers, like sharing their newfound ability to code in HTML with peers or using Google Adwords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While training fosters a positive culture internally, Vermunt says there’s another perk as well: Employees working in that type of atmosphere are also inclined to rave about their job to others, which could not only reduce turnover of current employees but also encourage other all-star workers to join the company as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If an organization has a reputation for training and development, that can actually help recruitment,” says Vermunt.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, it seemed the MBA – or the master of business administration degree – was the ultimate goal for anyone looking to make a splash in the business world. That, however, seems to be changing, and rapidly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study from the London-based firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrington Crisp</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that students across the globe are now favoring more specialized programs over the more generalist MBA. After surveying almost 1,300 students from 39 countries, the firm found that 53 percent preferred specialized programs, with information technology, finance, and entrepreneurship the most popular specialties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of reasons for this shift. Here’s why specialized skills training is giving the once-mighty MBA a run for its money.</span></p>
<h2><b>MBA Programs Are Losing Their Lustre</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it’s worth noting that the MBA is far from DOA. Nearly 200,000 students in the U.S. alone have been awarded a master’s degree in business annually since 2010, making it the most popular post-graduate degree in the country. In 2011-12, the last year for which the U.S. Department of Education provides information, 25.4 percent of all master’s degrees conferred were in business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it’s hard to argue the MBA has not seen a decline in popularity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business schools in the United States have experienced a precipitous </span><a href="https://poetsandquants.com/2018/08/29/mba-apps-take-a-shocking-plunge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drop in applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rice University’s Jones Graduate School, as one example provided by Poets &amp; Quants, saw candidates to its full-time programs plummet by 27.7 percent. According to the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/m-b-a-applications-keep-falling-in-u-s-this-year-hitting-even-elite-schools-1538366461" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even the titans of the educational industry are suffering; Harvard Business School saw a 4.5 percent dip in applications, while Wharton declined 6.7 percent and Stanford’s Graduate School of Business dropped 4.6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as students seem to be looking elsewhere, the MBA is also becoming less coveted by employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey by the Graduate Management Admission Council </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/m-b-a-graduates-enter-tougher-job-market-1529959689?mod=hp_lead_pos4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that just 85 percent of U.S. employers intended to hire MBA grads in 2018, down from 91 percent the year before. That might look like a rather subtle dip, but in fact, it’s the biggest decline in business-school recruitment since the dawn of the last recession.</span></p>
<h2><b>MBA Programs Are Expensive </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting an MBA is not cheap. The average tuition for a two-year MBA program in the U.S. exceeds $60,000, and the top business schools might charge as much as $100,000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common thinking used to be that the exorbitant cost of acquiring an MBA would be worth it upon graduation when the credential all-but-guaranteed a lucrative payoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, too, seems to be changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from Poets &amp; Quants shows that the value-added ratio for full-time MBA programs has </span><a href="https://poetsandquants.com/2018/03/21/the-alarming-decline-of-the-mbas-value-added-ratio/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fallen dramatically over the years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning the margin between the salary bump offered by completing an MBA program and the steep cost of tuition is slimmer than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 44.2 million Americans now carrying </span><a href="https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">student loan debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of more than $1.48 trillion collectively, it’s little wonder so many students are wary of spending six figures on a post-graduate degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even billionaire businessman Marc Cuban emphasizes that there might be more cost-efficient ways for learners to boost their education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not a fan of getting MBAs at all,” he </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/27/mark-cuban-on-whether-getting-an-mba-is-worth-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the 2018 Turning Point USA High School Leadership Summit. “There are so many online ways to learn and I think you can get far more experience in the workforce and learn more and be in a better position to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because realize,” he added, “there are so many online MBA equivalents that if you are disciplined enough, you can do it for a lot less money and still get a quality education.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Education Now Needs to Be Continuous </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who have already started their careers, the notion of going back to school full-time for an MBA can range from impractical to impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s motivating many to look beyond traditional university graduate programs to part-time, online, or shorter-term credentials, including certificate courses, diploma programs, and other similarly concise educational opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those who do attain MBAs can’t possibly expect that it will be the end of their educational journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The world of work is changing,” Carrington Crisp co-founder Andrew Crisp </span><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-specialty-programs-give-the-mba-a-run-for-its-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Globe and Mail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Doing an MBA at 29 and thinking that is the end of it is just a preposterous notion. People will need retraining or additional skills at 45, 65, and they won’t retire until 75, so what are they the things they need and how will the MBA fit into that?”</span></p>
<h2><b>MBA Programs Are Not Specialized Enough</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the Carrington Crisp report found that modern learners often have specific skills, competencies, or qualifications in mind when they pursue post-secondary education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students are seeking something that will help with a specific career they have in mind and a specialist degree, perhaps with part-exemption from a professional body qualification as part of the degree, will help them stand out in a highly competitive jobs market,” Crisp said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Career is key and part of that is the ROI of study, which can be multiplied by cheaper study costs on shorter courses. And recruiters have a better understanding of the value of shorter, specialized programs rather than focusing solely on the MBA.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation, for instance, offers a range of learning options, with <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full-time diploma programs and part-time certification courses</a> – both on-campus and online – in areas including data, design, development, marketing, and product. Accelerated training programs are also available for design thinking, Google AdWords, Google Analytics, SEO, and Agile Methodology, among others, to help professionals level up their skills, quickly and effectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One size doesn’t fit all,” Crisp said. “That speaks to the personalization agenda. The idea that you will have a mass-market MBA with fairly standard components – there are very few of those that will succeed in the future.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, thirty eminent professors and doctors of psychology and neuroscience published an</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/12/no-evidence-to-back-idea-of-learning-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in The Guardian declaring the concept of learning styles a ‘neuromyth.’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What these scientists were so bothered about is the theory that individual learners have a predominant style or modality through which they learn most effectively. This idea originates from a couple of different sources. One is psychologist </span><a href="http://resources.eln.io/david-kolb-learning-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Kolb’s 1984 model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the experiential learning cycle, which categorizes learners into Assimilators, Accomodators, Divergers, or Convergers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another source is the VARK (Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic) </span><a href="http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionnaire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created by school inspector Neil Fleming in the early ‘90s, which asks people how they prefer to receive information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the point of origin, the concept of learning styles has become ingrained in popular culture. A 2013 study by the Wellcome Trust found that 76 percent of teachers in the UK used learning styles in their teaching. In 2014, another study claimed over 90% of teachers in five countries (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Turkey, Greece, and China) believed individuals learn better when receiving information tailored to their preferred style. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the British Council and the BBC have bought in, urging teachers on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TeachingEnglish website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to match their student’s learning styles, including being: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">right- or left-brained</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, analytic vs. dynamic, and visual vs. auditory.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Wrong With Learning Styles?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2009, </span><a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/pspi/PSPI_9_3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harold Pashler and his team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found there was “virtually no evidence for” learning styles. Surveying an enormous body of literature, Pashler’s team found that hardly any of it actually used sound experimental methodologies to test the theory; the few studies that did do so contradicted categorization into ‘learning styles.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pashler’s results were corroborated most recently </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ase.1777" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this study by Polly Hussman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and her team. Hussman had over 400 anatomy students take the VARK questionnaire, then monitored the students’ study habits and course results. Most students’ study strategies did not match their professed ‘learning style,’ and even when the two aligned it didn’t correlate with higher course achievements. “Another nail in the coffin for learning styles?” asks the title of Hussman’s published findings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, there are differences in aptitudes and abilities amongst learners. It’s also true that people express preferences for verbal or visual teaching methods, for example. But it turns out that these preferences are simply not predictive of people’s actual aptitudes. As </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Kraemer’s team discovered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, how people think they learn does not match how they actually learn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a study published by British Journal of Psychology, students who claimed to be visual and verbal learners thought they would remember pictures and words better, but those preferences had no correlation to what they actually remembered best. The ‘learning style’ simply meant was that they liked words or pictures better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make matters worse, there is evidence that the myth of learning styles is actually causing harm, encouraging teachers to teach to students’ intellectual strengths rather than their weaknesses,” as Scott Lilienfeld wrote in </span><a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002362.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, How</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People Learn?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychologist Daniel Willingham suggests that </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all kinds of learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be promoted and practiced, so that students can strengthen an array of skills, then use whatever is most effective for the problem at hand. “It’s much better,” he says, “to think of everyone having a toolbox of ways to think.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to do this, is to promote “active learning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Courses for Adults: Design for Learning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, author and professor Ralf St. Clair pulled together a number of theories to create what he calls a “highly coherent working model” on learning. St. Clair believes that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning is a social process</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People learn by trying peripheral activities, then, as they grow in confidence (and watch others), they take on more complex activities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People repeat actions associated with a reward, including peer approval.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An associated behavioral outcome can make learning easier.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People learn best when faced with a need to understand something relevant to them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on these ideas, St. Clair outlined three suggestions for teachers and students alike, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing people to have some control over their own learning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building connections between the material and the experiences of learners, with increasing complexity. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraging collaboration and feedback between learners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These ideas are very much at the heart of BrainStation’s learning experience, which encourages a hands-on, project-based learning environment, emphasizing collaboration and outcomes-based skills development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating this kind of experience for learners can be challenging, which may be why the concept of ‘learning styles’ took off in the first place. It, does, after all, have a certain attraction, as </span><a href="https://career.ucsf.edu/sites/career.ucsf.edu/files/Article%20UCSF%20SEJC%20January%202017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willingham has written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as a “middle ground between treating every student the same way and treating every student uniquely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth, though, is that, in Willingham’s words, “learning styles theories have not panned out.” </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, most tech professionals know that re-training and up-skilling is a must to stay ahead of innovation and an ever-shifting job market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the cost of a certification course or digital skills training is holding you back, why not see if your employer will foot the bill? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about how </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-to-fight-employee-turnover-skills-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital skills training can fight employee turnover</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and increasingly, companies are setting aside room in their budgets for staff training and re-education. If your boss still needs some convincing, here are some points that might help persuade them to invest in you.</span></p>
<p><b>Other Companies are Reaping the Benefits</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies around the world are now encouraging and assisting employees to continue their education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2018 survey from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">World at Work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 92 percent of responding organizations offered programs supporting classroom learning, while 85 percent offered some form of tuition reimbursement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There also seems to be a correlation between investing in education and overall organizational success. According to a 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital trends study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Adobe and Econsultancy, 45 percent of “top-performing” companies pledged to invest in digital skills and education, while among lower-performing companies, the number was only 23 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A compelling case example is Discover Financial Services. As explored in a 2016 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumina Foundation study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Discover provided employees $7.4 million in tuition reimbursement from 2010 to 2013. The study found that the program produced an overall 144 percent ROI as a result of “avoided talent management costs” such as higher rates of promotion, transfers and retention, and lower rates of absenteeism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, employees who participated in the program received average annual wage increases that were at least 41 percent higher than non-participating employees. Overall, Discover saved $10.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program was so successful, Discover chose to expand eligibility in 2017 to its newest hires. </span></p>
<p><b>You’ll be a Better – and Happier – Employee</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, upgrading your skillset and updating your education will make you a more valuable employee. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Destiny Solutions poll</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 200 North American employers found that 70 percent of leaders said employees needed continuous learning simply to keep pace with their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not just the new skills and competencies that will make you more effective. The Society for Human Resource Management’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement survey</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 43 percent of workers ranked their organization’s commitment to professional development as “very important.” And it stands to reason that happy employees will also be more loyal and perform better on the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As just one example, fast-casual chain Chipotle expanded its long-established education benefits program with a new credit-for-training program in July 2016. Five months later, Chipotle had an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">89 percent retention rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among employees who utilized the program – nearly twice the rate of those who didn’t. Participants were also twice as likely as non-participants to be promoted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A year into the program, we are hearing tremendous feedback from our employees and seeing strong results in terms of enrollment, retention, and internal promotions among employees who are participating in the program,” said Steve Ells, Chipotle’s Founder, Chairman, and CEO.</span></p>
<p><b>They Can Leverage Tax Benefits and Incentives</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as a supportive organization will see the benefit in emboldening employees with education, it never hurts to offer a reminder of the financial upside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, there are </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b#en_US_2017_publink1000193667"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extensive tax incentives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for employers who want to help their employees re-educate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an employer pays an employee’s tuition costs – as well as books, equipment, fees, and supplies – the amount is completely deductible as a business expense as long as it’s job-related. Even if it’s not job-related, businesses can deduct up to $5,250 per year per employee as long as it has an educational assistance program in place. The program does need to meet a few requirements, including one that specifies that it can’t favor highly paid employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an employee, there are other educational credits that can help you. If you’re unsure which credits you might be eligible for, try the IRS’s handy </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/am-i-eligible-to-claim-an-education-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interactive tax assistant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool to see which credits you might be able to claim, including the American Opportunity Tax Credit, the Lifetime Learning Credit, and tuition and fees deduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Canada, meanwhile, the </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/job-grant/employers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Job Grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers funding toward the cost of training, with the government shouldering two-thirds of the cost of an employee’s training up to a maximum of $10,000 per grant. In some provinces – including British Columbia – the government covers an even greater percentage of the cost of training.</span></p>
<p><b>Both the Employer and Employee Can See Results – Fast</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s understandable that an organization might be wary of supporting employees through a lengthy degree program. But increasingly, there are digital skills training companies and bootcamps that can seriously upgrade your skills in a short period of time with a flexible array of study options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation, for instance, offers certificate courses in five disciplines: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-science?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowAppleHires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowAppleHires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/intro-to-web-development?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowAppleHires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/digital-marketing?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowAppleHires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital marketing</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/product-management?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_HowAppleHires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">product management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>It’s the Right Thing to Do</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the myriad financial and performance benefits, some employers are coming around to the idea that helping employees pursue an education is simply good for society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the U.S. to remain a leader in the knowledge economy, all providers of education beyond high school, especially employers, must help more Americans earn post-secondary credentials,” said </span><a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/news-and-views/2016-04-22-cigna-education-reimbursement-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Engler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, president of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of major U.S. corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employers can make an outsized impact through providing tuition support.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call it what you want — Robogeddon? the Robopocalypse? — it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">now accepted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automation will have a large impact on the job market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Brookfield Institute </span><a href="https://brookfieldinstitute.ca/research-analysis/automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates the number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Canadian jobs at risk over the next two decades at 42 percent, while a widely-cited </span><a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study out of Oxford University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts the figure for US jobs at 47 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mechanical automation has been eliminating jobs for centuries—at least as far back as the invention of the steam engine—but artificial intelligence (AI) is qualitatively different; it rivals the capabilities of humans mind as well as their bodies — just take a look at </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this recent video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of an automated voice assistant and you’ll see why the Oxford study put the odds that robots will soon displace human telemarketers at 99 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, just as mechanical automation gave rise to new industries and job markets (while it decimated others), the expanding frontier of artificial intelligence demands that we adapt along with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, then, how do you survive the coming robot invasion? Here are two important ideas that can help inoculate your career against automation.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understand the Limitations of AI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk recently</span><a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/elon-musk-clarifies-that-ai-regulation-should-follow-observation-and-insight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called AI “an existential threat to humanity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which isn’t going to do much to keep people calm. He may very well be right, but it’s important to understand that AI still has very real limitations (which gives you time to adapt). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The deep learning systems we have&#8230;are remarkable in how well [they] do given the particular tasks that we give them, but they are actually quite narrow and brittle in their scope. So I think it’s important to keep in context how good these systems are, and actually how bad they are too, and how long we have to go until these systems actually pose that kind of a threat,&#8221; Gil Pratt, CEO at the Toyota Institute </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/artificial-intelligence-is-not-as-smart-as-you-or-elon-musk-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The narrow scope of deep learning systems, as Pratt calls it, are partially due to the fact that AI learns from <em>given</em> data. Yes, m<span style="font-weight: 400;">odern AI programs may complete vastly more calculations per second than their predecessors, with much larger data sets, but for now, AI still follows the directions (and data) we give it. They are also usually programmed to perform a clearly defined task, with established parameters. The system <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/19/17027902/google-verily-ai-algorithm-eye-scan-heart-disease-cardiovascular-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmed to predict heart disease</a>, for example, will not be able to able to identify music. </span></p>
<p>AI also struggles with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/22/why-ai-will-need-more-emotional-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emotional intelligence</a> — the ability to read what other people are feeling or thinking and then reacting to that. “Even the most sophisticated AI technologies lack essential factors like emotional intelligence and the ability to contextualize information like human beings,” Naveen Joshi, the founder and CEO of enterprise development company Allerin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-emotional-intelligence-future-ai-naveen-joshi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s creativity. We are, at the moment, in the early stages (or the <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/artificial-intelligence-creativity-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;laughter&#8221; stage&#8221;) </a>of computational creativity, but that may change. In the meantime, though, there is reason to believe that creative work is safe from automation. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to Martin Ford, futurist and author of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the last jobs automation will claim are those that require “genuine creativity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work he&#8217;s describing depends on the kind of  lateral thinking that comes not from taking <i>calculated</i> risks, but from weighing the potential outcomes of scenarios where risks are unknowable — either due to a shortage of information, or the simple fact that nobody has ever tried them before. Put simply, anytime we take a step into the unknown, we rely on the kind of expertise and overarching judgment that the robots have yet to master. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People naively believe that if you take deep learning and scale it 100 times more layers, and add 1000 times more data, a neural net will be able to do anything a human being can do, but that’s just not true,” François Chollet, a researcher at Google </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/greedy-brittle-opaque-and-shallow-the-downsides-to-deep-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Wired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;The systems&#8230;demand huge sets of training data. [And] when a neural net is given a “transfer test”— confronted with scenarios that differ from the examples used in training — it cannot contextualize the situation and frequently breaks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this to say, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are a number of in-demand, digital skills and career paths that depend on the things that can be challenging for AI, including: <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/product-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product managers</a>, who must create and then manage the development process of a product that does not already exist; <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data analysts, </a>who have to determine the appropriate parameters for analysis (before they can even discover anything from a data set), and then apply this insight to situations that often have no pre-established guidelines; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user experience designers</a> and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-interface-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user interface designers</a>, who have to find ways to improve human interaction with technology and digital properties.   </span></p>
<h2><b>Boost Your Data Skills</b></h2>
<p>If you can&#8217;t beat them, join them. Right?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always joke that the safest job on the planet is AI researcher,” Toby Walsh, an AI professor with the University of New South Wales, </span><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-6-most-in-demand-ai-jobs-and-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Tech Republic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When we’ve automated AI researchers, the machines will literally be able to do everything else by definition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do you get into artificial intelligence? By pursuing one foundational field that feeds into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all areas of AI development: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As we recently wrote about, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data science is one of the fastest growing, most in-demand jobs</a> in technology, and with AI, it may soon become even more indispensable.<br />

<p>Victor is a traditionally trained Graphic Designer, but having interviewed for user experience (UX) positions in the past, he found that he lacked some of the research and technical skills he needed to accelerate his career.</p>
<p>We asked him how he learned about BrainStation, and why he&#8217;s taking our <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design">UX Design course.</a></p>
<p><b>BrainStation: What is your education and career background?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victor: I went to university for engineering, but switched programs and ended up completing a degree in biology. I worked as a Lab Technician for a few years before deciding to go back to college in 2013 for a graphic design program. </span></p>
<p><b>What are you up to currently? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I currently work as a freelance Digital designer, and also do some development work. </span></p>
<p><b>Which course are you taking with us?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience Design at the Toronto Campus.</span></p>
<p><b>Why are you taking this course? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am looking to expand my skill set and become a Full-Stack Designer. Beyond visual design, topics like design strategy, research methods, prototyping, mockups, and user testing, are all skills that I&#8217;m looking to add to my arsenal.</span></p>
<p><b>How did you first hear about BrainStation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A friend referred me!</span></p>
<p><b>What aspects of the course are you most interested in?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting hands-on experience with user research, and being able to develop a polished portfolio piece that I can show off to potential employers. The Instructors at BrainStation are really talented and it’s great to get their input on my work. Plus they all work in the industry as UX Designers, so it&#8217;s great to get that kind of insight. </span></p>
<p><b>What sparked your decision to enroll in the course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve interviewed for many UX positions, but my background is in graphic design, and without that relevant UX experience, it’s really tough. A big reason why I enrolled in the course was the chance to get hands-on experience, and to be able to develop portfolio pieces to help me break into the UX field. </span></p>
<p><b>Where do you see yourself after completing the course? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see myself continuing to expand my freelance design practice and/or taking a full-time design position at a company.</span></p>

Her interest in the field had been sparked over four years earlier, when she was working for a technology company, but she wasn&#8217;t able to explore that further — she didn&#8217;t have the skills or education&#8230;that is until she discovered our <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Full-Time Web Development Program</a> in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what she had to say about her experience in the program, and what she&#8217;s up to now working at one of our hiring partners: <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
<p><strong><i>BrainStation: What were you doing before the program?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra: I was doing freelance work as a digital marketer and developing my passion project, an ethical fashion brand. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>What led you to enroll in the Web Development Full-time Program at BrainStation?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had an interest in coding ever since I landed my first job within the tech industry four years ago. The more I got exposed to it the more my curiosity and appreciation grew. In 2017 I has reached a point where I was feeling stuck in my career and wanted new direction. I finally decided to challenge myself and take the plunge into web development. After conducting some research and weighing my options I chose to go with BrainStation. Their curriculum, class structure and company culture clearly had their students’ best interests at heart. I was impressed with their knowledge of the tech landscape at both a local and global level. They have fostered strong ties within the industry over the years and had an excellent reputation.</span></p>

<p><strong><i>What were your feelings going into it on day one?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was nervous because I knew it was going to be challenging but more than that I was excited with anticipation. I knew it would be a memorable experience. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Did you have any prior experience with the content?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had very basic knowledge of javascript but nothing I was too confident about. I did however have a strong foundation on HTML and CSS from my previous employment experience. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>What was your experience like in class?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From day one I knew I had made the right move by choosing BrainStation. The course was well structured and organized. Jonathan was experienced, articulate and visibly invested in our learning process. Our TAs were supportive and knowledgeable, always available and ready to help. There was a good repertoire between the educator and the TAs, which resulted in a comfortable and trusting learning environment. While the content itself was challenging and the pace was fast, we were provided with a variety of useful resources and support. The material we covered was relevant to the contemporary industry needs. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>How has completing this full-time program helped you find work in Vancouver’s growing tech scene?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This course gave me the knowledge and tools needed to begin a new and exciting career. While you can never </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">know</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it all within development, having strong foundations are the key to define which path you will take. Building on our foundations while being constantly challenged was a key takeaway from this course.  You will never be able to fulfil all requirements of a job posting but creating an identity as a developer, working on your strengths and exploring new technologies will catch any employer’s attention. In addition, the camaraderie that was formed in the course went beyond the 10 weeks. I still keep close contact with my classmates and collaborate in projects and continue to learn together. Our shared experiences and interest in coding keep us motivated and on track to reach our goals.  I completed this course feeling prepared to continue learning and keep building on what I had already learned.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Would you recommend this program to others? </i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would 100% recommend this program to others with the disclosure that you have to be motivated and ready to work hard. You will get out of the course only as much as you put in. I don’t feel like not having a computer science degree (or something similar) has held me back in any way, at the end of the day it’s all about experience and a program like this gives you the core theory, but most importantly the practical skills to build a solid portfolio of projects.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>Is there anything else you’d like to add about the experience?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the material was excellent and the education above and beyond I’d like to comment on the community aspect of this experience as well. I believe that the supportive staff at BrainStation and my amazing classmates where what truly made this course a memorable experience. During my time at BrainStation, and even now as an alumnae, I feel I’ve created bonds and fostered relationships that will last a lifetime. And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the biggest takeaway. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>And finally, how was the job search after graduating?</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The job search, although tedious and at times discouraging, was another good learning experience. It showed me what I still need to work on and revealed how much I have already learned. Employers definitely have hesitations about junior developers, since they’re aware we need mentorship and support — sometimes those resources are just not available. But the opportunities are out there, it’s just a matter of persevering and having patience. Overall, the feedback I’ve gotten from companies has been positive and helped understand what areas I need to focus on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation offered a great deal of career and moral support throughout the process and kept me accountable, making sure I didn’t lose momentum or motivation. I’m thrilled to say that I am now in the process of accepting an offer from Slack, something that I would have never thought possible — it’s truly a dream come true. This opportunity is proof that BrainStation was the right career move. I’m excited to see where it goes! </span></p>
