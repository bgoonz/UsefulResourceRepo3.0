								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The stories of managing a work-life balance during a pandemic are plentiful and profound. The challenge of balancing ever-changing priorities is only magnified in the lives of parents raising young children.&nbsp;We wanted to take a moment to recognize the amazing parents pivoting their careers during a pandemic and graduated from a <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses">BrainStation Online Bootcamp</a>; a feat that shouldn’t go unnoticed.</p>



<p>They’ve continued to go above and beyond and have shared their experiences, with advice for fellow parents who are thinking about learning new skills and changing their careers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why Start a New Challenge?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many reasons why parents may decide to take on a bootcamp. For some, losing a job during a pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to tackle something new and earn a new career. Others saw their growing family as the spark they needed to make a career transition.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JS0d1EMh8enZ2FHOhkjNWnMQUsugGgMokakbN3bpbqqKtklwLn9xHUcdpTZGgxIxCYvEzR-bnkWN8xuhKAM1qAoycMBw0jukBPpEgM8Khw7XT1xPC5A5JHCeHgWmsacfN1ozlxMy" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development</a> graduate Jessica Kwok started the bootcamp with a background in Kinesiology and saw maternity leave as the perfect time to jump into a new career. She shared that finding remote learning was a big factor. “As a new mom, being able to do the bootcamp remotely was a major priority for me,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ultimately chose BrainStation because they were well versed in delivering content online (even before Covid!) and had an impressive growing alumni network.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elyse Renouf has a background in business consulting and recently graduated from our <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp">Data Science Bootcamp</a>. She shared that Covid-19 layoffs, daycare closures, and a desire for a more technical role that could be remote was the perfect storm to spur the need for a change and take on a course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tight and Tricky Schedules</h2>



<p>So what does studying while being a parent look like? Think packed schedules, lots of help from friends and family, and getting creative with distracting little ones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12735" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-300x258.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-768x661.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1536x1322.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-960x827.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Angus Ryer, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development </a>Graduate with a history in construction, shared his schedule:</p>



<ul><li>Wake up to my nine-month old crying</li><li>Go wake up my three-year old</li><li>Get breakfast ready, eat together, take the boys out for a walk while my wife works out</li><li>Make coffee number two</li><li>Hop online for class at 10:30 am</li><li>Listen intently and work on projects until 1 pm</li><li>Help my older boy get settled into a nap</li><li>Power through classes from 2:00 pm to 6:30 pm&nbsp;</li><li>Spend some time with my kids, eat dinner (made with love by my wife), and then settle my older one into bed</li><li>&#8220;Relax&#8221; on the couch with my wife, half-distracted by MasterChef Australia or InkMasters while I continued to study work in the concepts I had learned</li><li>Rinse and repeat!</li></ul>



<p>Other parents shared similar busy schedules, commenting that despite the lack of personal time, it was all worth it to have a brand new bootcamp credentials in only three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s scary. That&#8217;s natural. The biggest rewards usually come from the biggest risks,” said Armando Pastorin, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">UX Design Bootcamp</a> Graduate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This process is mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting for everyone,” Renouf admits. With the mix of parenting and household responsibilities while studying, it can be tempting to doubt your decision or want to quit. Luckily, her son helped provide the motivation she needed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12737" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-300x160.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-768x408.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1536x817.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-960x510.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“I did this course and am making this career change so I can get to see him more so despite how overwhelming it was at the time, I truly believe it was all worth it.”</p>



<h2>Advice for Parents Going Back to School&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Each parent was keen to share advice for other parents looking to learn remotely. Here are some of our favorite tips:</p>



<p>“Surround yourself with people who can encourage and support you along the way. As much as we&#8217;d all like to be the &#8220;super-mom&#8221; or &#8220;super-dad&#8221; who single handedly got through a bootcamp while watching your child full time, having people who can help you out and root for you is extremely valuable to your success.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<p>“Take help where needed from your family, friends or whoever you like to get some quiet time to finish your work. During my Coffee and Conversation sessions, I came across a lot of parents from different cohorts, with whom I would exchange ideas on time management and so much more which helped me a lot. &#8221; &#8211; Bonney Halani</p>



<p>“Set a schedule leading up to the program and help your kids get into that routine, so that they expect you to be focused at specific times. Kids (and grown-ups) tend to go crazy if they don&#8217;t get enough attention, so by committing to giving them the right amount of time, it&#8217;s easier to give yourself periods of focus without the kids tugging at your pant legs.” &#8211; Angus Ryer</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any sitters, no family, and at first, no daycare, and it was madness. If you can, identify where you can make your life a little smoother by either meal prepping, freezing leftovers, or ordering take out to save time. Keep snacks on your desk and relax your screen time rules (a good tablet/headphones really are your best friend in survival mode.&#8221; &#8211; Elyse Renouf</p>



<p>“Block off dedicated family time and actually stick to it.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12738" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-768x606.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-960x757.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Photo Credit: Sammie Chan (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=en">@sammiechn</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>



<p>For parents deciding to use their extra time to upskill, taking some ‘me time’ is all the more important. Pastorin did this by dedicating one evening of the week to himself. “Every Tuesday evening was my time to go out and refresh the brain with something completely unrelated to work.”<br></p>



<p>Kwok started a workout group, initiated a Zoom workout group with a few friends to keep each other accountable for a 30-minute workout, three times a week.</p>



<p>Whatever shape your ‘me time’ takes, don’t put it on the back burner! Even super parents need a break.</p>



<h2>What Comes Next</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the specific needs of a person’s demanding day-to-day are different for everyone. But these incredible parents are proof that if you are determined, committed, and perhaps a little crafty, you can achieve your goals with your family and future in mind.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Founder of Rally, Matthew Mayers, shares how his BrainStation experience bolstered his design-first entrepreneurial spirit and boosted his career in tech.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite earning a Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Matthew Mayers knew he wanted to be in the tech industry. So after a few years of side-hustles and working as an Engineer, he applied for the UX Design Diploma Program BrainStation.</p>



<p>We spoke with Mayers about his foray into tech, how the BrainStation experience bolstered his entrepreneurial spirit, and what it’s like to be a Co-Founder of <a href="http://rallylegal.com">Rally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QBmeKrma43aIW_iTtUtPkkL_2NvVDnz3yNw6dJSMvRR8VSFIWeRpBrZbOdySXc31vLk26x22C0AC6RglTFMYzulWoRzDD6qFEOwTxd6JVrTn97sjsEQvDctRCYlFz_m0O4drLV99" alt="Picture of founder, Matthew Mayers."/></figure></div>



<h2><strong>What does a typical day look like for you as a Co-Founder of Rally?</strong></h2>



<p>Every day is different and that&#8217;s why I love my job. As a Co-Founder, my responsibilities range from product design, to customer success, to accounting, to recruitment, to development. Some days are filled with meetings, others are quiet and focused. I start every day by asking myself, &#8220;What set of actions can I take today to add the most value for my company and team?&#8221; Sometimes that means weighing in on a high-stakes product discussion, other times it means running to the post office to buy stamps.</p>



<h2><strong>How did the idea for Rally first come about? What problem does it aim to solve?</strong></h2>



<p>Shortly after completing my <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">program at BrainStation</a>, I was approached by my co-founder Daniel Di Maria (a fellow BrainStation graduate) with an idea. Based on his previous experience as a lawyer, he believed that there were many opportunities to drive improvement within the legal industry. He envisioned a world in which entrepreneurs could affordably manage the legal state of their companies in a streamlined, digital fashion. Automation could be used to help their lawyers and paralegals get work done faster, more accurately, and more enjoyably.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/v40S_ioFWgO9MZfphotq3mkZEChMuDDdwVB3iUJm3JfVTap6D1JSD0pUJGYIsmPW56cl8DqIlYjXdrh8wx8HtcfA-F8Ze9xbP_X36-7gpcfWsIYOn9X89MqQxBdP5wQhuU0wegmN" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<p>Having already experienced my first shot at entrepreneurship, the idea immediately resonated as I had struggled to find affordable legal services. I ended up doing much of my legal work myself and incorrectly.</p>



<p>We soon met our other Co-Founder, Scott Stevenson, who was serendipitously developing a similar concept. Now, three years in, our ideas have grown and evolved but we still aim to solve the same problems – legal services remain too expensive, inefficient, and inaccessible.</p>



<h2><strong>What has been the response you’ve received for Rally?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Legal service providers are feeling a tremendous amount of pressure (especially in a post-COVID world) to adopt technology which enables legal work to be done better and more affordably. Purchasers of legal services are fed up with the antiquated ways of operating and are pleading with their providers to catch up with the modern, digital world. <br><br>More and more forward-thinking service providers are approaching us with a desire to provide a better client-experience and it&#8217;s highly rewarding to be equipping these drivers of positive change. We sincerely believe that this is just the beginning for the legal industry. Massive transformations will be demonstrated in the coming years and we look forward to doing our small part to help.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hrqDeEeVqEgSaOI6czqkfTA0vT6wrdnyghoE3T8btZmHsxK5sLvPc5t36R8rcbxn5a9UHm-W6hPxVcBpIl2aE9H8zq01bOCIgY6iir2AuBSqMxU0ZLs-zrrG0HeEdeOpidvgSLIO" alt="Graphic showing the interface of Rally."/></figure>



<h2><strong>What made you decide to apply to the User Experience Diploma Program?</strong></h2>



<p>I have always been deeply fascinated by the intersection of human behavior and technology. User experience design is so much more than the selection of fonts and colours. Digital design has the power to alter how people see themselves, interact with each other, and engage with the world around them. Through BrainStation, I aimed to achieve a deeper understanding of how to harness this power. I wanted to develop both my creativity and technical acumen to improve people&#8217;s lives through innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How did the skills you learned at BrainStation contribute to how you designed your product?</strong></h2>



<p>At BrainStation, I learned how to take a step back and ask the right questions before starting to build. Who are we building for? What are their biggest pain-points? Where are the greatest opportunities to improve people&#8217;s workflows? What do they want, not just from products but from their lives? What do they need?</p>



<p>We spent several months speaking with potential customers, asking these questions and iterating on mockups before writing a single line of code. We have since developed a design-first culture and answering the &#8216;why&#8217; always comes before the &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;how.&#8217; We&#8217;re proud that even our talented development team is involved in the process from the very early stages of design to help ensure we&#8217;re building the right tools for our customers.</p>



<h2><strong>What challenges have you faced in creating a seamless user experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most challenging aspects of designing Rally is accounting for multiple, distinct user types, each with their own unique goals and behavior. While our customers are legal service providers, they use Rally as their client-facing interface. It&#8217;s a two-sided product – similar to a marketplace with buyers and sellers. Accommodating the various “jobs-to-be-done” of each persona while providing a frictionless, unified experience necessitates working relentlessly with our customers and their clients to continuously gather insights. <br><br>Every Designer learns about the value of customer feedback but sorting, filtering, and prioritizing insights is a highly nuanced and ever-evolving process.</p>



<h2><strong>What was a highlight of your BrainStation learning experience?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While learning the core executional skills of UX Design was one of the best educational experiences of my life, I particularly enjoyed the group discussions focused on the philosophy and ethics of design. Thanks to my instructors, Alex Chong and Brad MacDonald, there were many opportunities to dive into the rich, existential questions of what it means to design. These conversations forever changed my understanding of how the application of science through technology impacts humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_U60H4P8p6Y9Gj-CfoFxbMwMtfUoutUUXwzI27cjaNDTHGqEtWzhbH8A1ufmZR8vDTtTH6qZkdKbZ-XVImw4SawX6-yqJ5EcnjHEuIC-8NMEhmoS23FBchrCFLGNquQNrMgiLvha" alt="Group of young students gathered around a computer in class."/></figure>



<h2><strong>You hired Tiffany Chan, a fellow BrainStation graduate. How did you connect?</strong></h2>



<p>We did! We recently had the opportunity to recruit for an entry-level position and couldn&#8217;t think of a better place to look than the bootcamp ecosystem. We got in touch with Michael Bennett, BrainStation&#8217;s Career Success Manager, who connected us with Tiffany. With her experience both as a student in the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development program</a> and then as a TA, she was able to hit the ground running at Rally from her first day. Our team is now almost half BrainStation graduates!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What would you say are some essential digital skills needed to succeed in business?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The single most essential digital skill I would suggest for anyone in the tech industry is developing a foundational understanding of how code works. You don&#8217;t need to become a certified Software Engineer or even gain true proficiency – but you will have a massive advantage knowing a bit about what&#8217;s under the hood to confidently assess feasibility and effort requirements for new functionality. This applies to Designers, Marketers, Product Managers – everyone. Learning the basics of code has made me a much more effective team member even though most of my job doesn&#8217;t require any coding at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What advice would you give to aspiring UX Designers?</strong></h2>



<p>Designing for an idealistic world with rigid processes will only get you so far. In the real world there are technological constraints, market sizing concerns, budgets, and timelines that all need to be considered. Learning to understand everyone else&#8217;s role within a team (such as marketing, finance, development, etc.) and their requirements is as important as designing for the end-user. This is how you move beyond pipe dreams and toward product designs that actually get built and used in real life. By gaining a sense of the big picture and approaching your process with an appropriate level of flexibility, you will find yourself integrating business and technical requirements into your designs at earlier stages.&nbsp;<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This month, current BrainStation students had the opportunity to participate in a Design Sprint, in partnership with IBM.</p>



<p>Each team had five days to design a solution for an identified problem inspired by one of three sample user personas. IBM&#8217;s Senior Design Lead David Burdreau and Senior UX Designer Dan Silveira judged the event, and were impressed by what they saw from the student teams. “You guys are blowing me away… it’s absolutely incredible what you can accomplish in five days. It makes me think that we at IBM should do more in five-day sprints,” Burdreau said.</p>

<p>We spoke with the winning team: Hope Liang, Jose-Carlos (Joey) Laguio, Matthew Ahn, Nina Paramonov, Rachel Fuhrer, and Renee Yang. Together, these students designed Task Circle, a remote collaboration app to help improve inclusive interactions between international students and their project teammates.</p>



<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>Currently enrolled in the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">full-time User Experience Design bootcamp</a> at BrainStation, the students were eager to put their learnings to the test and work with a larger team of Designers with a panel from a design thinking pioneer like IBM.</p>



<p>“The main benefit of participating in the design sprint was having the opportunity to work within a larger group of Designers. In class, we typically worked with around two or three other Designers at a time, but in this case, we had the opportunity of working within a team of six,” said Laguio.</p>



<p>“It was an opportunity to solve big problems in a very short amount of time. It challenged me and gave me a chance to think deeply about important issues,” said Fuhrer.</p>



<p>For their winning project, the team was inspired by the pivot many post-secondary students have had to make while pursuing remote education from all over the world.</p>



<p>“We came up with Task Circle, a digital solution to address the online learning and student collaboration that was designed with international students in mind. We wanted to create something that allowed students to feel valued and included by their peers in order for them to effectively contribute to projects,” said Yang.</p>



<p>Task Circle:</p>



<ol><li>Allows students to communicate and empathize with their classmates</li><li>Tracks project progress, successes, and challenges</li><li>Supports inclusion by creating space for international students to reach out for help</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-1024x336.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12250" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-1024x336.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-300x98.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-768x252.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-1536x504.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3-960x315.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25171956/image2-3.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Working Together While Apart</h2>



<p>While trying to solve remote collaboration for other students, the team first had to figure out how they were going to master it for themselves.</p>



<p>“One of the reasons why I think our group worked so well together was because every single one of us did a fantastic job of accommodating each others’ schedules,” said Laguio. With students collaborating from around the world, time zones were another factor to consider in their design process.</p>



<p>Paramonov credits the outstanding professionalism of her teammates for their success. “It was a mix of very humble, curious and hardworking people. All of us put the team interest before personal interests. All decision-making we made together based on logic, time frame and learned material.”</p>



<p>But the design sprint wasn’t without challenges.</p>



<p>Delivering a high-fidelity prototype in just five days to be presented to design leaders from IBM is no small feat.</p>



<p>“We were posed with a daunting challenge and it was difficult figuring out how to get started. We had lots of questions, confusion about what to focus on and lots of uncertainty in general. I learned that getting started, making assumptions, and asking questions is the hardest, but most important part,” said Fuhrer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking">Design thinking</a> requires conducting user research to test assumptions and learn more about user needs. When the team’s initial assumptions and hypothesis didn’t align with what they uncovered through their research, they had to reevaluate their project’s purpose.</p>



<p>“It was a chance for us to pivot from our original idea, we had to kind of let go of our attachment to previous plans, but we all had an understanding that we needed to focus on what would bring the best solution,” said Yang.</p>



<p>Communication around what would bring the best solution and keep the project moving forward also proved to be a bit of a challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much like design teams in the workplace, communication proved to be essential. As the team of six ideated, different opinions and visions emerged, but this did not stall the project&#8217;s progress.</p>



<p>“Even if we didn’t fully agree, it didn’t mean the conversation had to stop,” said Laguio. “We created a space where it was okay to respectfully challenge others’ ideas, and where it was even better to riff off of them to spur even more creative ideas.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-1024x591.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12252" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-1024x591.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-300x173.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-768x443.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-1536x887.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1-960x554.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/25172111/image3-1.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When presentation day arrived, Liang recalls the excitement her team felt as they prepared. “All team members were helping each other to practice their speech, time the parts, adjust the [slide] deck, and do whatever it takes to make the final pitch flawless.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s always a desire to push further and if you had more time you feel as if you could do more, do better. It’s important to manage expectations,” notes Ahn.“It was satisfying to see our presentation come together. To see all of our hard work come together in the end, we felt proud of each other.”</p>



<h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>



<p>Fuhrer credits BrainStation’s extensive curriculum with her ability to tackle the sprint, “The 12-week bootcamp is taught by passionate educators that come from different industry backgrounds and experiences. They have taught me so much&#8230; design concepts, skills, career guidance, and I’ve been supported from day one to fully launch myself into a UX career,” she said, adding that the program also gave her hands-on experience with essential design tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I went from never touching design software prior to BrainStation, to presenting our project in week seven with ease and confidence,”&nbsp; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team encourages those considering a career change to take their first step into the unknown. “Embrace ambiguity. Accept that you might not know where that next step might take you, and that this is okay.” said Laguio. “I took the leap and threw myself into [BrainStation’s] intensive UX Design bootcamp. And now, it’s really surreal thinking about how we’ve just won our first design sprint with IBM and comparing that to the fear-filled me from a few months ago!”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AwUVds6FPTUUWTSQaOl6k8GIXxpbEZOtVlBqkL8VZnl08n-Lmb1mv0y1PkB0KcJb8K86RdhZSMKsgVXBW0U-BrQ6U80BXbW_LhunT5dFTBJ21DgPcy-AO-r5qHoEBxRt5qiL9VEV" alt="" width="260" height="389"/></figure></div>



<p>Chiantelle Nicole is a Registered Holistic Nutritionist, a Certified Wedding Planner, and the founder of Chia’s Eats, a nutrition community and consulting service. After a medical scare in 2011, Nicole sought alternatives to the laundry list of medications she was prescribed. Her health journey led her to start her career as a Nutritionist and consultant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A big part of me wanted to try an alternative, and that’s when I turned to food. I love food already (I call myself a professional taste tester) and so I wanted to learn more about how to use it therapeutically.”</p>



<p>As Nicole looked to grow her business, she quickly understood that social media marketing is a big piece in establishing a brand and building a community. We spoke with Nicole to learn how she’s used social media to grow her brand presence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Building Community </h2>



<p>Nicole took BrainStation’s Social Media Marketing course to find new ways to meet potential clients, community members, and partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Social media is such a powerful tool and a great way to build a community all over the world. I actually met a lot of people through social media before meeting them in person. Even though I had a good foundation of how to utilize social media personally and professionally, I wanted to dig deeper to learn more about optimizing it especially because there’s always something new to learn.”</p>



<p>Nicole relies on channels like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest to display her food and event content, and the Social Media Marketing course showed her the benefit of truly understanding your audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Once you have that foundation, the application of a social media strategy and successful campaigns becomes so much easier,” she shared. “This course also reminded me of how important and powerful language and visuals can become, especially when you’re wanting to convert strangers to followers to clients in actually purchasing your product or service.”</p>



<h2>A Strong Brand Presence</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jgcWSabHqtcCUHE4HfstLaWCWnQctMA6x_CPbbFCKBxzJsVcZBbMcUl6XFUO3okOcPLv7TfBGr7w1MCOiE0qXpco2NTp_8so7qLxGjhXerhurC1Vv1EflyKzq3upLilARSqrg9QT" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A big part of developing your social media and online presence is to have a recognizable brand aesthetic. For Nicole, that meant a classic, clean look that focused on storytelling and learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When people go to Chia’s Eats, I want them to feel happy, excited, and eager to know more about food and nutrition. I want people to know where their food is coming from and make them feel inspired to try new things.”</p>



<p>The more she learns, the more her strategy has adapted to master the social channels that work best for her brand.</p>



<p>“Since taking the course, my marketing strategy has changed to focus more on specializing in one-to-two specific platforms at a time rather than constantly creating content everywhere. It can get super overwhelming especially with all the new features, and by doing this, it has allowed me to build a stronger community and generate good quality leads.”</p>



<p>After implementing some of the strategy she learned, Nicole shared that she’s increased her following on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chiaseats/?hl=en">@chiaseats</a> by 85 percent, her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chiantelle/?hl=en">personal following</a> by 95.5 percent, and her <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/chiantellenicole/">Pinterest</a> views by 48.2 percent!</p>



<p>For Nicole, the biggest challenge was deciding on a specific direction that would set her apart from the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Learning how I could stand out and bring in my own offering was a challenge. However, the relationships and connections I made have really helped, and I would say that is key to my successes in marketing my brand. Second would be having a clear marketing plan and an ideal audience to speak to. Understanding what I was offering and investing in relationships &#8230; made a huge difference.”</p>



<p>Her advice to fellow entrepreneurs? Take it one step at a time. “It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the avenues and all the features,” she said, “but try them out anyway to see what works best for you, your services, and your audience. Ask for help and keep investing in you.”</p>



<h2>A Foundation of Learning&nbsp;</h2>



<p>BrainStation’s Social Media course was a great way for Nicole to dive into social media on a deeper level and apply new concepts to her marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The highlight from my BrainStation learning experience would be in the real life examples from our instructor, Julie. It’s one thing to learn concepts and foundations, and it’s a whole other level applying it to something more tangible,” she said, adding that she expects to keep learning –&nbsp;life-long learning, after all, is at the heart of her business venture.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/fj8hjI34QelQ4G160UFsyCL6IfcnegIzNEL6rs2hRLdxhot1bm_2BNcEtQQxznffP3cBuyDWaMcF0tAAXWDzqPs9gX52-Qm_4UMBhw9OEzlsjQLvIOeF2EBlo5Tdjnl6QtFmUTai" alt="" width="347" height="521"/></figure></div>



<p>“Chia’s Eats is more than just sharing what I eat. It’s an online platform that focuses on community, education, and fun. I utilize this platform to share more about supporting local businesses, easy and healthy recipes, nutritional information, what’s in season in farmer’s markets, sustainability, and tips on how to live a more intentional and holistic lifestyle.”</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ec-NPNPh0lQFO4-DL5jprzjZtRB0syEeOUkRb5DP8rZhz1OiiQY656Oa_goeu4AZvxL-ZXd9zm3rVRFXzvTPGh0imAnMmuOaFGznUqBpqivWKFrOSz6FTMAzXSLzEk4UQevlfnOy" alt="" width="240" height="360"/></figure></div>



<p>In 2016, Mathieu Bellemare had an idea for an app; he just didn’t know how to design it. That initial desire to bring his ideas to life led him to BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">UX Design bootcamp</a>, and ultimately towards a career in Product Design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Design, however, isn’t all that Bellemare does; he’s also the Co-Founder of Yohomo, Toronto’s leading site for the artistic Queer community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://yohomo.ca/">Yohomo</a> works to bring Toronto’s LGBTQ2+ communities together by highlighting parties, events, plays, screenings, marches, and exclusive Spotify playlists. They also host a seasonal gay bash for everyone to come together and celebrate.</p>



<p>We spoke with Bellemare about Yohomo and how his success in UX and Product design helped him build a career and passion project.</p>



<h2>Creating a Community Around Music and Dance</h2>



<p>Bellemare&#8217;s Co-Founders Armand Digdoyo and Phil Villeneuve once worked as&nbsp;DJs, and they were often asked about other events to attend in the nightlife scene.</p>



<p>“People have been isolated by social media bubbles and it’s hard to discover certain events if you don’t already have an &#8216;in&#8217;. So, we decided to create a website that would make it possible for anyone to find events in Toronto through a simple Google search,” Bellemare said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more events they shared, the wider their audience grew, and with Toronto queer magazines in short supply since the shuttering of publications like FAB or the end of the print edition of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/xtra-gay-newspaper-in-toronto-ottawa-and-vancouver-announces-end-of-print-1.2900981"><em>Xtra</em></a><em>,</em> Yohomo quickly filled a void.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dmcNBOjTRqt3JISRFMh6TS7JAsiUyPTjqEeEEsc0t2fZgTlejM9SXARf_q1n1iW3hKBtR8cYLWGMMFF86VgdK0_U3Tms8SvVfAPb8NTZdVn2Qdx31rJx9Yd0s66HbBlp0BoKxHaC" alt="Group of six people posing for a picture at a queer event showing off their Drag, wigs, and pink leopard print and more. "/></figure>



<p>“What started with just a couple of friends browsing for events, grew into a full blog, collaborations with visual artists for merch, fundraisers, in-person events, etc.” The trio now work with a team of collaborators, including Writers, DJs, Graphic Artists, Performers, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A unique component to the Yohomo community is their exclusive music playlists and partnership with Spotify. “We had an opportunity to partner up with Spotify in our second year and that started a full <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6TGtQBvSPVtbyvdpTbtmW1?si=Q6EHbEUDTZGwhnVjVew_CA">Spotify channel</a> in which we highlight queer talent and the songs we love,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My job is mostly to manage the musical voice of our playlists as well as communicating with new artists [&#8230;] and finding a way to showcase their talent!”</p>



<h2>Building Design Systems</h2>



<p>When Bellemare isn’t working on finding the next best musical talent, his day is filled with conversations about systematic design as a Product Designer at Apply Digital.</p>



<p>“I would say most of my work is around creating solid design systems with a focus on inclusion and accessibility. I consult and help on a lot of projects in regards to digital accessibility, which tends to be overlooked in the industry,” Bellmare shared.</p>



<p>“The truth is, people need a lot of convincing in order to realize the importance of accessibility, and it just so happens that I love to convince people!”</p>



<h2>Creating an Inclusive Tech Space&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We asked Bellemare what the tech community should do to be more inclusive of the Queer community, but understandably, he remarks that it’s a loaded question and a lot of action is required.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aaf_Yo1UtYd8VZpp9C1KTsVe_YMW5DQ096qgy5RMYcMPKKk2hTV__PI4Y_IZCDjPzdnVgwMyT3pqr8DYChisqp7dRedaWIHn4C4PacQtmnskWAQjGviACOPuSy0pcaKy4EkyH3R_" alt="The Yohomo Team: Armand Digdoyo, Phil Villeneuve, and Mathieu Bellemare" width="481" height="445"/></figure></div>



<p>“I think more than ever the effort needs to be on the intersectionality of the Queer community. It&#8217;s important we work on removing the classist barrier that exists currently in technology at all levels, but mostly at the founder and C-suite level,” he shares.</p>



<p>“Diverse leaders get you diverse teams, diverse ideas and companies only profit from including inclusive practices that are simply more representative of the audience.”</p>



<h2>Building a Design Skill Set&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Bellemare was a singer before joining the tech scene, so when it came to design, he had to start from the basics. He shares the high-intensity environment at BrainStation was exactly what he needed to learn quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than anything he says, BrainStation helped him understand how to learn and learn enough to eventually launch his own journey into design. He notes that BrainStation’s project-based learning encourages students to be “a bit crazier, louder, and riskier about [their] ideas, since there was no fear of expectations. This attitude still carries me to this day to take risks in everything I do and push the envelope.”</p>



<p>After his experience, Bellemare has fond memories of his time at BrainStation. “I still have a couple of good friends from that experience, both students and teachers, and they are always there to back me up or give me the tips on what is happening in the industry.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked what Bellemare was most proud of at Yohomo, he just laughed.</p>



<p>“Of course this is too hard to respond to!” He said. “The latest thing we do is always our proudest. We are four years old, so still have a lot of objectives to fill and we do that by doing a little something new every month!”</p>



<p>So, then what’s next?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can&#8217;t reveal too much yet! But, lots of new content, videos, a possible expansion across Canada and hopefully a return of our quarterly parties when possible. We love to get together with our crowd, especially when it involves outdoors, blazing sun, and stupid bubbly fruity drinks!”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This last month, graduates had the opportunity to participate in our first stay-at-home hackathon (in partnership with Microsoft).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each team had three days to design a solution for a better work-from-home experience that could integrate with the Microsoft Teams video chat software. After a few intense days of work and collaboration, the judges were seriously impressed with the results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We spoke with the winning team: Pablo Lopez Castillo (UX Design), Jung Oh (UX Design), Ali Eddeb (Data Science), and Nick Mahon (Data Science). Together, the alumni designed FocusBuddy, a productivity app to help you stay focused on your tasks.</p>



<h2>The Challenge</h2>



<p>Having recently completed their full-time diploma programs at BrainStation, the graduates were eager to test their new skills with a challenge from a tech giant like Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By participating in this hackathon, my hope was that I would be exposed to the types of challenges or projects Microsoft employees get to tackle, as well as how they solve them,” Oh said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For their project, the winning team wanted to reflect the current conditions professionals face when working from home. “We found that productivity was a primary issue remote workers face due to a variety of reasons. One of the most prominent pain points users had with productivity was that they had trouble maintaining self-discipline when attempting to thwart distractions (such as a cell phone),” the team explained.</p>



<p>The team decided to focus on developing a Microsoft Teams add-on called FocusBuddy, which helps boost remote productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FocusBuddy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Identifies user work habits and suggests on how to improve them with computer vision</li><li>Sends reminders and recommendations throughout a session to increase productivity and wellness&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Awards points for uninterrupted work and healthy habits</li><li>&nbsp;Allows daily team goal-setting with leader boards and results&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>Working Together</h2>



<p>Working remotely, the team used a plethora of tools to iterate, create, collaborate, and test. The Designers relied on Sketch, Figma, and Invision, while the Data Scientists used Sublime Text 3, Anaconda Prompt, and Jupyter Notebooks. Of course, Microsoft Teams also supported communication and collaboration to keep them working together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Seeing our concept come to life within the time constraints was satisfying as we all had pivotal roles,” Castillo said, explaining that there were many proud moments amongst the team.&nbsp;As a bonus, the team created a product <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFr-fAFbb8u6iAJivQWQgxv3bm4342Wk/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">commercial</a> which really tied the whole presentation together. </p>



<p>Eddeb for one was impressed by the team dynamics. “We were able to criticize our ideas well and did not fall into groupthink. We were able to delegate tasks effectively and we overall had a good time working together.”</p>



<p>Similarly, Oh enjoyed working with Data Scientists to leverage unique solutions. “We were able to ask our Data Scientists to provide thought-provoking perspectives, educate ourselves regarding the possibilities of data, and implement innovative solutions as a result.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mahon, meanwhile, was pleased with the way the UX team brought their ideas into reality. “Bringing such a polished look to an otherwise rough idea was incredible.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-1024x536.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-11938" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-1024x536.jpeg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-300x157.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-768x402.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack-960x502.jpeg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15131640/microsofthack.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But it wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting the project, in particular, posed a challenge. “There were just so many ways to approach the improvement of the work-from-home experience,” the team said. “We spent a significant amount of time redefining our problem space to achieve what we felt to be the best solution.”</p>



<p>As they moved forward, the team relied on what they learned at BrainStation to find success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From the plethora of knowledge gained in completing the Data Science program at BrainStation, the most relevant of it was learned during 3D day,” Mahon said. BrainStation 3D is a day in which students from the UX, Data, and Web Dev platforms come together for a day-long collaborative competition to practice working cross-functionally. “Working with UX Designers beforehand and having an idea of how our work complements one another went a long way in arriving at our final product,” said Mahon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The others agreed that BrainStation gave them the tools to work well as a multidisciplinary group. Plablo shared that the program taught him skills that helped him with “navigating the problem space and understanding how to extract insights and translating research to identify user needs is a skill I am always working to improve on.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh agreed that the diploma program taught them how to approach problems in a team setting. “This skill was useful in the hackathon because it enabled our team to get all of our ideas on the table, use our individual strengths and knowledge to analyze and select an idea to move work with, and apply the technical skills we have been trained in.”</p>



<h2>Taking the Next Step</h2>



<p>The team encourages other recent graduates and others seeking a role in UX or Data to practice, practice, practice. Edebb says the best advice he’s received is to continue working on projects. “Once you have foundational knowledge, try to implement what you have learned by working on projects.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, Mahon reminds us:<em> </em>“The slogan that is heard throughout our time at BrainStation is based on being ‘a lifetime learner.’ My advice is to do exactly that; there is never nothing new to learn and the more you know, the more directions you will be able to take your career.”<br></p>

<p>&#8220;There were so many resources that were given to us from the Education team in terms of portfolio reviews, advice, resume workshops that really prepared me to have that confidence going into interviews.

				<description><![CDATA[<p>Meet Summer Effray, a Communications Consultant turned Innovation Consultant who advanced her career with BrainStation's Online Live UX Design course.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer Effray is a Digital Communications professional turned Innovation Consultant, who discovered her love for the design thinking process and a user-centric approach when taking BrainStation’s <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online Live User Experience (UX) Design</a> Certificate Course. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_9442" style="width: 251px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9442" class="wp-image-9442" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06.jpg" alt="UX Design Student" width="241" height="388" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06.jpg 1030w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06-186x300.jpg 186w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Summer-Effray-2019-06-636x1024.jpg 636w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9442" class="wp-caption-text">Summer Effray</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living and working in Kelowna, B.C., Summer wanted access to digital skills training but couldn’t make it to a physical campus location. We spoke with Summer about her experience learning in an Online Live classroom, and how she’s bringing the UX skills she gained throughout the course into her role as Innovation Consultant for the City of Kelowna.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us a bit about your education and career background?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straight out of high school, I went to university and successfully completed a Bachelor of Arts with an English major from the University of Victoria (UVic). My first job after university was an administrative assistant with a financial investment firm in Kelowna, BC. After three and a half years there, I knew that administrative work, particularly in finance, wasn’t for me, so I found a new job at a local real estate development company as a development coordinator and then a marketing coordinator. During my short foray into marketing, I realized I was heading in a career direction that better fit my skills and interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pretty much brings me to my career with the City of Kelowna, which has spanned more than a decade. During my career in Communications, I took distance education through UVic to get my Public Relations Diploma, became a full-time permanent employee, was promoted several times to be one of the department’s senior Communicators, became a certified Communication Management Professional and served as a judge for the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) Gold Quill Awards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, I was in the Digital Communications portfolio, managing the City’s digital channels and strategy, which is what lead me to take the UX course from BrainStation. </span></p>
<p><b>Was the UX Design course helpful when moving into your new role?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UX course has served me well and was definitely an asset when I applied to my current position as an Innovation Consultant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that my commitment to continuous learning was one of the reasons that I got my current job. Working with the Intelligent Cities Manager, my job is to support smart city strategies and initiatives, help drive improvements to City service delivery, and foster a collaborative, data-driven and customer-centric culture.</span></p>
<p><b>What was your motivation behind taking the Online Live UX Design Course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to take the UX Design course because it looked like something that would help me in my job at the time as a Communications Consultant – managing websites and advising on digital channel development. It also seemed like a good way to spend some time exploring another potential career path, and I’ve always been interested in design. </span></p>
<p><b>What factors influenced your decision to take Online Live Learning rather than in-person?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I live in Kelowna and there is no BrainStation location here, and I work full-time, the online format was appealing and, honestly, necessary for me to be able to take the course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also received a <a href="https://brainstation.io/scholarships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainStation scholarship</a> and financial support from the City of Kelowna, which – along with the leeway to leave work a bit early on classroom days – enabled me to take the UX course. I am so thankful to have been given the support and flexibility that I needed to continue my education.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><b>What were some of the most valuable skills you gained during the UX course? Have these skills aided your professional development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about design thinking; being user-centric; and the iterative process of sketching, wireframing, and prototyping. In my previous role, the course helped me to better advise web content providers about best practices, as well as begin the development of a set of online experience standards to help guide the expansion of the City’s digital channels – all while staying focused on the user experience and providing good customer service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Innovation Consultant, I have helped to bring service design thinking and processes to the City, and having some existing knowledge of design and user experience was pivotal in my ability to become a champion for this new (for Kelowna) way of doing things.</span></p>
<p><b>As an Innovation Consultant for the City of Kelowna, what does a typical day look like for you?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day is different, but they usually start with some time spent reading about innovation and smart city initiatives and trends around the world. I might also have a meeting with my supervisor – the Intelligent Cities Manager – to regroup on what we are working on and coordinate any follow up that might be required relating to current projects or touchpoints with partners. A bit of each day is devoted to sharing what I’m working on with coworkers and probing to see if there are opportunities for collaboration with other staff or partners in the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project work usually ends up being part of my day as well – we’re investigating the feasibility of a number of other initiatives including bringing AI to the City in the form of a website chatbot to help improve customer service and reduce the demand on staff resources to deal with simple, routine questions. I’m also developing and implementing a strategic communications plan to keep stakeholders updated on the Intelligent City Strategy and initiatives, as well as opportunities to work with us. </span></p>
<p><b>Have you been able to incorporate the skills you learned in the UX Design course into your role?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, I’m currently working on creating resources for staff to help them adopt service design thinking and become more user-centric when improving or creating new services. Plus I’m involved in two major online service improvement projects that use service design thinking, UX design principles, and agile development methodologies.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you describe the Online Live learning experience? What was the highlight?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Online Live experience was different than other distance education courses that I’ve taken, because it actually felt like you were part of a class. This format was awesome because you’d start out learning about something through theory and then you would get a chance to practice with a real life example or application. I think this really solidifies things for a learner – it did for me anyway. The opportunities to break out into smaller groups during class was also great. Even though the classes were three hours long, they went by pretty fast because they were so engaging.</span></p>

<h3><b>How did you break into the fashion industry? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I launched </span><a href="https://corduroiclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corduroi club</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015, the concept of the brand is to focus on excellence. My goal for the company is to create quality products in limited quantities. I grew up with many talented, creative friends, and I hope to create a collaborative platform that constantly goes back and forth between new ideas and products. Over the past few years of running corduroi club, I have been fortunate to meet many like-minded creatives, artists, photographers, and brand owners from all over the globe that I would’ve never met otherwise. It opened up many doors for me when I decided to take the risk, put out my idea, and watch it grow little by little. </span></p>
<h3><b>How did you discover the demand for affordable, high-quality T-shirts? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, I was searching for quality T-shirts for myself. After researching and talking with people, I realized there is a potential market for mid-range quality T-shirts in North America. It really started off with a passion to find something that I love, which eventually led to researching production, finding a manufacturer, and next thing I know, I am setting up a business meeting and starting a clothing brand!  </span></p>
<h3><b>What inspired your branding and aesthetic? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">corduroi club’s aesthetic is really just a natural expression of my upbringing. It is a collage of all the things I’ve immersed myself in over the years: growing up in Hong Kong and Vancouver; reading Japanese magazines from early 2000s; studying jazz music in university &#8212; and placing all of those elements together into one project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized a lot of my inspiration comes from my fascination for street culture and design. You look at cities like Tokyo, Vancouver, and New York for example, how each of those cities have a certain atmosphere and feeling: the way people talk, the architecture, the sounds. All of these unique cultural expressions are what inspires me when I think in terms of branding and identity. With corduroi club, I hope to use these white T-shirts as a blank canvas to unravel the personality and individuality of each person wearing these simple quality garments. It’s an idea I am always thinking about and experimenting with: to create products that users can wear in their own style and expression. </span></p>

<h3><strong>At one point, you opened a temporary storefront for your T-Shirts. Why did you think it was important to have a Pop-up store? </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, thankfully my friends own a design studio and storefront in Kitsilano called SORT. I think it is always important to showcase the products in a physical space and allow customers to experience the products in person. I love meeting customers and interacting with them; I think it is a good way for me to receive feedback on how customers feel about the brand and how it is received. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a startup brand, I think it is special for me to discover who the early customers are and to be able to connect with them directly as friends. Their support is what encourages me to keep going and it has been a rewarding experience to see the brand and the customer base grow over the years. </span></p>

<h3>What made you decide to take a UX Certificate Course?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last year or so, I became very interested in the tech industry because a lot of my friends are programmers and designers. I realized the importance of UX design as a universal skill and how it aligns with the things that I do: designing business solutions (products) that ultimately help people solve problems and improve their daily experiences. </span></p>
<h3><b>What are some key lessons you learned from BrainStation that helped you design your brand and product? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the important skills I learned from the program are design thinking, user empathy, and understanding the importance of user-centric designs. Design thinking was a big one for me. When studying music, I was trained to practice and practice until I could play the drums better and faster, kind of like exercising and building muscles. But, it never really taught me to ask why, or how I should approach a problem when I am stuck. Starting a business can be really tough when everything begins with a trial and error process. I learned a lot from my mistakes and if I had learned about design thinking earlier on, it would’ve helped me strategize and plan ahead to create more optimal business decisions that would have saved time and money.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-10685 alignright" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-819x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600-960x1200.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/R0003600.jpg 1855w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>What do you do to stay creative in your spare time? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my spare time, I usually read design articles on tech websites to keep up with the industry. I also love to research vintage clothing, watch skateboard videos, and read about Bauhaus designers and their approach.</span></p>
<h3><b>The UX Course teaches students to use a User Journey Map to organize ideas and plot research. How did you adapt this method from your UX training into planning your retail products? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key insights I discovered through my </span><a href="https://www.jameschoi.design/corduroiclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Journey Map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was understanding to address the moments when customers experience doubts during the shopping experience. Often, they are doubtful when they are unsure about their size, which is a common problem for online shopping. I try to alleviate those doubts by providing measurements of the shirts and reference photos on social media to show how the product fits on different body types. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10670 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-1024x594.png" alt="user journey map showing customer pain points" width="1024" height="594" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-1024x594.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-300x174.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-768x445.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM-960x556.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-02-at-3.05.15-PM.png 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Do you think you’ll expand beyond the T-shirt space in the future? If so, will you follow the same process? </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely, I still see corduroi club at it’s beginning stage and there are still so many projects I want to explore in the future. I am so glad and thankful for the strong support from customers all over the world. They really encourage me to move forward and continue to expand the label. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember one time my friend took a photo of a guy wearing a corduroi club tote bag at a concert in Tokyo, it was an incredible moment for me! I think the process is always refining and I am always learning new information about design and growing a business. I am always trying new things and I am excited to apply the things I have learned from BrainStation to grow the brand as well as my UX career in the tech industry. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demo Day is this December 4th and leading up to our student project showcase, we’ve taken a closer look at Revive, one of our top graduate design projects. Karina Bershteyn, now a Designer at GrowerIQ, designed the app, which lets users find environmental volunteering opportunities, as part of the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Design Diploma Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;in just 12 weeks!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0N5A2500-e1574782529193.jpg"><img class="wp-image-10116 size-medium alignright" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0N5A2500-e1574782529193-300x242.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="242" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0N5A2500-e1574782529193-300x242.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/0N5A2500-e1574782529193-768x621.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bershteyn wanted her final program project to address the current climate crisis. So she posed the question: “How might we help urban millennials take environmental action?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s pretty clear that people are concerned and want to make changes and take action to clean up their acts. The idea for this app was to help make that connection between someone wanting to get involved with local environmental clean-up initiatives, and actually taking the step to get involved.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c8fb8c7b10f2554dbea92a9/t/5c9933c8f4e1fc03f702e6af/1553544145369/CapstonePDF1+2_compressed.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">user research interviews,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bershteyn found that her target audience was keen to get involved with environmental clean-up events, but “they didn’t know where to look or even find out about any events that are happening in their area.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.karinabdesign.com/revive-app"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solves this problem by connecting young people with organizations offering volunteer opportunities, making it a lot easier to find ways to take action. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.19.34-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10117" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.19.34-AM.png" alt="" width="400" height="341" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.19.34-AM.png 1016w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.19.34-AM-300x256.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.19.34-AM-768x655.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.19.34-AM-960x818.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revive makes it possible to learn about nearby events, sign up for those events, and even invite friends to join them. “By building a community within the app, it would further motivate and encourage [users] to get involved in something they feel good about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After developing user insights, Bershteyn got to work developing an experience map and wireframes. She found success in her first round of user testing, “in both rounds of testing, users were able to easily complete each task.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-25-at-10.48.42-AM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-10118 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-25-at-10.48.42-AM.png" alt="" width="747" height="667" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-25-at-10.48.42-AM.png 747w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-25-at-10.48.42-AM-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step? Building a visual identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her portfolio explains that the selected heavy use of images would resonate well with her target audience and evoke a sense of emotion in the user. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.20.36-AM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-10119 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.20.36-AM.png" alt="" width="537" height="395" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.20.36-AM.png 537w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-15-at-10.20.36-AM-300x221.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></a></p>
