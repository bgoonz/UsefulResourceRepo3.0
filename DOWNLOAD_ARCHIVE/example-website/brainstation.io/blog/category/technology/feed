<p><em>Global leader in digital skills training enters agreement to acquire South Florida’s leading coding and UX design bootcamp, further expanding its reach and offerings.</em></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK, NY</strong> &#8212; BrainStation, the global leader in digital skills training, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire <a href="https://wyncode.co/">Wyncode</a>, Florida’s leading coding and user experience (UX) design bootcamp. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>



<p>With the acquisition, BrainStation takes on a leadership position in the Florida digital skills training market, offering a suite of full-time bootcamps including Web Development, UX Design, Data Science, and Digital Marketing.</p>



<p>“Acquiring Wyncode is a strong and strategic step to expanding the BrainStation business, and will accelerate our mission to reshape the future of digital skills training across the country,” said Jason Field, Founder and CEO of BrainStation. “Wyncode has been an integral part of Miami’s fast-growing tech industry and Wyncode’s founders and leaders have built deep relationships in the community.”</p>



<p>Founded in 2014 by Johanna and Juha Mikkola, Wyncode Academy has graduated nearly 1,000 students while establishing itself as the premier provider of digital skills training in Florida. It was the first coding bootcamp to be licensed by the Florida Department of Education’s Commission for Independent Education and has won numerous industry awards.</p>



<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to become part of BrainStation’s global mission,” said Wyncode’s CEO Johanna Mikkola, who will join BrainStation. “Seven years ago, we set out to solve Miami’s tech talent gap and reinvent how digital skills were learned in the Miami community. Becoming a part of BrainStation is a transformational next step. It will allow us to have a greater impact and reach more learners than ever before as well as support the community through job creation and tech talent development,” Mikkola said.</p>



<p>Miami’s tech industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with South Florida becoming a new hub for the digital economy. Demand for digital skills is greater than the supply of qualified employees, and that skills gap is growing. The World Economic Forum estimates that more than half of all employees will require significant reskilling by 2022, with emerging technologies generating 133 million new jobs.</p>



<p>“BrainStation’s expansion into Miami underscores the tremendous progress our city has made as a global tech hub. The quality of tech talent and the caliber of employers in South Florida are both on the rise, and we are thrilled to see BrainStation’s investment in our region and community in order to build on the foundation Wyncode has created here,” said Francis Suarez, Mayor of Miami.</p>

<p>BrainStation was advised by Duane Morris and Wyncode was advised by Carlton Fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that CourseCompare has named BrainStation the <a href="https://www.coursecompare.ca/best-coding-bootcamps/?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog_CourseCompare&amp;utm_campaign=WD_BestCodingBootcamp">Best Coding Bootcamp for 2021</a>.</p>



<p>CourseCompare is a leading marketplace for digital education, designed to help professionals identify and pursue the most in-demand job skills. Since 2018, CourseCompare has helped more than 500,000 people worldwide pursue new digital skills or launch new careers in business, technology, and design. </p>



<p>To compile its annual rankings for Best Coding Bootcamp, CourseCompare focused on job placement rates as a key metric, while also considering the following performance metrics:</p>



<ul><li>Verified ratings from recent graduates</li><li>Industry recognition and satisfaction from employer feedback</li><li>Graduate earning potential, based on salaries within six months of graduation</li><li>Graduation rates taken from a variety of regulatory sources</li></ul>



<p>“We interviewed bootcamp founders and recent graduates, pored over job placement data, took a deep dive into the curriculum, and toured campuses across the country to determine which coding bootcamps are truly delivering a positive return on investment (ROI) for their students in 2021,” CourseCompare noted on their website.</p>



<h2>What Sets BrainStation Apart</h2>



<p>According to CourseCompare, “BrainStation’s LMS (Learning Management System), Synapse, is among the most sophisticated on offer in Canada. The live online learning platform allows students to attend live lectures, collaborate with other professionals, and get immediate feedback from instructors — wherever they are.”</p>

<h2>What Students Are Saying</h2>

<p>Here are a few samples of alumni reviews from CourseCompare on BrainStation’s Web Development Bootcamp.</p>



<p>“I found the collaborative, hands-on teaching approach allowed me to learn in 12 weeks what would have taken me six months to a year.” &#8211; <strong>Jonny Caron</strong></p>



<p>“I took BrainStation&#8217;s Web Development course. I&#8217;m currently a UX Product Designer and thought it would be great to learn more about how my designs are actually coded and implemented by the team I work with&#8230;Both instructors were super knowledgeable and approachable in the online format, I frequently was able to get one-on-one time to answer questions…” &#8211; <strong>Amber Sewell</strong></p>



<p>“BrainStation has made me a more confident person and has helped me find what I really want to do with my career path. The culture in the classroom is unlike the culture I&#8217;ve experienced in traditional schooling &#8211; everyone is a lot more supportive of one another and not only focused on their own progression. I learned how to learn quickly and apply quickly &#8211; a lasting skill that will definitely be beneficial in the web dev industry in the long run.” &#8211; <strong>Jessica Kwok</strong></p>



<p>“I have nothing but the utmost respect for the entire BrainStation team and I cannot thank them enough for the most amazing educational experience I’ve ever had.” &#8211; <strong>Patrick Isaac</strong><br><br></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Tech Defining the Future of Work </strong>– the latest panel in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on October 8th and featured executives from League, Fiverr, Prudential, and Microsoft. </p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;"> 
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/466624235" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
 </div>




<p>Technology was already transforming the ways we work, both as individuals and as companies, long before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. When offices emptied out earlier in the year, this process was greatly accelerated, which created daunting new challenges – and a few opportunities. The need to adapt the ways we work and the focus on digital continues to this day, and will persist well into the future – even long after the pandemic has ended.</p>



<p>We spoke with four experts – from Microsoft, League, Fiverr, and Prudential – about how they’re leading the monumental shift toward more dispersed ways of working, both for their employees and for the clients they serve.</p>



<p><strong>Embracing Tech Is No Longer Optional</strong></p>



<p>As the pandemic drives workforces to disperse physically, technology has stepped in to keep us connected. The demand for tools like teleconferencing and cloud storage may seem obvious in hindsight, but that doesn’t diminish the challenge of rolling them out rapidly, and at scale.</p>



<p>As Jordan Sheridan, Modern Workplace Lead at Microsoft, explains, “Remote work isn&#8217;t exactly new in 2020, but this is the first time that everybody’s had to embrace it: … What tools do we need? What security considerations do we have? … How do we connect, collaborate? Helping our customers put the infrastructures in place that will allow them to [work remotely] was the biggest challenge about scaling that infrastructure. In April, our CEO said that we saw about two years of acceleration in two months.”</p>



<p>Gil Sheinfeld, CTO of freelancer marketplace Fiverr, agrees with Sheridan. “Since COVID started, the world has been forced to work differently. Remote work and digital transformation are not optional, but mandatory. We’ve seen increased demand for all sorts of business services, especially for e-commerce related services. And also from many businesses who need to transform their business from the offline world to the online world.”</p>



<p>Sheinfeld’s observation speaks to a less obvious demand for new digital tools – namely, ways to help deliver traditionally offline goods and services with the online customer service users have come to expect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every organization is now starting to shift into a technology organization,” says Shradha Prakash, VP Future of Work, Org Design and Talent Enablement at Prudential. “Customers want that one-click experience. And it’s very difficult to replicate that. Businesses that were previously based on relationships, now, suddenly, are more about convenience, more about bringing that same experience to a digital platform. And if we need to provide those kinds of technological enhancements, what are the processes we need to change, and what are the structural implications of it?”</p>



<p>Susan Van Klink, CRO of the health benefits hub League, sees the silver lining in the rush to move services online. “In the accelerated move to the cloud, companies are looking for consumer-centric, personalized, engaging solutions that employees will use.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In League’s field, virtual health care, the pandemic has accelerated that shift “by about a decade,” Van Klink says, “in terms of access to mental health care, access to physical health care, and access to third party solutions that will help people manage their health better. We see all of this as a great thing – but it’s really exposed the need for companies to have a digital footprint and an infrastructure.”</p>



<p><strong>Technological Change Drives Organizational Change</strong></p>



<p>A dispersed workforce, cloud-based tools, and online customer service affect not just the way individuals do their jobs, but also the ways entire organizations operate. One of the first demands this shift placed on businesses was for drastically improved agility.</p>



<p>Van Klink says, “COVID has revealed a lot of gaps in the current system, as it relates to accessibility, lack of data, direct correlation to business continuity, and having a healthy workforce to drive your business forward.” Each of those gaps represents an opportunity for businesses to embrace new ways of working.</p>



<p>Prakash concurs. “It opened up the world for us. Leadership sometimes didn’t have exposure to remote working or virtual environments, and that was constraining their thinking. And suddenly it was like, ‘Oh, now I can actually work in different time zones, I can work out of different cities, I can work out of different talent clusters.’”</p>



<p>That decentralization has translated into deeper changes to managerial structure. Whereas business strategy once came from the top down, a decentralized workforce armed with the correct collaboration tools can generate strategic insights at every level. The result is improved talent enablement, similar to the Japanese concept of <em>kaizen</em>, where business activities are continuously improved by all employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Talent enablement means helping your [people] lead and drive business strategy to produce outcomes,” Prakash explains. “It’s a collective, democratized way of ensuring your talent understands how the work is done and what it requires to get work done.” While this was often outsourced to consulting firms in the past, a more decentralized, democratized workforce means that “everybody in the organization should be responsible for doing it.”</p>



<p><strong>Human Problems Require Human-Centered Solutions</strong></p>



<p>Businesses are, after all, made up of people. But while the problems WFH poses for business are different from the ones we face as individuals, digital tools offer ways to help us adapt.</p>



<p>A major pitfall of working from home is the loss of community – those chance encounters that not only give rise to unexpected opportunities for collaboration, but are also integral to employee’s mental well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There was an organic ability to connect the dots over water coolers and during restroom breaks and in corridors,” Prakash notes. “There was a time when people would meet in the cafeteria and talk about their kids and dogs. Suddenly, that’s losing out, because we don’t bump into each other on a digital platform.”</p>



<p>At League, Van Klink says, they’ve turned to digital tools like Donut to stimulate serendipitous conversation, replicating what happens organically in an office. “The tricky part is maintaining that social connection,” she says. This was especially true in the case of new hires. “We had to create a whole new process around virtual recruiting and onboarding that would help convey the culture of the company without the face-to-face component available to us.” Even social media platforms like Instagram are useful in maintaining visibility to employees and customers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to recruitment efforts at Microsoft, Sheridan says, “We’ve had good success with things like breakout rooms. Instead of a traditional hackathon that you’d do in person in a large room, we set up breakout rooms and send people into smaller group interactions to get that same feel of how they’re interacting together.”</p>



<p>Maintaining a sense of community online – a trend well underway even before the pandemic – is one thing. Addressing the mental strain unique to remote working is quite another. As Sheridan explains, “Your brain actually processes differently as you’re participating in a video call than it would if you were on a conference call or sitting in a meeting room. Technology overload is definitely taking its toll in different ways.” Microsoft Teams has responded by allowing people to sync their teleconferencing backgrounds, “to make the meeting a little bit more engaging, make it feel a little bit more natural, and try to bring down that fatigue.”</p>



<p>Another contributor to fatigue for the WFH set is the gradual blurring of work and home. Counterintuitively, doing away the morning and evening commute hasn’t improved mental well-being; it’s only allowed the stresses of work to bleed into home life. In response, Sheridan’s team has been toying with a virtual commute, “to create that demarcation between the work environment and the home environment” and allow people to shift gears, decompress, and compartmentalize.</p>



<p>Ultimately, our experts are optimistic that we will collectively learn how to regain the benefits of the physical office – the separation of work and home, the sense of community, the ability to collaborate and find spontaneous connections – without losing any of the advantages that remote working offers – like access to a broader talent pool, opportunities to relocate, improved agility, and more input from across a company’s org chart.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, BrainStation expanded our </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/brainstation-expands-revolutionary-online-live-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online learning options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which we call Online Live – making online digital skills training accessible to learners around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Live has since delivered over 150,000 hours of live online instruction to Learners in 50 cities and 17 countries around the world. The future of education, we believe, is online, and the challenges presented by the COVID-19 outbreak have made that increasingly clear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence to back up that belief. A survey of 1,000 online student learners found that 91 percent said it </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/are-online-courses-worth-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved their professional life </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 93 percent said it improved their resume.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, online education can have an impact on career success but it can be an adjustment for those more familiar with in-person learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re considering taking an </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#,online"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or have just started your online training, here are some expert tips for online learning from home.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing Your Learning Space</span></h2>
<p><b>Find a Quiet Space with no Distractions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general consensus among professionals working from home is to find a dedicated workspace. The same applies to those looking to study from home. Find yourself a space that can be dedicated to your online course, and make sure it’s a quiet, well-lit spot that you know you’ll be able to concentrate in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our most successful students tend to be those that have taken the time to create a dedicated study space that is comfortable and free from distraction,&#8221; says Trevor Martin, Digital Marketing Instructor at BrainStation. “Having a separate space reserved for your studies can also help you stay on top of your work and stay motivated in the same that going to a classroom would.”</span></p>
<p><b>Make Sure you Have a Strong Internet Connection</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing interrupts an online lesson like a bad internet connection. If you find your internet is not strong enough at home, look into options at your local library or a nearby co-working space. You might find that colleges or universities in your city have a library open to the public that will be popular amongst those looking for a quiet place to study.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Use a Dual Monitor if Available&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having two monitors is a nice-to-have when learning online. It allows you to see the instructor and classmates while also taking notes, testing out the curriculum, or referring to the deck slides. While this may not be necessary, if you do have a second monitor or tablet to display the course material, this is a good use case for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treat It Like an In-Person Class&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><b>Dress for Success</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that pyjamas are comfortable and relaxing, but that relaxed approach can have an impact on your mindset and motivation. Just like going to an in-person class with other ambitious professionals, you’ll want to dress for success. And besides, dressing the part will save you any embarrassment if you unexpectedly have to answer the door during the class while on camera.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Turn on the Camera</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the real advantages of an </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#,online"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online live course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the ability to work with your classmates and get real-time feedback from your Instructor. Keeping your webcam on allows you to stay attentive to your fellow learners and signal your engagement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always ask Learners to keep their cameras on. It’s a much more personal and engaging experience that way, and I can more easily see which content is resonating, and when it might be time for a break,” Martin says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Ask Questions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need clarity on something, chances are one of your classmates does too. The benefit of Online Live is that you have an Instructor who can immediately help clear up any questions you might have.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be shy to ask questions when learning online, especially when it’s live online instruction. This is an opportunity to talk through ideas with an industry expert – take advantage of it! The other idea to remember is that questions often lead to engaging class discussions about real-life experiences and applications, all of which will improve you overall learning experience,” Martin says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Take Notes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t use online learning as an excuse to just sit back and listen. Most people retain information better when writing it down or translating it into their own words. In fact, according to Professor Walter Paulk at Cornell, only 10 percent of an audio lecture will remain in memory, but students who take and review notes can recall up to 80 percent of a lecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using a second monitor, use it to take notes or keep a notebook and pen beside you to jot down key points and ideas.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the Most Out of Technology</span></h2>
<p><b>Participate in class forums</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online learning courses and programs use messaging systems to encourage collaboration and communication. BrainStation, for example, uses breakout rooms and Slack channels to connect students with their Instructors and classmates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from being a great tool to get feedback on your work, these channels can be a fantastic resource for finding and sharing content. For example, during a Data Analytics course, students might share interesting data visualizations they came across in the news that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of the best projects I’ve seen were born in class Slack channels,” says Martin. “Someone suggests an idea and people get excited about helping that person make it come to life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Use Zoom and Other Collaboration Tools for Group Work</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many in the press have noted, we are currently engaging the world’s largest work-from-home experiment. It seems likely that when a level of normalcy returns to the world, remote work will become more commonplace. There is a secondary benefit to online learning, therefore, as it can provide a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with many of the leading digital collaboration and project management tools, like Zoom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tools are also an easy way for you to stay connected with your classmates and track progress on group work. Try setting up a standard weekly touchpoint with your group members to keep yourself on track.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Expand Your Network</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each learner will have different motivations for enrolling in an online course, but a real benefit may get overlooked is the ability to expand your network. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/using-data-to-drive-community-at-lululemon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Max Smilie, the Regional Community Lead at Lululemon, took a BrainStation Certificate Course to become more data-savvy and ended up meeting like-minded professionals around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people who are in the classes are all working to better themselves and are real go-getters; it felt like a family and I think that’s what made the class so special,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take the networking opportunity a step further, take notes about people’s roles and learning objectives and ask a few for 15-minute virtual “coffee chats” throughout the course. Also, make sure to add the connections you make on LinkedIn to stay in touch after the class.&nbsp;</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job automation is massively transforming our labor force and, for better or worse, will continue to influence what the future of work looks like. From Accountants to Cashiers; Plumbers to Retailers, this </span><a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/07/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study by Ilia Blinderman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the likelihood of different roles becoming automated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new wave of work has been dubbed the fourth industrial revolution, one in which our connection to the internet-of-things trumps hardware and, in many cases, human service.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked into some of the roles Blinderman found were more likely to be automated. See how these roles have evolved and how employees can future-proof their careers to match the pace of technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bank Tellers</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking has come a long way from hand-written ledgers. Now we’re much more likely to complete transactions at ATMs or, of course, on our personal devices. It’s not uncommon to find banks without any money on site. For example, Tangerine’s Cafes provide a space for customers to speak with a financial advisor, but are not set up for regular transactions; there’s no need when everything can be done through their app. Banks like EQ don’t have a physical space at all and have really risen in the digital financial space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks are leaping into the digital space and employees will need to step up their digital know-how to stay ahead. Here’s how:</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding AI to Leverage Robo-Advisors&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve probably heard the term robo-advisors. Investment banks like Betterment are using AI to automate the investment process so that customers can take charge of their own finances, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investments made on data that may be imperceptible to humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these tools work to eliminate the need for Financial Advisors. However, they open up roles in data, development, and <a href="http://bit.ly/3cS7IXN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product management</a> – this tech, which is legitimately shaking up the financial industry, can’t program itself, and those who have the right skills will be well-positioned to advance their careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Technology to Protect Against Fraud&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud departments have also adapted to the digital era, using </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-transforming-banking-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI to analyze behavior </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to determine unusual activity. Remember when your credit card would be blocked every time you booked a flight ticket? Now banks like CIBC are able to track your spending to understand the purchases you make, even if they may not seem unusual to the human eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these tools and techniques continue to take hold, roles in <a href="http://bit.ly/2TYsPyJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">machine learning</a> and AI will increase. There remains, after all, many opportunities for improving the banking process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Shaping FinTech with User Research and Design</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banking apps have optimized user experience (UX) design to make banking more friendly and accessible. There have also been </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ux-design-is-playing-a-role-in-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented to improve clients’ financial habits. Now, without human help, we’re able to perform day-to-day banking from a user-friendly screen. For example, companies like Digit automate your savings by monitoring transactions to make an educated guess about how much you can afford to save. The Mint app allows you to easily create budgets and Clarity Money helps users keep an eye on easy-to-overlook subscriptions draining money from their accounts each month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, as the banking industry continues its digital transformation, <a href="http://bit.ly/2xsvEAB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX Designers</a> will continue to have a wealth of opportunities, helping institutions understand and solve the pain points of their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bookkeepers and Accountants&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Digital_Skills-e1583941610149.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10730" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Digital_Skills-e1583941610149.jpg" alt="illustration of person on computer with charts and rapidly swiping his hand back and forth. making money online" width="700" height="241"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from the University of Oxford showed that Accountants have a 95 percent chance of seeing their jobs automated – and it makes sense. Tedious data-entry no longer requires manpower; AI has the power to create a more efficient and accurate workflow that can cost 40 percent less than current practices. Accountants and accounting firms can minimize risks to their careers and bottom lines by adapting to the new technology, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Using Automation to Change the Game</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software automation tools and bots are able to handle higher volumes of repeatable tasks faster and more accurately than humans, easing the workload for Accountants and Bookkeepers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple companies like ZOHO offer a free invoice creator, Highradius offers a cash application software, which offers an array of automated services that are sure to save time for Accountants. LucaNet allows you to automate data validation when comparing invoices to stock codes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CPA of Canada </span><a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/other-general-business-topics/information-management-and-technology/publications/ai-impact-on-accounting-and-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on this new wave of tech as Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which they described as a set of automation tools that allow users to create their own bots, allowing them to handle “high-volume, low complexity, and repeatable tasks faster and with more accuracy and lower cost than humans.” RPA software can also save a company anywhere from 20 to 60 percent of full-time costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to automation tools and bots will lead to a complete overhaul of the accounting process, ultimately leaving more time for Accountants to focus on less dreary aspects of their role. This also opens up a whole new range of job opportunities in the accounting field in the areas of machine learning, <a href="http://bit.ly/2xxZMe9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI, and data science</a>, which will only increase as automation becomes more prevalent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Leveraging UX Design to Simplify Bookkeeping</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like banking, accounting accessibility increases with good UX design. With streamlined and simplified platforms, small business owners and entrepreneurs are able to manage their own bookkeeping and invoicing with tools like QuickBooks, which takes care of tracking cash flow, creating invoices, paying employees, and more all from an easy-to-use interface.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Accounting Seed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> improves the accounting process by giving you an easy way to get a full view of your business’s cash flow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Mastering Data Analytics</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Accountants have always relied on data and analytics, advancements in machine learning allow professionals to anticipate future outcomes and make data-driven decisions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CPA Canada reports that advanced analytics will enable Accountants to widen and make more decisive KPIs. “The leveraging of Big Data by advanced analytics solutions can help develop deeper understanding of new market trends, identify new KPIs for performance management, and improve accuracy and timeliness of the forecasting process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes on to say that, “There will also be a heavier emphasis on understanding data correlations and trends, which will require a solid understanding of statistical methods such as regression analysis, sample-size determination, and hypothesis testing. [&#8230;] CPAs will also&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to understand how to leverage self-serve data reporting and visualization tools such as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM Cognos BI, SAP BusinessObjects, Microsoft Power BI, and Tableau to create reports and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboards to present new insights to management.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning data analysis and gaining familiarity with tools like Tableau will open up opportunities for Accountants looking to adapt to the future of work. Data analysis courses are a quick way to upskill in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Secretaries and Administrative Assistants</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, devices are able to edit your calendar, research information, make calls, leave reminders, and more – tasks that would have once required an organized secretary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, in fact, proudly shares that Alexa is able to “simplify conference rooms, allowing meeting attendees to start meetings and control the equipment in the room by simply using their voice. Alexa can also do things around the workplace, like providing directions to a conference room, notifying IT about a broken printer, or placing an order for office supplies.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Google recently launched a new feature in which a bot is able to make calls and book appointments as if from a human. With outstanding accuracy, the bot is able to call a restaurant or a hair salon to book an appointment, easily working around rescheduling obstacles and language barriers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JvbHu_bVa_g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true that very few companies have gone that route yet, it is common to be greeted by an iPad in an office lobby. Companies like Greetly offer an app that alerts meeting hosts that a guest has arrived, signs the guest in, provides a name badge, an NDA to be signed, all without a human being involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, these tools replace many of the tasks associated with administrative assistants, but they also open up opportunities for office workers to take on different administrative and operations-based responsibilities. Proactive Administrative Assistants, however, will want to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop new skills, including <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q3ghoI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">design thinking</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/3cS7IXN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product management</a>, and more, to both future-proof themselves and improve the administrative field as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Customer Service Representatives</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Pay_for_my_Training-e1583941838191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10732 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zachary_Monteiro_Pay_for_my_Training-e1583941838191.jpg" alt="illustration of rows of people working on computers in dark blue hues. There is one person highlighted gold amongst the rows." width="700" height="241"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s getting harder and harder to tell if you’re interacting with a human when contacting customer support, and this will likely increase with time. The truth is, the majority of support inquiries are often repeated and easily answered. A chatbot can save lots of time for companies and customers alike who are looking for a quick answer to a team’s FAQ.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Twitter, for example, provide minimal human aid, channeling all of their queries through their Twitter Support Account, which guides you through their FAQs and support center. While convenient, this kind of approach can backfire. Airbnb, for example, has a bad reputation for making it difficult to contact customer support. They don’t provide an email or phone number and instead weave customers through a series of support center links before making a human available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb is not alone, though, as many automated customer service systems are imperfect, creating an opportunity for organizations to differentiate themselves through superior customer service. Uber, for example, makes it quick and easy to report a problem and get a refund with just a few taps, even without human intervention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Improving the CSM Process</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, there are tons of opportunities for organizations to incorporate automation in their customer support processes, which, apart from boosting efficiency and speed, would also significantly change the role of customer service representatives. Instead of spending time doing manual research and handling routine support requests, call center employees assisted by AI could focus on more complex issues, with virtual assistants searching internal databases to find the answers they are looking for, reducing the time it would take to search multiple sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect combination will provide the right amount of convenience and personalized support. For example, Zendesk makes it easier for professionals to manage support tickets, chatbots, and more in a way that simplifies attending to customers highlighting the ways automation can be a helpful and welcome disruptor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Automation and AI Will Create Opportunities&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While large-scale changes inevitably cause anxiety, they also bring about untold opportunity for professionals and organizations willing to <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upskill</a> and reskill. Consider this: A report from McKinsey estimated that overall spending on technology will increase by more than 50 percent in the next decade, creating between 20 and 50 million high-paying jobs around the world.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10717" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH.png" alt="illustration of hand shaking, they are illustrated with computer chip boards on their skin" width="700" height="241" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH.png 3331w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-300x103.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-768x265.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-1024x353.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-960x331.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-331x115.png 331w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BS_Inclusion_IN_TECH-1160x400.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a lot of variables involved in that forecast, it illustrates the potential for automation –&nbsp;if we can really embrace it, we can create a whole new world of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Deloitte Center for the Edge wrote: “We have the potential to create significant new value for the enterprise. And paradoxically, these gains will likely come less from all the new technology than from the human workforce you already have today.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although women now make up half the workforce in the United States, it&#8217;s a well-known fact that the tech industry is dominated by men. According to Adeva, women hold about 25 percent of tech roles and that number drops even lower when looking at the number of women working in leadership roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help inspire the next generation of tech leaders and innovators, we&#8217;re featuring five women who are leading the way in the UX design industry for International Women&#8217;s Day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From women who are breaking into the industry to UX leaders at some of the world&#8217;s most recognizable companies, here are some of the women who are championing diversity and acting as mentors in their field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Elizabeth Churchill&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10703" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10703" class="wp-image-10703 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/elizabeth-e1583507932657.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10703" class="wp-caption-text">Source: EPIC</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no denying Churchill</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a female leader in UX design. With more than 20 years of experience, this Google exec has seen the industry come a long way and she&#8217;s not afraid to call out the idea that emotions are a female-only trait as &#8220;of course, nonsense.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Acknowledging emotional intelligence and emotionality as being fundamentally human means both men and women benefit in the long run,&#8221; said Churchill in an interview with </span><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-series-of-interviews-with-senior-ux-leaders-to-celebrate-international-womens-day-10dc6e354f26"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to her role as the Director of UX for Google&#8217;s Material Design (where she has five female and five male reports on her team), Churchill has also worked at tech giants including Yahoo!, Fuji Xerox, and eBay. Plus, she&#8217;s had a long academic career, written books about the design field, and is the current Secretary/Treasurer of the Association for Computing Machinery, the world&#8217;s largest scientific and educational computing society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Lizzie Kelly-Dyson and Georgie Bottomley</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10713" style="width: 898px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-duo-copy-e1583509846882.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10713" class="size-full wp-image-10713" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-duo-copy-e1583509846882.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="300"></a><p id="caption-attachment-10713" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Twelve Scholars and georgiebottomley.com</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Manchester-based Lizzie Kelly-Dyson and Georgie Bottomley wanted to meet more women in the UX design industry, they decided to do something about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started</span><a href="https://www.ladiesthatux.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladies That UX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because we didn&#8217;t know any women in the industry. Around eight people turned up for our first meeting, which was amazing because that&#8217;s eight people that we&#8217;ve never met before,&#8221; said Kelly-Dyson on a podcast called</span><a href="https://hubhopper.com/episode/lizzie-kelly-dyson-step-outside-your-comfort-zone-1579180067"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve Scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News of the UX meetup quickly spread and today there are more than 30 Ladies That UX groups in cities across Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. There&#8217;s no set format for a meeting, but each Ladies That UX group has a common theme: a community of women in UX who support each other, push the UX boundaries, and promote female skill and talent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I hope that every woman has the chance to achieve more through knowing she is not the only one out there, and by finding support in our community,&#8221; said Bottomley about the networking community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Jessica Gaddis</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10705" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10705" class="wp-image-10705 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jessica-e1583509229255-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10705" class="wp-caption-text">Source: jmgaddis.com</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite growing up with parents who worked in the industry and learning how to code at a young age,</span><a href="http://www.jmgaddis.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaddis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t see herself working in tech. It wasn&#8217;t until she pursued worked on a digital storytelling project in journalism school that she started to consider a career in the tech industry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, Gaddis landed a product design role at Netflix and now works as a Product Designer at Twitter. In an interview for</span><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/interviews/women-ux-meet-jessica-gaddis-former-journalist-turned-self-taught-product-designer-netflix/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe&#8217;s XD Idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog, she spoke about some of the challenges of being a black woman in UX design, including a lack of awareness that UX jobs exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m passionate about giving young women all of the opportunities, all of the knowledge, and all of the information to make more informed decisions about their roles. Even if no one goes into design that’s a black woman ever again, I want women to be able to make those decisions for themselves and know that there is stuff out there for them that maybe they wouldn’t account for, or they wouldn’t even strive to,” said Gaddis.</span></p>
<h2><b>Julie Zhou&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10706" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10706" class="wp-image-10706 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julie.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10706" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Diversity in STEAM</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve used Facebook in the past ten years there’s a good chance </span><a href="https://www.juliezhuo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Zhou</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played a role in your experience. Zhou is Chinese-American woman who started as an intern at Facebook and, over 14 years, moved her way up to the Vice President of Product Design position. She has since left Facebook and turned her attention to the publishing and public speaking world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite achieving success at a young age, Zhou was not immune from a common experience many women in the tech industry face: the imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Experience makes anything look easy, but insecurities never fully disappear. This is true for everyone, especially true for women, and truer still for women in male-dominated fields,” said Zhou on </span><a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhou faced those feelings head-on in her much-loved book released last year, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check it out to find out more about Zhou’s experience of being a leader at a young age and how to unlock your confidence even when you feel like you don’t know what you’re doing.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about user experience (UX) in the context of shopping, we usually refer to the digital sphere, where UX Designers help to ideate, test, tweak and optimize every element of websites, apps and other products to ensure users will have the best-possible end-to-end eCommerce experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the same principles that have made UX Design such a crucial part in online shopping – that good design puts people first, blends eye-catching esthetics with an unwavering commitment to usability, and is backed by rigorous research and testing – are having a transformative effect on brick-and-mortar retail, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth pointing out just how important that is. U.S. Census data showed that eCommerce sales comprised 11.2 percent of total sales in the third quarter of 2019. So while eCommerce continues to take on a larger role in the overall retail landscape, it’s clear the vast majority of purchases are still being made in person at physical stores.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, the store is still the foundation of retailing,” observed BRP, a retail management consultancy, in its 2019 Special Report: The Future Store. “It is where the tactile and sensory experience comes together for the consumer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And companies adopting UX principles for all customer interactions – online or otherwise – are thriving; research by SAP, Siegel+Gale and Shift Thinking found that today’s top brands treat their customers as users, not buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the world’s top companies are getting quite creative in how they apply UX design concepts to optimize the experience of the people coming through their stores. Read on for a few of the ways UX has impacted retail.</span></p>
<h3><b>Invasion of the Pop-Ups</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we’ve pointed out that most shoppers are still making purchases in person, a store’s online presence is still crucial. Data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 63 percent of shopping occasions begin online, but the lines between the experience of shopping online and in-person are getting blurrier and blurrier as companies focus more attention on user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of how that’s manifested? More online retailers are pushing to establish physical spaces, if even for a short time in the form of pop-ups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital retailers like M.Gemi, Casper, and Allbirds have used pop-ups to introduce new products, to allow potential customers an up-close look at their products, and to generally create buzz and real-world visibility for their brands. Beauty startup Glossier has gone all-in on pop-ups, generating major media attention last year with six-to-eight week stints in cities including London, Seattle, and Miami. Clothing retailer Everlane, meanwhile, opened a few physical stores that don’t actually hold any stock so that potential customers could try on their wares before completing their purchase online (with free shipping).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online retailers that open brick-and-mortar locations report a five- to eight-fold increase in sales. But more than that, they also help to establish a relationship with customers and help potential buyers get a better feel for their products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stores serve as showrooms that drive customers online,” </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevendennis/2017/04/10/wall-streets-misguided-and-dangerous-fascination-with-retail-store-productivity/#3799f67b31f4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Steven Dennis in a Forbes op-ed warning Wall Street firms against closing too many physical stores. “Stores serve as fulfillment points for eCommerce operations. Stores are billboards for a retail brand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond online retailers looking to establish a physical presence – and perhaps a closer relationship with customers – the pop-up is also being used by established brands to lure shoppers in with one-of-a-kind experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muji opened a pop-up apartment in London to introduce its new home and clothing collections, inviting customers to masterclass workshops on topics including storage, Japanese beauty tutorials, and Instagram photography, while in New York the brand offered up a DIY essential oil bar and an embroidery service.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10624 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8.jpg" alt="Muji pop up apartment" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/muji-life-pop-up-covent-garden-8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well-established department stores, meanwhile, are increasingly bringing customers back by partnering with in-demand brands for splashy pop-ups. The first four floors of Bloomingdale’s locations in New York, L.A. and San Francisco feature the Carousel, a 1,500-square-foot “pop-in” with fresh designs and merchandise produced every two months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These pop-ups rarely just offer products; they instead try to bring other experiential benefits to not just bring customers through their doors, but also create a deeper connection to their brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our big focuses is to create these ever-changing and very exciting elements to continue to drive customers to our stores,” </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-27/pop-up-stores-are-the-next-big-retail-strategy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Justin Berkowitz, Men’s Fashion Director for Bloomingdale’s. “I really think that for the future of retail, (it’s important to make) brick-and-mortar a place where the customer really wants to come.” </span></p>
<h3><b>Using VR and AR to Improve the Shopping Experience </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s at least one advantage brick-and-mortar stores have that can’t be replicated on the web or your phone: the opportunity to showcase innovative new tech installations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many companies are understandably rushing to load their flagship stores with innovative new tools that most shoppers have likely never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the tech isn’t just about wowing guests with cool gimmicks – in fact, it’s all oriented around providing the best possible user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, how many of us really enjoy the process of dragging piles of clothing back to a cramped changeroom to see what fits? Well, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, and Selfridges have all partnered with 3D-body-scanning companies to help customers find the right fit without the changeroom headaches. A customer can get scanned in-store and the software then compares the measurements with the exact dimensions of the clothes on offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers are doing impressive things with augmented reality, too. Consider Ikea Place, an augmented reality app that allows shoppers to choose one of the furniture giant’s colorfully named products and drop it into their own home to see how it looks before buying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adidas, meanwhile, used AR to deepen the connection between its customers and its products. The shoe company’s Parley collection of shoes is made from plastic trash collected from remote beaches and coastal communities. The company installed AR displays in its retail stores that – with a snap of a photo from a customer – would physically show how the shoes on the shelf in front of them were created from recycled materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conscientious shoe brand TOMS used virtual reality to similarly help customers to understand the brand’s social impact. The company’s 360-degree Virtual Giving Trip lets potential customers see the impact of TOMS’ one-for-one business model by allowing them to virtually travel around the world and experience first-hand what it’s like to give a pair of TOMS shoes to a child in need.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.with.in/embed/toms-virtual-giving-trip" width="540" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, some companies are using the latest tech to both pamper their guests and give them all the benefits of shopping online in their brick-and-mortar locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebecca Minkoff’s “connected” stores offer a range of impressive tech tricks to help ensure the best possible customer experience (they’re also smartly collecting data on which items are taken to the fitting room and whether those garments are then bought or left behind). The company’s sprawling Soho store features interactive screens that look like mirrors when they’re not activated. If shoppers give them a tap, they can browse company-curated lookbooks or order a free coffee or a glass of champagne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, RFID tags recognize all the items brought into the fitting room, and shoppers can then pull up screens showcasing the clothes styled in various ways, or browse other available size or colors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology – powered by eBay – led to sales tripling at that store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have focused on organizing stores around products, but our vision is organizing stores around customers,” </span><a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/rebecca-minkoff-digital-store/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Geisinger, eBay’s Head of Retail and Mobile Innovation. “Customers are demanding more experience, more engagement, and the feeling and the activity of shopping is more important than it used to be.”</span></p>
<h3><b>An Experience You Can’t Have at Home</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since online shopping is generally the most convenient option, many brands are working overtime to make sure that a visit to their store is worth the time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more, retailers are offering experiences and services that extend far beyond their central product offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the recreational apparel company Outdoor Voices, which has stores and pop-ups in cities around the U.S., none of which feel alike, instead reflecting their local environments. The brand’s San Francisco location pulls out all the stops, with a tearoom, in-store yoga classes, and meet-ups for jogging or dog-walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think of each store as a resource for recreation, and each needs to flex locally based on both the area and what type of activities people like to do there,” </span><a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/outdoor-voices-new-san-francisco-shop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Founder and CEO Tyler Haney. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies have opted to invest in at least one landmark location that serves to make people excited about their brand. Reinforcing the company’s connection to skateboarding culture, House of Vans London, for instance, is a 30,000 square-foot space that spans an art gallery, an artist incubator space, a cinema, a live music venue, a café and bars, a skater-built concrete bowl, mini-ramp, and street course. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10626 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London.jpg" alt="House of Vans London" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London.jpg 750w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/House_of_Vans_London-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Apple has in recent years refreshed its stores to provide an even better experience for customers. In 2016, Angela Ahrendts, the company’s Senior Vice President of Retail, unveiled innovations that included a tree-lined Genius Grove (replacing the Genius Bar), the introduction of “Creative Pros” offering specialized advice on a range of artistic topics, and a new program where customers would have the opportunity to attend sessions and community events within the Apple space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s funny, we actually don’t call them ‘stores’ anymore. We call them ‘town squares’ because they’re gathering places for 500 million people who visit us every year,” Ahrendts </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/meet-the-woman-who-wants-to-change-the-way-you-buy-your"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We view our stores as a modern-day town square, where visitors come to shop, be inspired, learn or connect with others in their community.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><b>Personalization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of eCommerce, brands are increasingly focused on trying to anticipate what you want and when you want it. According to the Boston Consulting Group, companies that use advanced personalization methods can realize an improvement of 20 percent or greater in their net promoter scores, while seeing incremental revenue growth of 10 percent or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the flow of data available online makes it easy to know everything about the people browsing your web products. You don’t have that same treasure trove of background information about the people physically browsing your store, but that’s not stopping brands from getting creative about personalizing brick-and-mortar shopping experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One effective method? Loyalty programs. According to BCG’s numbers, 130 million Americans are now members of a restaurant loyalty program, more than twice as many as in 2015. More than two-thirds of diners are members of at least one such program, and a quarter belong to three or more. BCG’s numbers show that restaurant companies with “well-defined, strategically executed” loyalty programs can boost incremental revenues by 10 to 15 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at Starbucks, whose loyalty program is hailed as an industry leader. Starbucks tailors messages and offers to its members based on their past ordering habits. Haven’t had a latte for a few days? Starbucks might lure you in the door with a half-price offer, or by enticing you with bonus stars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a huge success. According to Starbucks’ 2019 third-quarter results, active Starbucks Rewards Membership in the U.S. increased 14 percent year-over-year to 17.2 million users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have made massive investments and made progress on personalization, ahead of what I would say other restaurant brands to date have been able to accomplish,” </span><a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/personalized-fast-food-experiences"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Martin, a Partner at BCG.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies are tapping into apps to personalize their brick-and-mortar stores. If you walk into a Best Buy, for example, the app will enter “local store” mode with relevant push notifications, while Nike app users at its midtown Manhattan flagship can tap into advice from one-on-one stylists or create customized products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those companies that aren’t yet able to leverage technology to offer a personalized in-store experience in real-time can do more to cater to their customers. The same data that provides such valuable insights about a store’s online users can be leveraged to create an in-store experience that appeals to its unique customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something that we’re focused a lot on right now is using all of this data, and feedback, and information to personalize experiences,” </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/8-experts-on-the-future-of-retail"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mary Anne Savoie, Director of Customer Experience at Mejuri.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s no longer ‘who is our target market?’ but ‘who are our customers?’ Each persona deserves to be communicated to uniquely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has also allowed retailers to take personalization to the next level by creating customized gear on the spot. The Nike By You Studio uses augmented reality, object tracking, and projection systems to allow users to make custom kicks they can pick up just an hour later, while luxury handbag brand launched the Coach Create design-it-yourself experience at its New York flagship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ministry of Supply permanently installed a pricey 3D-knitter in its Boston flagship to allow customers to design and create their own blazers (and other wares) on demand. Ministry of Supply Co-Founder Aman Advani said that giving people the option to customize products isn’t just about generating sales, but more about the overall experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These stores transform into places where you go to learn more about the brand, to help create your product, to understand who is behind the product, to connect with the person who your online inquiry was answered by,” he </span><a href="https://qz.com/956745/retail-experiments-from-farfetch-nike-and-amazon-offer-visions-of-the-store-of-the-future/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They become much more beacons of the brand and much less just transactional retail machine.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about how </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-toronto-became-a-global-tech-leader-in-7-years/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto became a tech leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-reasons-why-torontos-tech-industry-continues-to-soar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the sector continues to soar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the city’s growth is not limited to jobs in tech. According to the Rider Levett Bucknall Crane Index, Toronto is home to the most construction cranes in North America, with 97 currently in use. This is the second year in a row the Ontario capital has led the crane count, and what’s more astonishing is that there are another 393 proposed skyscrapers, with 10.1 million square feet of new office space in the pipeline for Toronto’s core.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Toronto – already the biggest city in Canada – is changing and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are six construction projects that will have a big impact on Toronto’s tech industry.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>The Well</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread over seven and a half acres, and just down the street from BrainStation’s Toronto campus, The Well is set to make a large impact on the already tech-focused King West neighborhood. The mixed-use project, which is already under construction, includes five residential towers and two office buildings.</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well.jpeg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-1024x781.jpeg" alt="The Well - Toronto" class="wp-image-10474" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-1024x781.jpeg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-300x229.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-768x585.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well-960x732.jpeg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Well.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, the development will provide:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1-million-square-feet of office space</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500,000-square-feet of retail space</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,700 condo and apartment units</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 35,000-square-foot glass canopy atop open-air walkways</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thermal energy storage facility</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40- to 60-feet wide pedestrian street corridors and walkways</span></li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-1024x688.jpg" alt="the well project in Toronto" class="wp-image-10475" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-768x516.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2-960x645.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/the-well-2.jpg 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set for completion in 2022, the project has already secured two big-name tenants: e-commerce platform Shopify, which has announced a $500 million investment to take over the project’s signature office tower at the corner of Front and Spadina; and Spaces, the Amsterdam-based co-working office company, will have over 127,158-sq-feet of office space in the project’s second office tower.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><strong>Sidewalk Labs</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2017, Google’s sister company Sidewalk Labs announced it would develop Quayside, a 12-acre site just east of the Downtown Toronto core. Since then, the company has released a 1,524-page-long draft master plan that was both praised for its ambition and criticized for overstepping its initial boundaries (and helping to bring on a data-driven, dystopian future). In short, there is a lot that remains to be seen.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we do know is that Sidewalk Labs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says it will spend $1.3 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the “neighborhood of the future in Toronto.” And this investment will help create 44,000 jobs, $4.3 billion in annual tax revenues, and at least $38 billion in private sector investment by 2040.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes:</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 new mixed-use buildings, including thousands of new residential units, retail and office spaces. These would be the largest collection of mass timber buildings in the world</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Canadian headquarters of Google&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to extend the city’s light-rail system&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redesigned streets that promote biking and walking</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to reduce greenhouse gases by up to 89 percent</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Wi-Fi and a number of “sensors” that will controversially collect “urban data”&nbsp;</span></li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sidewalk labs Toronto" class="wp-image-10479" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sidwalk-labs.jpg 2667w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>East Harbour</strong></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located on 60-acres of land east of Toronto’s downtown core (and just north of the future Sidewalk Labs site), East Harbour is a massive commercial project that aims to be both a new employment node and a secondary transportation hub for the city.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to transform skill sets and prepare individuals for careers in digital marketing, the 12-week Digital Marketing Bootcamp is available at BrainStation’s state-of-the-art campuses.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After overwhelming demand for our part-time digital marketing certificate courses, we’re very proud to announce the launch of BrainStation’s full-time Digital Marketing Diploma Bootcamp, which is a natural addition to our suite of diploma programs,” said Jason Field, BrainStation Founder and CEO.</span></p>



<h2><b>It’s a Great Time to Be a Digital Marketer&nbsp;</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than $270 billion dollars was spent on digital ads around the world last year, and close to 70 percent of all companies are now hiring marketers – with demand increasing every year!</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation&#8217;s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-digital-marketing-bootcamp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing Bootcamp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to prepare you for these exciting career opportunities, providing real-world project work, industry networking opportunities, and ongoing career guidance and professional development.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked with hiring partners from some of the most innovative companies to design a Digital Marketing program that truly prepares professionals for the workplace. This “by industry for industry” approach has helped us achieve an employment rate of over 97% for our diploma programs around the world,” Field said.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><b>What You&#8217;ll Learn</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation’s Digital Marketing Diploma Program will give you a comprehensive understanding of digital marketing strategy, concepts, and techniques, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>Search engine marketing<br></b>Learn SEO, Google Ad, and Facebook Ad principles to increase online visibility, domain and page authority.</p>



<p><b>Content marketing<br></b>Develop a global content strategy, including keyword research with Google Keyword Planner, content development, key metrics, and more.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out more about the </span></i><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-digital-marketing-bootcamp"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Marketing Bootcamp</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like all of BrainStation&#8217;s Diploma Programs, the Digital Marketing Program is delivered in a dynamic learning environment, built on collaboration and feedback, which gives students the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and work on real-world projects. For over 40 hours a week, they learn and apply new concepts, with an extremely intimate student-to-teacher ratio – It’s common to find classes of 30 students with up to five Educators providing feedback,” Field said.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s closer to ‘on-the-job-training’ than ‘going back to school,’ which means that when you graduate, you’ll have the marketing skills and confidence to excel, as well as real portfolio pieces to show off. The ROI is quite clear.”&nbsp;</span></p>



<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation’s Career Success Program&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation graduates have a </span><b>97% employment rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within 180 days of graduation, and the Career Success Program is a major reason why.
