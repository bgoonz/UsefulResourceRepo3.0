<p><strong>How to Become a Digital Leader in 2021 – </strong>the latest installment in BrainStation’s 2021 Digital Leadership Event Series – took place on April 29 and featured leaders from <strong>Twitch, Amazon Web Services, The New York Times, </strong>and <strong>Peloton.</strong></p>



<p>You can watch the recap here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/543809303" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the rapid rate of change in today’s digital world, leaders must understand disruptive technologies – both those that are currently molding the market as well as those hovering on the horizon – and how to leverage the latest tech innovations to stand out in a crowded competitive field.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But how do you strategize for the future when even the present is in flux? To find out, BrainStation’s panel gathered cross-functional business and technology leaders to break down the most important disciplines, technologies, and trends that any forward-thinking professional should be thinking about in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>A User-Centric Future</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As more and more businesses are wisely trying to prioritize user experience, forward-thinking companies are looking for ways to turn up the volume on customer feedback.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a direct-t0-consumer brand, Peloton is ahead of the pack in this area. As Peloton Director of Product Arjun Gopalratnam explains, Peloton members are uniquely vocal and honest with their opinions. And when it’s time to make decisions that affect its product or experience, Peloton is sure to bring its members along for the ride.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“When you have a brand that has such obsessive loyalty as ours does, people really feel like you are part of their family and they won’t hesitate to tell you their feedback, positive or negative. We use every bit of that to improve the product,” Gopalratnam said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We use that kind of information to figure out which direction we’re going to go.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>User feedback is of course crucial when the company is testing, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We often launch software to a small subset of the population. We determine if it&#8217;s hitting our KPI, whatever we were trying to move. And if it isn&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not shy about pulling it back, maybe canceling that and regenerating it internally and then pushing it forward again.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>An important point about being user-centric in 2021 and beyond? Doing so requires considering the needs of all users in all their global diversity, pointed out Sharmeen Browarek Chapp, Twitch’s Vice President of Community.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Digital leadership means being conscious of the responsibility that we carry in a world where our online products reach people across the world, across country borders,” Chapp said. “We have to take a global perspective of how we design our products for our customers and have that be at the heart of everything that we do.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>The Era of Data Continues</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In recent years, big data has dominated discussions around business and tech, with companies scrambling to invest in data science and analytics – as well as subset disciplines like machine learning and A.I. – to unlock the power and potential of the reams of data now being collected.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But when it comes to converting all that information into insights, most businesses are only scratching the surface of what is possible. In BrainStation’s 2020 Digital Skills Survey, for instance, 83 percent of data professionals ranked the data literacy in their organization as intermediate or low – and given the ever-growing amounts of data being collected, that data literacy gap needs to close, fast.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“If you look at IDC data coming out of Internet of Things sensors – that could be a sensor on your tire or a traffic light or on a boat in the ocean – the data that’s coming in there has now increased four hundred percent. That means that in the last year, 56 billion connected devices will generate 79 zettabytes of data,” said Sandy Carter, Vice President, WWPS Partners and Programs for Amazon Web Services (AWS).&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We are seeing a gap, but a resurgence in the focus on data. We’re seeing more and more organizations try to utilize data in the cloud to make better business decisions,” she added.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Whether an organization is a large enterprise or a small business, this data-led approach – especially as you’re digitizing – will turn out to be more and more important.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Meanwhile, forward-thinking companies are also already thinking about the effect any new privacy laws or regulation could have on the collection of data.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“In the age of increasing privacy policies, the traditional methods brands used to target audiences are slowly becoming obsolete,” said Keith McLeod, Vice President, Marketing Operations, The New York Times. “I personally think right now that for brands, that’s the No. 1 thing we’re thinking about: how we will operate in the future without using cookies. You really can’t talk to your customers in the future in the way we know today.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>No Process is Safe from Scrutiny</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sometimes, being forward-thinking requires taking a long look at what you’ve done in the past.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That was true for The New York Times. As McLeod explained it, the company has transformed itself and remained effective and efficient in part by constantly re-evaluating its practices and processes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Let me set the table for everyone who might remember The New York Times as the old grey lady – at this point, it’s more than just a core newspaper or digital asset. We have products in cooking, games, we also have ventures in TV like <em>Modern Love</em>, working with Amazon. So it&#8217;s a huge entity. It&#8217;s a media company now with over seven million subscribers,” McLeod said. “As it pertains to innovation, when I think deeply about it, it’s not just technology innovation.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We spent a good part of the year essentially just doing addition by subtraction. We were decommissioning various tools and platforms that really no longer met our strategic initiatives,” he added.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Really, our commitment and dedication to process and process re-engineering is part of our DNA.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>A Hard Look at Soft Skills</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When looking ahead to an uncertain future, it’s tempting to focus on the hard, technical skills that will surely be needed to leverage the latest leading-edge technologies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But several leaders on BrainStation’s panel pointed out that the most essential quality for thriving in an ever-changing landscape is actually a soft skill: curiosity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“I actually lean more heavily on the soft skills than the technical skills,” said Gopalratnam. “I think empathy and experimentation and understanding of other people is so important in order to push any of our organizations forward.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Along with that, I would describe curiosity as being really key and kind of indicative of whether someone is going to succeed or not.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Carter agreed that an inquisitive nature is a quality most digital leaders seem to share.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“On average, we as adults only ask about 10 questions a day, but all of these digital leaders ask hundreds of questions a day,” said Carter, citing research in the book <em>The Creator’s Code: The Six Essential Skills of Extraordinary Entrepreneurs.</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“If you’ve ever been in a narrative review with Jeff Bezos, you know that’s true – he wants to know everything. He’s curious,” she continued. “I do believe that a digital leader needs to have digital literacy and the soft skills of curiosity to really breakthrough with those new disruptions that digital enables you to do.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Lessons From the Pandemic</strong></h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>No company could really have planned for the pandemic, so the recent health crisis tested virtually everyone’s ability to adapt and adjust.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Browarek Chapp explained, the lessons learned during this time are too valuable to be ignored.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“In this new world of digital leadership, we have to be flexible. The pandemic put us in a situation that nobody would have anticipated, but it&#8217;s also taught us that we can work remotely and we can still be successful companies driving change across the world,” Browarek Chapp said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“I really encourage everybody to think about how in a future where things might be going back to normal, it&#8217;s going to be a new normal. It&#8217;s not the one that was before. And so how do we want to adapt the way our teams work together to build great products for customers? And what does that look like moving forward?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Others on the panel agreed that, with help from work management platforms, having employees working from home hasn’t hurt productivity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Frankly, we&#8217;re actually delivering and getting products and assets out the door faster than we actually were in person,” McLeod said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Miami&#8217;s Digital Future: Success in 2021 and Beyond – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on March 24, and featured four of Miami&#8217;s tech titans from <strong>Softbank Group International</strong>, <strong>Cisneros</strong>, and <strong>aïre ventures</strong>, and special guest Francis Suarez, <strong>Mayor of Miami</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/528967739" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Miami’s digital landscape has exploded over the past few years, especially in 2020 as global companies continue to tap into Miami’s unique ecosystem of highly-qualified, diverse talent, and business-friendly conditions.</p>



<p>Our Vice President and General Manager of BrainStation Miami, Johanna Mikkola, connected with Leigh-Ann Buchanan from <strong>aïres ventures</strong>, Adriana Cisneros, Chief Executive Officer at <strong>Cisneros</strong>, Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at <strong>SoftBank Group International</strong>, and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, to discuss how Miami can capitalize on this unique moment to ensure prosperity for businesses and tech talent.</p>



<h2>Turning Miami Into a Tech Hub</h2>



<p>During an active moment on social media, where people were discussing the possible future for tech in Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez typed four words that would shift the conversation for good: How can I help?</p>



<p>“I had no expectation that it would be the kind of viral sensation that it was,” said Suarez about his offer to help promote technological growth in the city. “We have been trying to systematically create a tech ecosystem in Miami for the past 10 years. Changing the reputation of a city is like moving a cruise ship&#8230;. I felt like I went out there and got a bunch of tugboats and just dropped them onto the cruise ship and just turned it as fast as I could.”</p>



<p>Shu Nyatta, Managing Partner at Softbank International Group, recently moved to Miami himself, and is excited about what the city has to offer. “We kind of understand that when you have a confluence of technological shifts and geography that&#8217;s ready, you get really explosive outcomes.”</p>



<p>“It’s been fun to see when you have a lot of smart people living in the same area,” said Adriana Cisneros, CEO of Cisneros. “The local initiatives, universities, and professors who are in touch and very smart people wanting to help up [Miami’s] game.”<br></p>



<h2>Be Intentional With Inclusivity</h2>



<p>With the increased buzz around South Florida’s budding entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is then the issue of accessibility for those wanting to participate. Leigh-Ann Buchanan emphasized that diversity, equity, and inclusion opportunities don’t happen by accident. They require intentional and frequent communications in order to design the right solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is so much that we can do,” Cisneros added. “There is the notion of inspiring by example. We shouldn’t do things to tick boxes, we should do them because they’re good for business and are the right thing to do.”</p>



<p>“We have a blank canvas as we grow the ecosystem at a feverish pace,” said Suarez. “But to create an equal playing field is to empower particularly children&#8230;and adults who are supposed to have the same set of tools. We need to support organizations that are working and creating opportunities in an equitable fashion and Miami has the opportunity to get it right.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the needs and the current technical abilities, there are, however, a few gaps that need to be addressed to support the growth Miami has the potential to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no talent gap, but there is a skills gap,” said Nyatta. “[Softbank is] focused on bridging that digital skills gap in Miami. But there is also a permission gap, as ecosystems that are centred around entrepreneurship often don’t give permission for young people to take risks. This has been the secret sauce of Silicon Valley, giving people permission to screw up and unlocking that permission is the most powerful thing a person can do for growth.”</p>



<p>With post-graduate programs focused on providing digital skills training and Miami becoming a study destination for students, Cisneros is excited to see what is in store for the next wave of workers.</p>



<p>“Miami is still a new city. I’ve heard people say it’s like a silly putty in that you can shape it into what you want it to be. People want to hear about what you&#8217;re working on. Compared to other cities, it&#8217;s genuinely welcoming and you don’t need to have money or power to be accepted into a group you&#8217;re interested in.”<br></p>



<h2>Embrace the Global Yet Local Opportunities</h2>



<p>Buchanan described Miami as a visionary city in what it can support and what people can bring into the community. As it relates to digital talent, Mayor Francis acknowledged there is more than training alone that needs to be done to further Miami’s digital future.</p>



<p>“Our infrastructure [needs to] keep pace with the growth that we’re innovating,” he said. “We obviously want to focus on continuing to make Miami affordable, not just through public private partnerships on affordable housing, but making sure that we have continued supply of housing and which thankfully we do.”</p>



<p>Physical infrastructure plans have also included having direct flights to Asia, which would make Miami one of the most accessible American cities.</p>



<p>Nyatta noted, “A lot of the Miami talk has been about Miami and the U.S: Miami versus Silicon Valley, Miami versus Austin. The discussion I haven&#8217;t heard as much, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s happening is Miami is a global metropolis&#8230;Miami is Hong Kong. Miami is Singapore. Miami is Dubai. It is a culturally situated city with very powerful cultural dynamics that are super interesting and unique and specific and authentic with global potential, with a global airport, with global access.”</p>



<p>With his sights on international connections, Mayor Francis is already thinking ahead on how Miami can get involved with the next generation of verticals such as deep machine learning, Cryptocurrencies, and HealthTech.</p>



<p>“We want to be positioned to be the city that is most forward thinking,” he said. “What that means is as our children grow, they have permission to dream, succeed, and fail and have the ecosystem to support that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think this focus on talent is important,” said Cisneros. “Of course good companies always attract talent, but it&#8217;s also very cool to be able to grow the talent from the 305. It’s good for them and it’s good for the city.”</p>



<p>Nyatta noted that while the energy and excitement is excellent fuel, there needs to be continued strategy year over year to solidify the success Miami is poised to achieve.</p>



<p>“This is not even a marathon, it&#8217;s like an ultra marathon. Maintaining intention and strategic clarity over decades is actually the trick, not just a couple of quarters of buzz. Finding ways to build that intentionality into institutions that outlast political cycles, that outlast fund lives is the trick. I think trying to embed these ideas as much as we can into things that will outlive us is the task at hand rather than let&#8217;s just create a lot of attention right now.”</p>



<p>Mayor Suarez agreed, adding that an effective long-term plan starts with preparing Miamians for success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The truth that we all understand is tech is here to stay. If we want to create an equitable economy, we need to provide the right tools and opportunities for people to access those tools.”<br></p>
