<p>Cover letters, resumes, and networking are an important part of the job application process. But to really stand out and show off your skills, there’s another tool that every digital marketing professional should add to their job search toolkit: the portfolio.</p>



<p><strong>From TikTok to Clubhouse</strong> – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on May 27th, and featured the experts who lead social and digital engagement at <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, branding agency <strong>Sid Lee</strong>, and disruptive beauty company <strong>DECIEM</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a platform for marketing, social media has been growing for years. But while advertising buys are becoming more streamlined (especially with the increase in user and demographic data that social media can provide), achieving valuable organic reach is still elusive – especially as a host of new platforms leaves audiences more fragmented than ever.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s opportunity in these changes. The arrival of new platforms creates new ways to reach potential customers and new ways to interact with them – and as these audiences fragment, it gives marketers the ability to target their outreach more precisely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Into this shifting landscape, 2020 introduced a global pandemic, widespread lockdowns, and massive social protests – to name just a few of last year’s most transformative events. Each of them threw Social Media Marketers another curveball, forcing them to find ways to adapt. But in at least some of these challenges was a chance to connect with audiences in meaningful ways and build digital communities that will hopefully continue to thrive even as the pandemic winds down.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How have recent events shaped the world of social media marketing? What changes can we expect to see in the future, and how to best capitalize on them?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>A.I. Is Becoming Indispensable</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As social media audiences grow and diversify, brands have more opportunities than ever to personalize their outreach to each user for more effective results – but the explosion in data is more than anyone can manage single-handedly. Fortunately, data analytics and A.I. are stepping up to help Marketers understand user behavior and tailor their social media strategies around the actions that will be most impactful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Corissa Henry, Head of Digital at beauty company DECIEM, explains, “Two things that I’ve seen grow quite a bit in importance across all the brands that I’ve worked with have been the roles of artificial intelligence and personalization. And those two are actually quite intertwined. A.I. allows you to analyze consumer behavior and search patterns, and to use that data to help you understand how your customers are finding your products or services. This can then help you personalize how you approach those customers, so you can send the right message to the right person at the right time. What I’ve seen across all of the brands I’ve worked with is this evolution toward focusing in on who your customers are, where they are, and how to speak to them in a way that’s relevant to them, rather than just blasting information at them.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>One Platform Can Host Many Communities</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This deep knowledge of your customers – where they are and how to reach them – is becoming indispensable as social media platforms proliferate; each platform is unique in its tone, culture, and the type of content that performs. But these individual platforms are diversifying as well, becoming home to myriad micro-communities united by interests that range from the fundamental to the highly esoteric.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>TikTok, for example, launched with a relatively homogenous group of users. But the power of TikTok’s algorithm is how quickly it learns what viewers want to engage in, showing them more of that type of content, even in niche categories. In this way, TikTok is able to assemble loose communities along extremely fine-grained interests – which can be gold to marketers who know how to connect to them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“There are hundreds of different communities that exist and operate distinctly on each social platform,” explains Jason Berk, Head of Social and Digital at branding agency Sid Lee. “What started as a pocket of people that created a close-knit, very specific, narrow community then started growing and adding more people….[Today,] it’s lots of different people of different demographics – a thriving LGBTQ+ community, people of color, DIYers, gamers, animal lovers, foodies, cosplayers, people in uniform….There’s a lot of the world that quite often major media doesn’t pay attention to. But they’re on TikTok….That’s really great about TikTok for marketers – if you have something to sell and there’s a specific demo, it’s there on TikTok.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, is the birthplace of many conversations that ultimately take place at a cultural level, be it politics, movies, or something else entirely. Win Sakdinan<strong>, </strong>Twitter’s Head of Business Marketing for North America, explains, “Twitter is the home for very influential people, people who really want to be in the know….That classic adoption curve – Twitter users are always at the low part, as [trends] start, and then it starts to spread out. When you reach these individuals, whether you’re a brand or an individual talking about a certain topic, it spreads fast to other channels. It gets onto the news, goes to Instagram, to Facebook, to Clubhouse, to TED Talks, and everything.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, discussions and trends emerging organically on social media are not a new phenomenon. The trick is how to leverage those conversations.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Social Media Leads to More Casual, Authentic Interactions</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Compared to the traditional ad-buy model where brands strictly control the message they disseminate to the world, social media is much more interactive – which lends it responsiveness and “realness” not found in other media. In fact, a tradeoff exists here: some marketing messages are glossy, tightly controlled, and on-message, while others are more casual and down to earth – and that authenticity means relinquishing some control.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In fact, controlling your message is antithetical to organic growth. For some brands, that’s OK – traditional advertising is still an option. But for brands pursuing more organic reach through social, you can only hope to contribute to a larger conversation, not to control it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Public chat network Clubhouse is one example of a platform where brand messaging must take a backseat, Berk says. “Creating a strategy that will work [on Clubhouse is something] that you can’t really plan for. You can create the bones of a strategy, but you can’t plan the content like you would on other social networks.” For his agency, which works with brands on a consulting basis, this can mean some difficult conversations about whether social is really where they want to focus. “We always ask our clients, would you share this with your friend? Would you send this over to your mom? And if the answer’s no, the question is, why are you doing it, and is social the right place for it?” Berk advises brands to ask, “‘Do you really want an organic social strategy?’ Everyone says they do. They’re like, ‘Well, I want 100 million followers and I want all these impressions and I want people to love us.’ It’s like, OK, then you can’t put your brand first. You have to participate in a conversation.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But for Pamela Saunders, Public Relations &amp; Social Impact Lead at Microsoft, organic growth isn’t about going viral: “Everybody knows who Microsoft is. I don’t need to build a brand – I’m coming at it from a very different perspective. What I learned pretty quickly was that we needed to demystify who we are as a company – what does it mean to people locally? What does it mean to companies locally? Who wants to work with us, with an understanding of what we really stand for? And we found social was a really great place to talk about that. We were able to profile employees. We were able to showcase the kinds of things that we do within our walls, the kinds of work that we do in a really grassroots sort of way….I have the opportunity to be separate from the brand side, where the communications have to be that slick, really pretty photography and video that big brands are known for.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Saunders’s goals at Microsoft are more focused on building relationships over the long term. “For us, success is really when somebody applies for a job here,” she says, “and what they tell us is, ‘I’ve been watching the videos, I’ve been seeing the content, and  I’m really interested in this team because I feel like they align with the kinds of things I want to do.’ That’s where I’m measuring it….Maybe they didn’t share our videos because it wasn’t that type of content, but it really resonated and stuck in their head. That’s super successful for me.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The COVID-19 Pandemic Changed the Landscape</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Henry explains, many brands that reach users by being authentic and approachable got a boost in 2020. “One of the truths of the pandemic is that, in order to be together safely someday, for a while, we had to figure out how to be together apart. Social media stepped in to fill that void for so many people….It’s been amazing to see how, a little more than a year ago, everything was focused on hyper-productivity and consumption, and now it’s all about mental health and well-being. [As a result,] there’s a lot more realness to what the platforms have. And I think that going forward, that is what brands are going to have to adopt. They’re going to have to learn to speak to people on the level that they’re at, rather than having it be like that glossy ad trying to advertise to you.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Saunders echoes Henry’s sentiments: “There was a focus on video a couple of years ago when…we were all building video teams, trying to figure out how to manage it and stay true to the vision that our brands had always had about producing video – really nice looking stuff. Those platforms started to change the way that people were interacting with video. And what we’ve seen over the pandemic is a real lean in to that. We don’t see as much heavily produced content. It’s about being a little bit messy because we’ve all been trapped in our houses and trying to share things and be real because we can’t connect in real life. That has shifted the way we think about using social, and I don’t see us ever going back.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If we can’t go back, how do we go forward? “How do brands shift again, and make it more about providing value as people come out of their cocoons and do things, versus providing value for people while they’re on lockdown?” Berk says. “Now the challenge is, how do brands provide that value to communities and individuals that are not stuck inside anymore, and want to start having experiences again?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This speaks directly to the challenge of maintaining social media’s influence throughout more of the marketing funnel during the pandemic – not just creating awareness, but also providing seamless entry into shopping and even point-of-sale. “Part of [the pandemic-driven shift to social] was that I couldn’t go out and shop the way I used to,” Saunders says. “And I started adapting what my expectations were….One of the things that I’ve seen – and I think this is a shift that you’ll see brands really navigating over the coming year – is we’re all starting to move outside again. But a lot of us have established online shopping or online routines that I think will continue….I want the same kind of closeness that I felt to some of the brands that I’ve been shopping with over the last year….I want that frictionless [experience], I want to go from great content right into the store to buy the thing.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This brings us back to the question of how to leverage conversations playing out online to build organic reach. Using data to meet users where they are and engage with them in a less rigid, more authentic way are two important strategies; another strategy comes down to timing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Seize the Moment</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Social media is driven by conversations, trends, and other content that tends to occur in cycles – meaning it’s a clean slate every day. To get in on that conversation means being flexible and ready to move when an opportunity appears. That being said, not every social media event is an opportunity for marketing; brands have been burned in the past by trying to capitalize on tragedy, simply because the topic was trending. There’s a time and place for brands to add their voice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At Twitter, 2020 was a good example of how challenging that can be. Between the pandemic, the first anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the attack on Capitol Hill, 2020 was a banner year for driving user engagement at Twitter – but none of these events made for a good branding moment – meaning brands had to learn how to co-exist in the same space as these discussions, even though, in most cases, direct participation in them was not appropriate. So even while engagement was up, Win says, “advertising spend dropped dramatically during the start COVID. People weren’t going to be receptive to brand messages. [Over time,] things got a little bit better, and you realized people still need to brush their teeth and drive cars and watch movies and everything. So things came back.” Still, these newsworthy events never stop happening.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One solution, then, is to initiate a conversation. Win uses the example of McDonald’s launching a new Big Mac, this one with bacon. They could simply shout the message, paying for advertising to raise awareness. But for organic reach, McDonald’s could also begin a conversation. “Big Mac with bacon – is it still a Big Mac?” Win says. This leads to debate, which grows reach organically while still keeping the conversation on track to meet the brand’s objective. “When you’re driving conversation, there’s an art and science to it that we’re starting to crack that drives more brand relevance, drives more reach and frequency and organic, and it impacts your purchase funnel, ultimately. But it’s getting that sweet spot.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Berk, opportunity lurks in existing conversations that are brand-adjacent – not making the conversation about the brand itself, but using the moment to introduce yourself. This is especially true of platforms like Clubhouse, where centering the brand is especially frowned upon. Instead, find a topic that’s brand-adjacent and contribute something that’s valuable to users. In the case of the new Big Mac, Berk explains how such a strategy could play out on Clubhouse: “Clubhouse is not a place for McDonald’s to exist, but it could be a place where the chef that helped create the Big Mac with bacon could say, ‘Hey everyone, I created the Big Mac with bacon and it is absolutely a Big Mac.’ People would say you’re sharing something really interesting, and you’re an authority on this, and that’s going to bring people into that room and start a massive conversation. So I think there is a tremendous opportunity for brands on Clubhouse, especially because there’s a lot of white space there.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Henry gives another example of a brand seizing a moment that arose organically on TikTok. “Earlier this week, I got an email from a bookstore chain [with] a series of books that were trending on #BookTok” – a hashtag used by TikTok’s book-loving community, one that has put books on the bestseller list years after they were released. “I’m obsessed with #BookTok, so I instantly clicked on it to see what books they were selecting. I already owned a bunch of them, and I ended up buying a few more. This is an excellent example of a brand capitalizing on a moment where media and culture met in a way that was relevant to their brand without waiting for their particular brand to be mentioned. Because, in the digital space, we always have to have our ears to the ground to be able to strategically pinpoint moments of relevance for our brand. It doesn’t have to be that our brand is specifically being mentioned, but it could be something in the zeitgeist that is relevant to our brand.” </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Henry, a successful campaign is one that “people found valuable and engaged with in a way so that they shared it, in addition to us having paid media behind it. I come to all of my social media campaigns with a single North Star, and that begins and ends with the audience.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cover letters, resumes, and networking are an important part of the job application process. But to really stand out and show off your skills, there’s another tool that every digital marketing professional should add to their job search toolkit: the portfolio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To help you create a digital marketing portfolio, we asked BrainStation Instructor and Shopify Social Media Producer Francesca Saraco some questions about digital marketing portfolios.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here’s why you need a digital marketing portfolio – even if you don’t have work experience – and how to create one that will help you stand out in the job market.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Why Do You Need a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whether you’re looking for a job or you love your job, it’s never a bad idea to have a digital marketing portfolio on the go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“It’s important to have a showcase of your work because you never know when you’ll be asked for it,” says Saraco. “Showcasing your work helps you be discovered by potential employers. Plus, it’s nice to see how far you’ve come, how much you’ve grown and the different trajectories your work has taken.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Keeping an up-to-date portfolio shows that you’re dedicated and engaged, and could lead to new connections or even job offers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>What Is in a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s easy to guess what kind of work a Writer, Designer, or Web Developer might showcase in their portfolio. But when it comes to a digital marketing portfolio, the content might be less obvious. That’s because digital marketing often involves teamwork, strategic thinking, and planning that can’t always be captured in a writing sample or image.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Sometimes people in more strategy-driven roles are more challenged with what they can put in a portfolio because their work is thinking based,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The solution, says Saraco, is to show a tangible product, credit the team you worked with, and then explain what your role was.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example, you could feature a few photos from an Instagram campaign with a caption that describes your role: Did you develop the strategic plan? Write the copy? Coordinate the digital ad buy? Explain your role and how you contributed to the results. Sharing analytics information alongside visuals is another way to highlight your skills (especially for search engine marketing or search engine optimization projects), but be sure you can back up what your role was and how you contributed to success.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>What Do I Include in My Portfolio If I Don’t Have Digital Marketing Experience?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you don’t have any digital marketing work experience, you can still start making a portfolio. Focus first on personal projects and social media profiles, which can be a way to showcase your digital marketing skills and sensibilities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“You can showcase your own content, whether that’s an email newsletter that you write biweekly, or a strong Twitter presence or Instagram presence. That can be shown off in a portfolio to show potential employers how you think and how you create,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you prefer to keep your personal profiles private, consider starting a passion project (like an Instagram or blog dedicated to houseplants or cooking) and featuring it on your portfolio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Digital marketing courses can help in this area, as many will allow you to complete work in a number of areas.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Projects from school are a great portfolio piece to show your thinking process and skills,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Can I Feature Client Work on My Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you do have digital marketing work experience, you might be wondering if it’s okay to feature client work in your portfolio. To avoid any issues, it’s important to ask first.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Simply emailing and asking for consent goes a long way. This is something you can do as your exiting a job or internship, or when a project is complete,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When featuring client work Saraco also emphasizes the importance of crediting others who worked on the project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Don’t take credit for content that’s not yours, that’s really important. There is no shame in crediting collaborators on a project. It shows that you can work on a team,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How Do I Start Making a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To start making a digital marketing portfolio, you’ll want to first find a portfolio website to help you organize and showcase your work. There are currently a wide range of free or relatively cost-effective websites that offer ready-made or customizable templates for online portfolios. Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly are just a few of the options available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember that the portfolio itself becomes an example of your work, so it’s important to choose a platform that you’re comfortable using.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Keep it nice and organized, create a nice user experience and show off your personality,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once your portfolio is ready to go, make it easy to find by adding a link in your resume, on your LinkedIn page, and your social media accounts.</p>

<p>Chiantelle Nicole is a Registered Holistic Nutritionist, a Certified Wedding Planner, and the founder of Chia’s Eats, a nutrition community and consulting service. After a medical scare in 2011, Nicole sought alternatives to the laundry list of medications she was prescribed. Her health journey led her to start her career as a Nutritionist and consultant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A big part of me wanted to try an alternative, and that’s when I turned to food. I love food already (I call myself a professional taste tester) and so I wanted to learn more about how to use it therapeutically.”</p>



<p>As Nicole looked to grow her business, she quickly understood that social media marketing is a big piece in establishing a brand and building a community. We spoke with Nicole to learn how she’s used social media to grow her brand presence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Building Community </h2>



<p>Nicole took BrainStation’s Social Media Marketing course to find new ways to meet potential clients, community members, and partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Social media is such a powerful tool and a great way to build a community all over the world. I actually met a lot of people through social media before meeting them in person. Even though I had a good foundation of how to utilize social media personally and professionally, I wanted to dig deeper to learn more about optimizing it especially because there’s always something new to learn.”</p>



<p>Nicole relies on channels like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest to display her food and event content, and the Social Media Marketing course showed her the benefit of truly understanding your audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Once you have that foundation, the application of a social media strategy and successful campaigns becomes so much easier,” she shared. “This course also reminded me of how important and powerful language and visuals can become, especially when you’re wanting to convert strangers to followers to clients in actually purchasing your product or service.”</p>



<h2>A Strong Brand Presence</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jgcWSabHqtcCUHE4HfstLaWCWnQctMA6x_CPbbFCKBxzJsVcZBbMcUl6XFUO3okOcPLv7TfBGr7w1MCOiE0qXpco2NTp_8so7qLxGjhXerhurC1Vv1EflyKzq3upLilARSqrg9QT" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A big part of developing your social media and online presence is to have a recognizable brand aesthetic. For Nicole, that meant a classic, clean look that focused on storytelling and learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When people go to Chia’s Eats, I want them to feel happy, excited, and eager to know more about food and nutrition. I want people to know where their food is coming from and make them feel inspired to try new things.”</p>



<p>The more she learns, the more her strategy has adapted to master the social channels that work best for her brand.</p>



<p>“Since taking the course, my marketing strategy has changed to focus more on specializing in one-to-two specific platforms at a time rather than constantly creating content everywhere. It can get super overwhelming especially with all the new features, and by doing this, it has allowed me to build a stronger community and generate good quality leads.”</p>



<p>After implementing some of the strategy she learned, Nicole shared that she’s increased her following on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chiaseats/?hl=en">@chiaseats</a> by 85 percent, her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chiantelle/?hl=en">personal following</a> by 95.5 percent, and her <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/chiantellenicole/">Pinterest</a> views by 48.2 percent!</p>



<p>For Nicole, the biggest challenge was deciding on a specific direction that would set her apart from the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Learning how I could stand out and bring in my own offering was a challenge. However, the relationships and connections I made have really helped, and I would say that is key to my successes in marketing my brand. Second would be having a clear marketing plan and an ideal audience to speak to. Understanding what I was offering and investing in relationships &#8230; made a huge difference.”</p>



<p>Her advice to fellow entrepreneurs? Take it one step at a time. “It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the avenues and all the features,” she said, “but try them out anyway to see what works best for you, your services, and your audience. Ask for help and keep investing in you.”</p>



<h2>A Foundation of Learning&nbsp;</h2>



<p>BrainStation’s Social Media course was a great way for Nicole to dive into social media on a deeper level and apply new concepts to her marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The highlight from my BrainStation learning experience would be in the real life examples from our instructor, Julie. It’s one thing to learn concepts and foundations, and it’s a whole other level applying it to something more tangible,” she said, adding that she expects to keep learning –&nbsp;life-long learning, after all, is at the heart of her business venture.</p>

<p>“Chia’s Eats is more than just sharing what I eat. It’s an online platform that focuses on community, education, and fun. I utilize this platform to share more about supporting local businesses, easy and healthy recipes, nutritional information, what’s in season in farmer’s markets, sustainability, and tips on how to live a more intentional and holistic lifestyle.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <strong>How Brands are Winning on TikTok</strong> panel discussion, the latest in <a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online">BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a>, took place on July 22nd, and thousands of professionals tuned in to learn how leading brands have adopted the world’s fastest-growing social media platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/440998240" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>In Q1 of 2020, TikTok was downloaded more than 315 million times worldwide, which is the best quarter ever recorded by any app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform is known for its unique style of video – including dancing and voiceover comedy – and has become a key channel for digital marketers to reach Gen Z customers. Much of its growth is down to its simplicity – it is arguably the easiest social media platform to use when it comes to video editing, using music, and adding filters – and the fact that’s impossible to put down; TikTok’s algorithms quickly learn user preferences by capturing likes, comments, and time spent on each video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as with any new social media platform, there is a steep learning curve for brands hoping to create content that feels natural and engages users. And when attempting to connect with the most media-savvy generation in history, this can be trickier than ever before.</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways leading brands are building their brand on TikTok.</p>



<h2>Create for TikTok</h2>



<p>Chipotle was the first restaurant to partner with TikTok in the U.S., and the brand has been praised for its use of the platform through campaigns like the #GuacChallenge and #ChipotleLidFlip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latter was a “challenge” that asked TikTok fans to dance to a song by Dr. Jean about guacamole. The campaign was successful because it felt organic and natural to the platform, mixing music, dancing, pop culture, and a sense of silliness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We were the first restaurant brand to do a hashtag challenge, and 59 thousand people ended up doing the lid flip,” said Candice Beck, Senior Manager, Social and Digital Marketing at Chipotle, explaining that the brand has also run TikTok-specific campaigns on National Burrito Day, among others. “We often find pretty big success when we can align a brand moment with a cultural moment like that,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chipotle’s efforts have paid off; they now have more than 800 thousand followers and 11 million likes on TikTok.</p>



<p>“We get so much more engagement on TikTok than other social channels. It’s by far a priority channel for us,” said Beck, explaining that her team has daily 15-minute meetings to discuss content for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are really coming to TikTok right now for happy content. I go there to get some of that uplighting, fun, user content that’s been necessary to bring a bit of joy recently&#8230;we’re using our channels pretty similarly. We’re not using organic presence for PR so much, even driving new products. We’re taking insights that we’ve learned from the platform itself and applying that every time we share a new piece of content.”</p>



<p>Jason Berk, Head of Social and Digital at Sid Lee, believes this is the best approach when it comes to developing a content strategy for TikTok.</p>



<p>“What I constantly tell [clients] is you cannot repurpose your content from other platforms on TikTok. Not only will not work; it’ll backfire. It needs to be quick, relevant content as well. There needs to be a willingness to move fast,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Understand What TikTok Is</h2>



<p>You might think TikTok is nothing but teenage girls lip-syncing in their rooms, but according to Berk, you would be mistaken.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tiktok is not a singular platform with a reputation, it’s a lot of different communities and a lot of different people talking in a lot of different ways&#8230;I think that’s the reason why it’s become this de-facto trend factory. Once something goes big in a community, it catches fire and everyone supports that,” Berk said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaleb Ruel, Head of US Consumer Marketing at Spotify, explains that this trend-setting ability makes TikTok stand out from other media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“TikTok is a place where we go to participate in that cultural narrative, and success looks a lot different in that sense. We’re not looking at the same media metrics and bottom line impact on the business,” he said, adding that Spotify has seen success mixing organic and paid media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The biggest lesson for us is that when you have a TikTok challenge alone it’s fantastic, but when you have a challenge that’s coupled with other harder driving media, like larger ad placements that are more marquee, that’s when we see the highest impact.”</p>



<h2>Focus on Authenticity&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Another way TikTok has stood out from the crowd is for the supposed “realness” of its content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Instagram is hyper-filtered and the content that brands partner with there tends to be as well. TikTok tends to be the complete opposite. I’d say authentic and raw are common terms that I hear,” Ruel said.</p>



<p>Berk agrees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of realness on TikTok – like the LGTBT community coming out and talking about their stories. That creates solidarity and it’s a little more serious, it unites a community,” he said, adding that this creates an unvarnished, safe place. “On Instagram you have to look your best, you have to be the prettiest, you have to be the envy of your circle of friends. On TikTok, it’s a little safer to show some of your fears and concerns and losses and some of these universal emotions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>TikTok may, therefore, feel riskier than other platforms from a brand’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think every brand belongs on TikTok. I think you really have to know your brand ethos and what you stand for and how you stand for it. The ones that do a good job are unapologetic about being there,” Ruel said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most successful brands on TikTok are also vigilant about keeping up with trends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The team is constantly mining for UGC about Chipotle, new trends, new insights, specifically on TikTok&#8230;we’re looking for any new posts from other users that we can comment on or anything we should repost or a trend we should consider. So, we’re in deep,” Beck said, adding that this shouldn’t scare brands away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Get on there experiment, see what your followers like. [&#8230;] Don’t be intimidated by creating the perfect video; we’ve found a lot of success with some of our comments on other people&#8217;s posts about Chipotle. It’s not about creating the perfect TikTok that meets Gen Z’s liking.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Berk, it all comes down to remembering what you’re trying to do: make videos to connect and have some fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Make the channels and start putting videos out. A lot of people on my team have become pseudo influencers&#8230;It doesn’t cost a lot to make these kinds of videos, so I would say just do it.” <br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Stop Advertising. Start Inspiring. That was Azadeh Attar&#8217;s message at <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-we-learned-at-social-media-week-toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Media Week</a>, and as the Head of Partnerships at Pinterest, she&#8217;s well acquainted with awe-inspiring content. During her talk, she encouraged marketers to remember the top of the funnel by delighting audiences with engaging content.</p>



<p>Eager to learn more, we spoke with Attar about her role as Head of Partnerships, the trick to building a creative campaign, and how companies can leverage Pinterest to inspire their audiences.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Azadeh-Attar-Headshot-Pinterest.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Azadeh-Attar-Headshot-Pinterest.jpg" alt="Headshot of Azadeh Attar" class="wp-image-10441" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Azadeh-Attar-Headshot-Pinterest.jpg 200w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Azadeh-Attar-Headshot-Pinterest-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Azadeh-Attar-Headshot-Pinterest-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Azadeh-Attar-Headshot-Pinterest-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption>Azadeh Attar, Head of Partnerships at Pinterest</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><b>What does a typical day look like for you as Head of Partnerships at Pinterest?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My days are an energizing mix of working with our advertising partners and collaborating with our internal teams around the world. My work with our partners focuses on helping them achieve their business objectives using Pinterest. We’re continuing to introduce new ways for advertisers to get their products in front of Pinterest users while also making the platform more shoppable. My day could include presenting to a marketing team or agency about Pinterest, running a creative best practice session, or collaborating with our partners on a big campaign idea. I also spend time each day working with cross-functional partners at Pinterest to help inform the next set of products and tools that will help our advertisers succeed. It’s really exciting to be able to help shape the products we’re building and collaborate across a wide cross-section of offerings like measurement, analytics, creative and marketing.</span></p>



<p><b>You have an impressive background! How did your experience at Google influence the way you approach marketing and partnerships today?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the values I admire greatly at Google is that of putting the user first and all else will follow. It made the priority clear and the motive empowering.&nbsp; It’s also one of Pinterest’s values – putting the Pinner first – in fact, the user is at the core of our mission: bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://business.pinterest.com/en/blog/100-pinterest-trends-for-2019"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-pinterest-100-blog-wellness.jpg" alt="visual representation of wellness showing berries, leaves, weights, elixirs, and other wellness items" class="wp-image-10445" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-pinterest-100-blog-wellness.jpg 888w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-pinterest-100-blog-wellness-300x216.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019-pinterest-100-blog-wellness-768x552.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" /></a><figcaption>Health and Wellness was one of the top 100 Pinterest trends in 2019.

<p><b>Climbing to the top of your field can be all-consuming, and many leaders struggle to manage the time they dedicate to their career and the time dedicated to their personal wellness. As an executive, how have you found that balance?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m still working on this and striving to find balance, but for me, I’ve realized that having a <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-female-tech-trailblazers-who-are-changing-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supportive manager</a> and strong accountable team is key.&nbsp; I work hard, but I also spend time taking care of my family and doing the things that are important for me to live a full and happy life. Our team supports each other in this which has had an immensely positive impact on my life. At Pinterest, we’re passionate about the work we do, and we also recognize that it’s important to do things like cook, travel, garden, run, and build. We also greatly value <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/diversity-in-leadership-building-a-culture-for-women-to-succeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversity and inclusion</a> and the company has many family-friendly benefits and practices that allow parents to thrive.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>At Social Media Week, you mentioned you’re excited to work for Pinterest because you align well with their values. What are some of Pinterest’s core values? And what values do you think tech giants as a whole should uphold?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest has a few core values and one of my favorites is &#8220;Put Pinners First.&#8221; Our company is always thinking about how they can make Pinterest an inspiring and positive place to help people create a life they love.&nbsp; A great example of this in action is in preventing the spread of misinformation about vaccination. Last year, Pinterest took the step to only show Pins from trusted sources such as the American Association of Pediatrics when someone searches for information about vaccination.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>I imagine as Head of Partnerships, a big part of your role is building relationships with other companies. What are you looking for in a B2B partner? And what makes for a good B2B partnership?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things I love about Pinterest is that brands are additive to the platform – they actually enhance the user experience because they provide utility and add value to the user.&nbsp; Brands want to matter, to be relevant, to be of value, and that is exactly what Pinterest allows them to achieve. People come to Pinterest with the intent to plan for something in their future, a dream vacation, a home renovation, a work outfit, or a new skincare routine, and brands are what helps people bring those moments, those ideas to life. As such, brands are inherently useful on the platform, not an interruption. It’s so refreshing to be able to partner with brands in this way and help them discover ways to inspire their customers. I love partnering with brands that are eager to connect to their audiences in this way.&nbsp;</span></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mobile-home-feed.jpg"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mobile-home-feed-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10444" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mobile-home-feed-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mobile-home-feed-200x300.jpg 200w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mobile-home-feed-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mobile-home-feed-960x1440.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></a></figure></div>



<p><b>What kind of content do you suggest for <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/blue-ant-plus-on-how-to-engage-ad-resistant-eyeballs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad-resistant eyeballs</a>? Is there a campaign you’ve seen that you think was especially effective?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People come to Pinterest when they are planning for things in their lives from big projects to small life moments like what to cook for dinner or a new beauty look to try.&nbsp; And, businesses can turn users into customers through compelling and visually informative ads that are created specifically for the platform.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we recently conducted a study of Pinterest users to ask what makes ads inspiring. Analyzing their feedback and responses determined that for Pinners, ads are inspiring when they have two or more of the following attributes: positivity, visual-appeal, novelty, and are attainable and actionable. The dimension here that stands out for me is ‘positivity.’ People really respond to uplifting, ads that inspire rather than interrupt. We’re all looking for more positivity in our lives, we’re looking for encouragement and empowerment.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of this is a recent </span><a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/71283606590715740/?lp=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sportchek video</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s running in January that’s all about encouraging and empowering people to achieve their 2020 goals.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b>A few top tips for creative ads on Pinterest:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>



<ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands are additive on Pinterest, where people are seeking inspiration and ideas. Successful creative ads on Pinterest are a reflection of this mindset, offering solutions through visually appealing, actionable, and most of all inspiring content.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Branded creative should move people on Pinterest from “discovery” to “do.” Encourage people to think or do something new through visuals and interesting copy, from simple call-to-action headlines right through to step-by-step tutorials.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be brand proud and ensure your logo is clearly visible.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap into moments, trends and interests to create ads specifically for Pinterest, even when you are repurposing assets from other channels.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan ahead for Pinterest, leveraging and trusting the insights to inform content strategy, concepts, and asset development. Remember people plan on Pinterest up to 3 months in advance, so think about launching your campaign earlier to catch your audience.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top attributes we see in inspiring creative are: originality, positivity, actionable, attainable and visually appealing. Use as many you feel work. Most of all, they’re a helpful reminder of the mindset on the platform.</span></li></ul>



<p><b>One thing that differentiates Pinterest from other platforms is that it’s more directly linked to the “real world.”People are saving pins as inspiration for “real life.” How do you think that makes your message different from other image-based platforms?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinners have high intent. They use Pinterest to help them make things happen in real life. So, we’re focused on helping take our users from inspiration to action.&nbsp; That means creating an inspiring space where you can think about yourself and your future, free from judgment, and where you can see recommendations tailored specifically to your interests and your tastes that allow you to take action.</span></p>



<p><b>Do you have any creative examples of ways traditional industries (for example, banking, healthcare, education) have been able to grab attention online on Pinterest or otherwise?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve seen some great work from traditional banks. One example is</span> <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/AeNqimXkG1wmZMc7pMWOEkypExbjAGHrXWPiwImmThK3_BmVzhZlsRRq2fRFjmB0JTEg6UD1FL684XNODBK5vFY/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scotiabank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They have a clear and simple message about energizing your investments in 2020.&nbsp; The team built off the insight that Q1 is the biggest moment of the year where Pinners are thinking about their investments and financial goals for the year ahead.&nbsp; Activating against key consumer moments is a winning strategy on Pinterest. Creative that aligns to a specific consumer moment performs very well and sees higher engagement.</span></p>

<p><b>What advice do you have for marketers starting to build out an ads funnel? Where can they start and what are some key things they should keep in mind?&nbsp;</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to win with consumers is to reach them early, before they’ve made up their mind about what they want and who they want to buy it from. Pinterest is the ideal place to reach people discover your brand early on because they come to the platform to consider future activities and purchases.&nbsp; For instance, People use Pinterest to plan and search for holiday content two times earlier than on other platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the first thing would be to consider launching your ad campaign earlier on Pinterest than other platforms to take advantage of this early planning mindset.&nbsp; After that, it’s about leveraging the right ad solutions to help them along the purchase funnel. Our new shopping ad format, for example, allows brands to seamlessly connect with users who are ready to purchase.</span></p>



<p><b>What skills do you think are most important for today and tomorrow&#8217;s workforce in marketing and beyond.</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, one of the most important skills that drives success is the ability to get a team or an organization to adapt and change very quickly.&nbsp; Consumer behavior is changing so quickly today, driven by the pace of technological innovation. As a Marketer, it’s critical to be able to get your team to stay on top of and evolve alongside your consumers and technologies that shape their lives.&nbsp; I’ve heard that referred to as agility, and it’s a combination of having the latest knowledge, being open to change, and setting the culture and operational structure where people can make decisions and act quickly.</span></p>



<p><b>What does the future have in store for Pinterest?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll continue to focus on our mission of bringing everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.&nbsp; Our Pinners can expect more ways to take action on and shop for the ideas they discover. We believe the future of shopping will be about both discovery and personalization &#8211; two aspects we’ve always prioritized on the platform. People on Pinterest are planners and come to the platform to find trends, styles, and looks as a way to figure out their preferences. No other platform enables such a symbiotic relationship between consumers and brands and we’re looking forward to rolling out more ways to make shopping even easier on Pinterest in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Week (SMW) 2019 held its Toronto conference last week, and the global event brought together a wide range of marketing professionals and experts. Attendees were eager to explore the impact of social media on the digital and social landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the four-day conference, one theme was abundantly clear: Be authentic! </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smw2.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10059 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smw2.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smw2.jpeg 680w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smw2-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve heard this message before, but despite these warnings, it’s easy for Marketers to fall into the trap of producing conversion-centric content. Panelists shared their advice for creating value-based ads that both engage and inspire. They also discussed the importance of creating authentic relationships with your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at some of the things we learned at SMW 2019.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Value-Based) Content is King</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jeff Goldnebert of Abacus Agency put it, “you can’t out-perform bad creative.” The experts and panelists from SMW repeatedly reminded us that noteworthy advertising content tends to be values-based (in that it says something about the company’s greater ethos), with campaigns that tell a relatable story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to setting standards for content production, both Blue Ant Plus and Pinterest had similar filters with which to gauge the quality of their content. </span></p>
<p><b>Blue Ant Plus aims to produce content that is: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filled with tension</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pinterest content aims to be: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beautiful</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Novel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attainable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, both companies stress the importance of producing attention-grabbing ads that tap into people’s real emotions with inspiring, authentic stories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Ant Plus brought up iconic examples like Nike and Patagonia that tug on heartstrings. Or, as Pinterest likes to say, inspires rather than interrupts. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwnike.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10060 size-full" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwnike-e1574112364240.jpg" alt="Nike Ad: Believe in something.

<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-10061 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia-1024x576.jpg" alt="Patagonia Ad: Why Patagonia is Fighting for Public Lands: two people look over at national monument" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/smwpatagonia.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rise of the Micro-Influencer</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Bartlett, the CEO of Social Chain, A media company and agency, reiterated the importance of inspirational content with a cautionary tale about influencer marketing. Their agency’s research illustrated the vast number of influencer accounts propped up by fake followers; inconsistent influencers who will promote whatever they’re paid to share; and celebrities who are bulking up their like counts with fake accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no wonder trust is on the decline. Bartlett then further illustrated the point, revealing that a large portion of his conent engagement comes from his podcast diary. Why? Because he’s revealing his true self. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sarah Feldman of Endy also emphasized the importance of finding authentic ambassadors. Endy ensures that their ambassadors have used their product and genuinely improved their sleep because of it, which gives their work for the company a layer of believability and trust, ultimately helping the company develop long-term relationships with its customers. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10064 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden-1024x576.jpg" alt="Endy mattress ad Jann Arden laying on mattress" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden-960x540.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/endyjannarden.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To capture some of that authenticity, companies have started focusing on “micro-influencers,” or as Neil Mohan, the Creative Agency Partner at Facebook Canada calls them, “creators.” Micro-influencers have between 1,000 to 1,000,000 followers and are often interested in a specific niche (think foodies, travel junkies, fashionistas, and fitness fanatics). This specialization tends to lead to a deeper, more personal connection with their audiences, with higher engagement. In fact, research has shown that influencers with 1,000 followers generated 85 percent higher engagement than those with 100,000 followers. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engagement Has to Be Real</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with your customers should be real as well. Who hasn’t had a frustrating experience with a bot? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toronto-based jewelry brand Mejuri was insistent that they create real relationships with their Instagram community. Their social team is made up of members that are actively engaged with and listening to the community to ensure that their interactions come across as genuine. They also don’t want to miss any crucial opportunities for personal interaction or engagement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carre Ohem, Social Media Manager from The Gist echoed this sentiment and suggested a series of questions that can help you figure out if your social content will have the kind of reaction you’re looking for. Does the post make you feel something when you’re creating it? Is it funny, sad, or relevant? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not, question why you’re posting it and whether it will elicit a real response from your audience. </span></p>

I also hold a certificate in Media &amp; Communication Fundamentals from Seneca College, and recently completed a Marketing certificate at George Brown College in addition to the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/social-media-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Marketing Certificate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from BrainStation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of my career, I’ve been working at TELUS for 11 years – I started in 2008 where I was hired as a Sales Representative selling cell phones and plans in my local mall, and did that for over 5 years to financially put myself through University. In my last semester of University, I was required to do an internship, which I completed on the Marketing Communications team that I’m still on today. I’ve grown from an Intern, to a Specialist, to a Manager, to a Senior Manager within 5 years. I’ve definitely had the authentic “climbing the corporate ladder” experience.</span></p>
<p><b>What does your day-to-day look like as the Senior Marketing Communications Manager, CRM at TELUS?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two days are the same within my role, and that’s how I like it! Depending on the day I could be spending hours in back-to-back in-person meetings at the TELUS office, on conference calls at home, sifting through emails on the train, or writing briefs out of the Marketing agency – it really depends. I’m very grateful for the flexible work style that my team is offered as it allows me to do my best work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I specialize in crafting marketing communications for TELUS’ existing customer base and work closely with our main Marketing agency, The Greenhouse, throughout the creative direction and development process. At any given time, I manage up to 20 integrated marketing campaigns simultaneously from briefing, to execution, to post-mortem for my respective portfolios.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the core elements and channels of your digital marketing strategy at TELUS?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core channels I leverage for the marketing campaigns I manage targeting TELUS’ existing customer base are Facebook, Instagram, IAB (Interactive Ad Banners), and GSP (Google Sponsored Promotions).</span></p>
<p><b>You’ve worked on the Marketing Communications team at TELUS for more than five years, how have you seen the strategy or marketing efforts change with the rise of digital technology?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I started as an Intern in 2014, TELUS’ marketing communications strategy has changed significantly. Back then, it was common for my team to create physical addressed mail pieces promoting TELUS’ products and services, and send them directly to customers – I remember spending hours learning about different types of paper stocks and finishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, my team has shifted our efforts to primarily digital-focused campaigns, and that’s allowed us to meet and exceed our engagement and conversion expectations. We’ve tested, failed fast, and innovated to remain competitive within the space and ensure we’re delivering the right message, to the right person, at the right time, in the right medium.</span></p>
<p><b>What role has professional development and learning played throughout your career journey so far?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional development and learning has played a pivotal role throughout my career journey, and I’m a passionate lifelong learner that’s dedicated to being enrolled in at least 1 course per year. TELUS is an organization that’s incredibly supportive of team members’ professional development and success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I used a combination of in-store sales experience and self-taught marketing knowledge to get my foot in the door in the field, consistently and intentionally keeping my skills up-to-date with courses and bootcamps completed outside of my day job has undoubtedly contributed to my growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as I’ve spent my entire career thus far working within the same company, it’s important for me to learn from industry professionals in different fields to gain different perspectives and expose myself to new ways of problem solving. I’ve been taught by professors who work in everything from finance, to CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods), to e-commerce, to boutique marketing agencies and everything in between – and it’s truly helped diversify the way I develop creative solutions within my role.</span></p>
<p><b>You have an extensive background in marketing and communications, and you’re no stranger to the marketing world, so what drove you to take the BrainStation Social Media Marketing Course?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TELUS is a very large organization that has many different teams with various specializations. My team, which specializes in overall Customer Communications, collaborates with the highly skilled Digital and Social Media Marketing team to ensure we’re delivering quality communications to our existing customer base. I believe that in order to have the best possible outcomes in this collaborative effort, it’s imperative for me to have a thorough understanding of the foundation of the digital and social media marketing world, to be able to provide them with the tools they need to help facilitate a successful campaign. I took the BrainStation course to be able to play my part in ensuring our teams are developing quality, engaging campaigns as efficiently as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I started doing my research for what organization to take a Social Media Marketing course at, BrainStation was recommended on numerous occasions through word of mouth, online searches, and within the tech community.</span></p>
<p><b>In addition to your roles at TELUS, you were the Co-founder and Host of a successful podcast that recently wrapped up, and are now working on a new solo project called Liberty Leave. Can you tell us more about these?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damsel in the 6ix was a podcast I co-hosted that encouraged women to effortlessly slay life and focused on career navigation, self-development, and dating in Toronto. It was featured on BlogTO’s “Top Toronto Podcasts You Should Be Listening To” article, and included podcast guests from companies like Bumble, Plan International Canada, NKPR, and more. After over 12K listens and 62 episodes, my co-host and I have officially closed the chapter and are exploring new opportunities after an incredibly fulfilling experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new project I’m currently working on is called Liberty Leave and will focus on inspiring people who are making purposeful pivots in life and have left behind what doesn’t bring them liberty, for what does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s important for people to develop their own identity that doesn’t solely stand on the legs of their day job. Whether that’s just a strong personal brand, or it also includes a side project that allows you to let your creativity flow and work with brands you may not have the opportunity to in your day job – growing your career and presence doesn’t solely need to be done within the company you work for full-time. </span></p>
<p><b>How are you applying the skills you learned in the Social Media Marketing course to your professional role at TELUS or to your side project?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skills I learned in the Social Media Marketing course have helped me better understand targeting practices and user personas, pinpointing what verbiage has the highest likelihood to resonate with my audience, what layouts and formats drive the most engagement, what platforms tend to have the highest conversion rates for different demographics, and much more that I’m applying to my role at TELUS today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Liberty Leave, I have the opportunity to completely build a brand from scratch, and I’m excited to utilize the skills I learned in the course to create a presence on social. In this day and age, it’s imperative to have a strong social media presence for a company to grow, and I can’t wait to reference my pages and pages of notes from class to build out an acquisition strategy to support my growth stage.</span></p>
<p><b>What was your favourite part of your BrainStation experience?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favourite part about my BrainStation experience was interacting with the community. I had some incredibly bright and ambitious classmates, and it was so inspiring to see how they were utilizing their knowledge from the Social Media Marketing course to help drive results for either an organization they work for, or for an existing or upcoming business they were passionate about developing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also had a great professor that I found very relatable, and she really helped me shape my understanding of where and how to spend on Digital Marketing channels depending on what your desired outcome is, and illustrated her recommendations with real-life examples and commentary.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what kind of product you’re marketing, it’s become a certainty that the audience you need to reach is on social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, 3.196 billion people now use social media, and that number jumped by a million people per day in 2018. Facebook alone now reaches 69 percent of American adults, 1.9 billion users visit YouTube every month, 67 percent of people aged 18 to 29 use Instagram, and Snapchat is used by 73 percent of people age 18-24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And brands that know how to properly leverage those audiences are reaping the reward. Shopify research showed that 80 percent of Instagram users follow at least one brand, 60 percent say they’ve discovered new products or services through the platform, at least 30 percent have purchased products they discovered there, and 65 percent of the top-performing Instagram posts clearly feature products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, businesses understand the value of learning how to tap into that massive audience; investments in social media advertising are forecast to grow to about </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1538/social-media-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$48 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2021 and companies have started <a href="https://www.renderforest.com/blog/ai-for-social-media-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experimenting with AI for social media marketing</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a successful social media campaign requires forethought and careful planning; in fact, a study from CoSchedule found that goal-setting marketers are 376 percent more likely to report success, marketers who document their strategy are 313 percent more likely to report success, and marketers who proactively plan projects are 356 percent more likely to report success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we took a closer look at how to properly plan an effective social media campaign from scratch.</span></p>
<h3><b>Audit Your Current Social Media Presence</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you can launch a killer social media marketing campaign, you’ll need to assess where you stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It probably sounds more onerous than it really is. Essentially, it’s important to take a critical look at all of your company’s social channels, cut or consolidate any extraneous or underused accounts (while centralizing ownership and considering a tool like </span><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LastPass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep track of your passwords), and scan for any imposter accounts impersonating your brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next choose a few key metrics and document the performance of each account somewhere, taking note of which platforms and accounts seem to be generating the most engagement, and again consider shuttering any account that doesn’t seem to have a sufficient following.</span></p>
<h3><b>Determine Your Goals</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motivation behind a social media campaign can vary wildly. Are you looking to increase overall brand awareness, to introduce a new product or service, to create excitement around a limited-time promotion, to reach influencers, or simply to grow your company’s social media following?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://www.hr.virginia.edu/uploads/documents/media/Writing_SMART_Goals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S.M.A.R.T. method</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good starting point – in other words, your goals should be specific (S), measurable (M), attainable (A), relevant (R) and time-bound (T). Define your objectives and key results – or OKRs, an acronym popularized by Google –and consider the metrics that are important to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your goal is awareness, for instance, that can be evaluated through a bevy of metrics, including likes, shares, and impressions, as well as the size of your audience and the reach of your posts. If that’s your goal, a brand-monitoring tool like Hootsuite, BuzzSumo, or Social Mention could be valuable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, if you’re focused on conversions, metrics like bounce rate, click-through rate, and conversion rate will be more important to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefit Cosmetics offers an interesting case study for utilizing different social-media campaigns to achieve specific goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses paid campaigns to raise brand awareness – and indeed, according to Sprout’s 2018 Social Index, increasing brand awareness is the primary goal of 80 percent of business on social media – because only paid social allows insight into awareness lift, whereas the company opts for organic campaigns to achieve acquisition and engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Measuring engagement with paid ads doesn’t tell us what resonates naturally, so we’ve moved away from doing that,” </span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Benefit-Cosmetics-Uses-Organic-vs-Paid-Social/1016793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Assistant Manager of Digital Marketing Janine Nguyen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Observe the Competition</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the same methods you employed to audit your own social media presence to see what competitors in your space are doing, which platforms they’re focusing on, and the strategies that seem to be working and not working.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps to look beyond your industry for inspiration. Facebook provides dozens of </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">success stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for social-media marketing done right and helpfully indexes them by goal type – awareness, consideration and conversion – as well as business size, industry, product type, and region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also find plenty of good ideas combing through the winners and nominees of the annual </span><a href="https://shortyawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shorty Awards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which honor the best in social media and digital.</span></p>
<h3><b>Establish an Editorial Calendar</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An editorial calendar is a crucial tool for content teams of all sizes, which explains why there are so many options on the market (popular choices include Trello, Marketing.Ai, and CoSchedule).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever platform you use, an editorial calendar will help you ensure you don’t miss opportunities relating to awareness days that always generate a ton of social-media interest – International Women’s Day, for instance – and allow you to plot a content mix that makes sense for your brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many marketers are believers in the rule of thirds – so in other words, your social media feed should be fuelled by one-third engagement, one-third curated content, and one-third your own content – while others favor, for instance, a 3-2-5 ratio with three parts your brand voice, two parts a brand representative, and five parts generated by others. It’s an important decision; </span><a href="http://www.buzzstream.com/blog/unfollow-algorithm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has shown that 45 percent of consumers will unfollow a brand if their platform is too heavy on self-promotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An editorial calendar will also help you with the crucial task of posting content at the optimal times for different platforms; after all, </span><a href="https://www.cubemc.com/cube/digital-trends-understanding-and-targeting-the-always-on-consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of consumers expect brands to know the right time to communicate. CoSchedule helpfully compiled </span><a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> looking at the best times to post on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest, and found that the ideal window varies wildly depending on both platform and industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to talk when your target audience is going to be listening.</span></p>
<h3><b>Choose Your Channels and Tone Accordingly</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you know how to communicate, you need to know the audience you’re communicating with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An April 2018 survey from Salesforce found that 67 percent of millennials/Gen Zers expect a personalized experience in their interactions with brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probe all the available information you have about your existing customer base, including location, age, language, income, and buying habits. You’ve already audited your social-media presence, but this is the time to dig deeper. Many social media platforms make it very easy to learn a lot about people already following and engaging with your brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As just one example of the potential to leverage that data to great effect, the Indian ride-sharing platform </span><a href="https://www.jugnoo.in/jugnootaxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jugnoo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began a social-media campaign to target new users and grow its user base. Using Facebook Analytics, the company learned that 90 percent of referrals came from users age 18 to 34, and that 65 percent of those people were students who used Android. They then began a targeted mobile app ads campaign specifically focused on the user profile, education, and device used. The result? More than 78,000 inactive users logged into the app and they acquired 28 percent more new customers compared to previous referral campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have an idea of your audience through social-media analytics and your own internal data, take all of that information to craft personas of current and prospective customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of simple demographic descriptions, it’s more effective to create layered, specific images of people who represent a segment of your audience. For instance, perhaps a big chunk of your customers could be accurately represented by Just-Graduated Greg, a 23-year-old intern at a tech company who lives with a roommate in Chicago, goes to spin classes three times a week, loves Thai food and listens to TED talks during his daily “L” train commute.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.itsma.com/whats-behind-the-customer-mask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from ITSMA found that 82 percent of companies using buyer personas said it has improved their value proposition, 90 percent say it has created a clearer understanding of their customers, and 56 percent said it helped lead to higher quality leads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The personas will also be helpful in finding your brand voice. Whether this is a short, targeted campaign with a clear goal – for instance, a coffee company looking to generate 50,000 shares of an Instagram video showcasing a new drink flavor – or a longer campaign with more multifaceted goals, defining the voice characteristics of your brand will go a long way toward establishing a consistent tone and building a stronger brand affinity with your audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might even be a good idea to explicitly document your ideal voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a brand voice style guide with pillars like ‘trusted quality’ and ‘delightfully inspired’ that we want to make sure are emulated,” </span><a href="https://www.branddrivendigital.com/behind-the-scenes-of-the-whole-foods-brand-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lisa Grimm, associate director of social media at Whole Foods Market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a better understanding of your target audience, it’ll become clearer which channels deserve more attention. If you’re speaking to senior citizens, your energy should be spent on Facebook and YouTube, used by </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/ft_19-04-10_socialmedia2019_useofdifferent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">46 percent and 38 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 65-plus population respectively, rather than Snapchat or Twitter, which are used by only </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/ft_19-04-10_socialmedia2019_useofdifferent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three and seven percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the older population. That said, it might be better not to vary your tone too much across different channels; </span><a href="https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/successful-branding-for-entrepreneurs-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 90 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of consumers expect their experience with a brand will be similar across all platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, knowing more about your audience will help you determine the right type and mix of content for your campaign. BuzzSumo </span><a href="https://okdork.com/why-content-goes-viral-what-analyzing-100-millions-articles-taught-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the social share counts of over 100 million articles and the result provides plenty of insight into the type of content that users want to share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re just beginning on your campaign, use insights like those to determine what type of imagery and content will resonate with your audience. Once you have your plan, stick to it. Studies from </span><a href="https://www.lucidpress.com/blog/25-branding-stats-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucidpress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that brands that are consistently presented are three to four times more likely to experience brand visibility, and the average revenue increase attributed to always presenting the brand consistently is 23 percent.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unsure about the future of eCommerce, consider this: each month, nearly 200 million people around the world log on to Amazon.com, the world’s leading online retailer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other global platforms are also experiencing growing success, and putting plenty of bricks-and-mortar retailers out of business in the process — from small, independent book shops to video store chains like Blockbuster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Purchases have grown year over year,” says Steve Tissenbaum, a Professor in the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending on Cyber Monday, all the way up to Christmas, has grown to 40 or 50 percent of purchases.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 BrainStation digital skills survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which included responses and thoughts on the current digital landscape from thousands of people around the world — more than 45 percent of executives say eCommerce is an area their organization is actively investing in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does all that mean for job seekers? </span></p>
<h2><b>Job Opportunities are Growing — Fast</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online shopping accounts for less than 10 percent of retail sales in the United States, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/06/business/ecommerce-retail-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s sparking big growth in new career opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment attributed to electronic shopping firms has doubled in the last five years, the authors note, and went up more than 330 per cent over the last decade and a half. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since 2007, the e-commerce sector, including fulfillment centers, has created 355,000 new jobs,” says Michael Mandel, Chief Economist Strategist for the Progressive Policy Institute, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2017/04/03/how-e-commerce-is-raising-pay-and-creating-jobs-around-the-country/#5f9ea0e86dff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that hiring boom comes from the fact that companies simply get more bang for their buck from eCommerce hires, by selling more products with fewer, better-paid workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the growth “far exceeds” the 51,000 jobs lost since 2007 in the general retail sector, Mandel adds.</span></p>
<h2><b>Tech Sector, Supply Chain Space Seeing Growth</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce is a broad field, and Tissenbaum says job growth is happening in several key areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more people in supply chain management, more programmers being involved, there are more sites, more apps&#8230; that generates a lot of opportunities for jobs in the tech sector,” he explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/social-media-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social media</a>, for instance, “is going to be very big” as companies continue striving to drive people to their online platforms and raise awareness amid an increasingly-competitive digital marketplace, Tissenbaum says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as physical storefronts are more likely to shutter, he says there will be a shift in those roles as well: The trend of fewer and fewer customer-facing retail jobs will continue, coupled with a rise in warehouse and transportation staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will be a greater need to satisfy consumers with deliveries,” Tissenbaun explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also predicts major growth in the rental sector, which could continually displace traditional retailers as environmentally-conscious (and often cash-strapped) younger generations strive to own a lot less — which could create major growth in that current niche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ll rent from furniture to cars to bikes, as we see now — and clothing,” he adds.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Job Seekers Can Put Their Best Foot Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone hoping to tap into eCommerce hiring sprees needs to take stock of their own skill set and put their best foot forward to land a gig in this rapidly-evolving and growing sphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tissenbaum says it’s important to keep in mind when job hunting which roles are on the rise (Programmers, Supply Chain Workers) and which ones are less secure (old-school retail jobs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will be an interesting time,” he says. “But it will be very different as to the skill set that&#8217;s needed now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the increasing need to advertise emerging online retailers, specializing in advertising and promotion will be key, particularly when those skills are coupled with a tech background. “Those people who are extremely adept at creating traffic through social media will be in greater demand,” says Tissenbaum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the bottom line, he adds, is to get the high-paid behind-the-scenes jobs making eCommerce a reality, there’s one key skill: “Everybody really needs to <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wplink-edit="true">learn how to program</a>,” he says.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-food restaurants have always been fiercely competitive, and the latest frontier for those old culinary rivalries? Social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-food and fast-casual chains have launched some seriously creative campaigns in recent years to win the attention – and appetites – of potential customers, and some of those clever social media marketing blitzes have resulted in real boosts to the bottom lines of some of America’s best-established brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see how they did it, we took a closer look at five of the most successful and impactful fast-food social media campaigns in recent years.</span></p>
<h2><b>Burger King’s Chicken Fries</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many venerable fast-food brands have struggled with the best way to lure millennials into their restaurants. In Burger King’s case, the trick was simply listening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2014, the company noticed an odd trend in social media: millennials were increasingly lamenting the disappearance of Burger King’s chicken fries, which had been removed from their menu two years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merely bringing back a popular menu item isn’t a stroke of genius, but the reason this campaign resonated to such a degree is that Burger King revived the snack with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tongue-in-cheek sense of humor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and presented the decision as a victory of sorts for the company’s loyal customers and social media followers.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" style="text-align: center;">You asked. We answered. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChickenFriesAreBack?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ChickenFriesAreBack</a> <a href="http://t.co/dYdwCSEw4P">pic.twitter.com/dYdwCSEw4P</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">— Stranger King (@BurgerKing) <a href="https://twitter.com/BurgerKing/status/497799904333271040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2014</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company received </span><a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/burger-king-getting-380-tweets-every-minute-chicken-fries-159545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">380 tweets every minute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the chicken-fry revival, while also garnering mainstream coverage from the likes of Time and the Huffington Post.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A YouGov survey of Millennials showed that their perceptions of Burger King increased 44 percent during the first two weeks of the campaign, while their impressions of McDonald’s and Wendy’s dropped 84 percent and 28 percent during the same time period. Meanwhile, sales jumped in the U.S. and Canada by the </span><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/burger-king-chicken-fries-helped-lift-u-s-sales-as-mcdonald-s-sales-fall-1.2085818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biggest amount in two years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not the only time Burger King got creative with a social media campaign. More recently, a group of influencers realized that Burger King was liking their old tweets and, of course, took to social media to speculate as to why – meaning Burger King was able to leverage their huge followings while simultaneously drawing </span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/casey-neistat-burger-king-twitter-feud/#5mtVYjoDksqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all with a few clicks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another clever attention-grabbing stunt was the company’s invitation to McDonald’s to team up for a “peace offering” called the McWhopper, which would raise awareness for Peace One Day. The proposal garnered lots of headlines, but it also had the added benefit of creating a backlash against their rivals when McDonald’s </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/McDonalds/posts/10156031225440584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>IHOP’s IHOb</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rarely has a brand created such a social-media stir by simply flipping a letter upside-down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, pancake chain IHOP </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that after 60 years in business, it was changing its name to IHOb – but provided no indication of why. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" style="text-align: center;">For 60 pancakin’ years, we’ve been IHOP. Now, we’re flippin’ our name to IHOb. Find out what it could b on 6.11.18. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IHOb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IHOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/evSxKV3QmT">pic.twitter.com/evSxKV3QmT</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">— IHOP (@IHOP) <a href="https://twitter.com/IHOP/status/1003682801042915328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2018</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tweet received nearly 50,000 shares and replies as the company’s social-media following guessed at what the name change could signify. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company eventually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the “b” was signaling a new line of burgers from the breakfast institution, that tweet received more than 75,000 shares and replies. Other fast-food chains even got in on the fun, with Burger King changing its profile to “Pancake King” and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Wendys/status/1006198612349673473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wendy’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DennysDiner/status/1006180048993505280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denny’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking playful shots at the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the genius of the stunt was how it worked over the news media. Major outlets including CNN, Time, and USA Today reported breathlessly on every twist in the saga, with the first batch of high-profile news stories coming at the announcement of the name change, the second with the burger reveal, and the third when IHOP </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only a month later that it was ditching the switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, there </span><a href="https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/ihop-s-selling-burgers-marketing-ploy/313872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were 1.8 million mentions of IHOB and 1 million mentions of IHOP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Twitter between June 1 and June 13, 2018, and the name switch generated roughly 15,000 media stories even before announcing they were reverting back to the original name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some decried the stunt as annoying, it certainly got people talking, and it won three Effie Awards, including gold in the restaurant category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think it was a huge success,” IHOP president Darren Rebelez </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ihop-ihob-name-change-boosts-brand-2018-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told Business Insider</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Literally everybody in the world now knows that IHOP is now selling burgers. That was goal No. 1. Goal No. 2 was to actually sell them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, they accomplished that too. Rebelez said restaurants saw </span><a href="https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/ihop-s-selling-burgers-marketing-ploy/313872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four to seven times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more burger orders after the name change.</span></p>
<h2><b>Taco Bell’s Taco Emoji</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many brands have recently angled after their own custom emojis – but only Taco Bell managed to turn it into a movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">#TacoEmoji</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign began somewhat organically, with Twitter users tagging Taco Bell wondering about the absence of a pixelated taco icon in their phones. A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change.org petition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> followed, garnering nearly 33,000 petitions in seven months, and the company even made </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">T-shirts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" style="text-align: center;">This <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TacoEmoji?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TacoEmoji</a> petition is no joke. So we made t-shirts. If you support it, wear it. <a href="http://t.co/QPOD8Xy6no">http://t.co/QPOD8Xy6no</a> <a href="http://t.co/LzJXv5z5Fd">pic.twitter.com/LzJXv5z5Fd</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">— Taco Bell (@tacobell) <a href="https://twitter.com/tacobell/status/560566048244523017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2015</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign was successful, and the Unicode Consortium – which regulates coding standards – eventually approved the taco emoji in June 2015. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the campaign wasn’t notable only because customers can text each other pictures of tacos now. The brilliance of Taco Bell’s marketing strategy lay in the rollout following Unicode’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after the emoji was introduced, the company launched the #TacoEmojiEngine campaign, promising that anyone who tweeted the taco and another emoji would instantly be rewarded with a reply from the company featuring a custom GIF. In all, Taco Bell created 600 original GIFs for the campaign and also rolled out four colorful and “highly Instagrammable” Doritos Locos Taco holders that featured the emoji in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the campaign was obviously a stunt, executives with the company said it worked because it carried an undercurrent of authenticity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is about the taco having its rightful place in the official emoji keyboard – this wasn’t about us doing a branded thing,” </span><a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/heres-why-taco-bell-created-600-gifs-and-photos-its-new-social-campaign-168007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marisa Thalberg, Chief Brand Engagement Officer for Taco Bell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had our hopes raised and dashed a few times along the way, but ultimately Unicode came through, and it’s here.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Domino’s – Honesty is the Best Policy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2010, with profits declining and sales sagging, Domino’s adopted an interesting strategy: tell the truth about its previously lackluster pizza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, introducing a newly reformulated pizza recipe by insulting the old one was risky, but the clever </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apology tour</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign essentially established a new overarching strategy of blunt honesty that has served the brand extremely well since.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AH5R56jILag" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same year they started saying sorry, Domino’s launched the Show Us Your Pizza campaign and began sharing unvarnished photos of its pizza and other products from real customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the pizza sometimes look </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greasy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">messy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dimly lit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Sure, but it also looks real, and it’s clear that the strategy is working; Domino’s is the industry leader on Instagram according to a </span><a href="https://www.qsrmagazine.com/marketing-promotions/which-restaurant-brands-rule-social-media-universe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study from ShareIQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which found that the brand received 1.4 million likes in the first few months of 2018, compared to 197,000 for McDonald’s and 127,000 for Wendy’s.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this space, we actually are finding that less than perfect is sometimes actually perfect,” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90138198/dominos-could-win-the-pizza-wars-by-being-grosser-than-everyone-else" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dennis Maloney, Domino’s Chief Digital Officer. “A lot of customers are out photographing their food. They know, depending on where you take it and the light you’re under, food looks different. It feels much more honest and transparent when the images are imperfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if it is a little bit gooey, greasy, the packaging isn’t perfect, and there’s a bit of a burnt spot, that’s the pizza you get,” he added. “And that makes you think how good it was last time you had it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another clever campaign Domino’s launched recently was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">#PavingForPizza</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which the company urged customers to nominate potholes in their town for repair. The campaign elicited 54,000 social-media mentions, drew mainstream news coverage, and led to more than 137,000 nominations in all 50 states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this attention is paying real dividends. In 2018, Domino’s finally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overtook</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pizza Hut as the top pizza chain in the U.S. with $12.3 billion in gross sales.</span></p>
<h2><b>Starbucks’ Unicorn Frappuccino</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to social media marketing successes, Starbucks’ Unicorn Frappuccino really does seem like the stuff of mythology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the rollout of its Frappuccino Happy Hour, the coffee chain unveiled the vibrantly hued, sugar-loaded frozen treat and social media pretty much lost its collective mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the single week, the Unicorn Frapp was available in April 2017, there were more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">180,000 posts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media featuring the bright beverage. The mango-flavored drink became a media sensation too. News outlets ran dozens of stories </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigating its ingredients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conducting taste tests</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even late-night comics got in on the action, with Stephen Colbert performing a “hate-taste” of the beverage and Jimmy Kimmel teasing that it looks like a “windbreaker from the ‘80s.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBBDlgwm8dg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s got everything in it but coffee,” he </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jimmy-kimmel-starbucks-unicorn-frappuccino-spoof-2017-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Who says America doesn’t invent anything anymore? It’s only available through April 23 or when someone dies from drinking it, whatever comes first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So yes, many of the reviews were less-than-glowing. But there’s no arguing with the value of the publicity it generated – in just one week, the Unicorn Frappuccino led to an increase and a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 percent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase in same-store sales for that quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That social-media success has been tough to replicate for the Seattle-based company. Last March, the limited-time-only Crystal Ball Frappuccino was unveiled, but it only drove an incremental 0.4 percent increase in social media mentions, compared with 6.5 percent for the Unicorn Frappuccino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unicorns really are rare.</span></p>
