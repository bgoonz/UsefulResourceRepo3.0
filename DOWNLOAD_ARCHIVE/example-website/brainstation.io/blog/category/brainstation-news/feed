<p>Miami’s tech industry has turned into a new global hub for the digital economy over the last few years, and it continues to grow rapidly. Demand for digital skills, however, remains greater than the supply of qualified employees, and that skills gap is growing. In fact, the World Economic Forum estimates that emerging technologies will generate 133 million new jobs in the next year, with more than half of all employees requiring significant reskilling.</p>



<p>To prepare the workforce for these opportunities, BrainStation offers part-time and full-time bootcamps, both online and in-person at its campuses in Miami, New York, London, and Toronto, among others. Over 90% of BrainStation graduates find employment within six months of graduation, with the company providing access to an exclusive hiring network and ongoing career guidance and support, including resume writing and job applications, personal branding, interview preparation, and more.&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cybersecurity: What Leaders Need to Know in 2021 – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on July 8th, and featured the four experts leading cybersecurity strategy at financial services giant Mastercard, investment firm Blackstone, professional networking site LinkedIn, and software developer Citrix.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/573163872?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;speed=0&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479/embed" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></div>


<p>Our panelists agreed that the need for cybersecurity has grown by leaps over the past year and a half – more on that below. But what exactly does cybersecurity entail?</p>



<p>Eugene Dvorochkin, Senior Member of the Information Security team at LinkedIn, summarizes cybersecurity as “using technology, processes, and controls to protect systems, network, and data. Ultimately, everything goes back to the data&#8230;All we’re trying to do is protect that data, protect its integrity, and make sure [there’s no] unauthorized use of it.”</p>



<p>As Kurt Roemer, Chief Security Strategist at Citrix, explains, cybersecurity’s traditional focus on maintaining data’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability should expand to include a fourth factor: safety. “As we adopt IoT and other artificial intelligence and [augmented reality applications], it’s integrating with our physical world in a way where safety becomes critically important.”</p>



<p>Puneet Bhatnagar, Senior Vice President / IAM Lead – Cybersecurity at Blackstone, takes a more philosophical approach: “I ask myself the fundamental question of ‘How can I help build trust into the design of systems? Do I feel comfortable signing up for an application when I’m offering my personal details? Do I trust the brand that I’m offering that information to?’ It’s important for corporations to see cybersecurity as everything they need to do to build trust within their applications and ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Sukhmani Dev, Vice President of Digital &amp; Security Solutions at Mastercard, concurs. “We want to make sure that trust is reflected in every single transaction.”</p>



<p>Achieving that ultimate goal is as dynamic a process as technology itself. Below are just a few of the broader trends our panelists identified.</p>



<h2><strong>Cybersecurity Is More Important Than Ever</strong></h2>



<p>COVID-19 and the resulting explosion of work-from-home culture has compressed an evolution that was expected to take a decade into a matter of months. That acceleration means more online activity, more new users, and more complexity in the individual systems those users rely on, all of which spells opportunity for bad actors. The result is a sudden and acute need for more digital security.</p>



<p>Much of that need comes down to simple volume; during lockdown, more people worked and shopped from devices in their homes. Dvorochkin explains, “When you’re using your home network, you’re potentially using personal devices like your personal computer or iPhone to access corporate environments and data, and you’re also dependent more on third-party systems such as Zoom or other communication methods. You’re coming into harder-to-secure environments.”</p>



<p>For many large international companies, accommodating remote work was relatively straightforward. But for many smaller brick-and-mortar businesses, this meant a first foray into the digital world – and these are particularly vulnerable to hackers. “[It’s a misconception] that only big, well-known companies are the targets of attacks,” Dvorochkin continues. “Hackers have gotten more advanced, but also the tools and techniques that they use have basically become public. Anyone can go online and start hacking any company. It’s not just large, well-known companies that are being targeted by sophisticated hackers – it can be literally any mom-and-pop shop.”</p>



<p>Dev identifies the growing complexity of systems as another vector. “Everything is more interconnected than ever,” she says. “If you think about a bank, they may have their suppliers, but then their suppliers have suppliers, and these are massive supply chains. The connection points have grown exponentially in the last few years.”</p>



<p>This means more weak links for hackers to exploit – and hackers have taken notice.</p>



<h2><strong>Moving From Systems to Users</strong></h2>



<p>The growth in scale and complexity also means cybersecurity teams are fighting on more fronts than ever. This in turn is leading to a change in the way cybersecurity experts conceive of their task. If the goal is to secure data within a digital fortress, cybersecurity’s job is to protect the perimeter – but the perimeter and modes of attacking it are ever-changing. Locking data down is not the answer – there’s no point in having a system if nobody can access it. Instead, the priority is shifting to, first, confirming the identities of the people accessing it, and second, granting access to only the data they need, rather than the entire system.</p>



<p>“Before, you might have had certain things that could only be considered secure when they were in the four walls,” Roemer says. “What if you turn that around and say, ‘How do we secure these when it’s outside the four walls, in the cloud?’ When you look at the hybrid work model, you have people working in different situations potentially every week – in an office, in their home, maybe in a coffee shop again, maybe out traveling. How do you make sure that you’ve got the right security environment available for those individuals?”</p>



<p>For Bhatnagar, this means “the only real perimeter you have that you can truly secure is your identity perimeter.” This typically demands multi-factor authentication, which helps to verify that people are who they say they are (“There’s some crazy statistics out there,” Bhatnagar says, “like, more than 90% of breaches originated from some sort of email compromise”).</p>



<p>As a result, “It’s not enough to just have a good network perimeter or to have a good set of firewalls. You have to move your thinking from being systems- or network-centric to being identity- or user-centric. That’s when we started thinking about these newer paradigms of zero trust. With the kind of volume of information that people are constantly accessing, you’re always going to be playing catch-up if you’re just trying to patch the system or secure the network.”</p>



<p>Shifting focus to the user’s identity helps eliminate access to outside hackers, but it also helps contain risk from the inside by limiting even legitimate users’ access to the data they need. This, of course, depends on the ability to parse the data at your disposal. Dvorochkin explains, “Back in the day, companies were over-privileging people, and they were able to access everything <em>carte blanche</em>, which obviously leads to a lot more risk. [You need to be] very specific about all the data that you have. You don’t know what you don’t know, so good identification tagging is very important – to know exactly where your data is located, how much of it there is, and the transactions you have with it, especially with third-party suppliers. Because, again, we’re becoming more and more dependent on third-party applications, and they’re obviously not at the same level of trust as our internal employees. It all comes back to identification, having a good asset inventory of it, and being able to limit it.”</p>



<h2><strong>Culture and Education Are Key</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t implement any kind of cybersecurity strategy unless your teammates are on board. And human beings are always the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain – most hacking is done not by writing code but by posing as an authority and tricking someone into giving up a password. The solution here is as much social as it is technological.</p>



<p>“Cybersecurity is not one person or one team’s responsibility,” Bhatnagar says. “Everybody needs to roll up their sleeves and own it. We lay a lot of emphasis on end-user awareness training, helping them identify phishing emails, doing simulations of phishing, and incrementally advancing the complexity of these simulations, just so we’re constantly educating our people.”</p>



<p>This can directly cut down on individual instances of data breaches, but it also helps cultivate a company-wide culture that values cybersecurity. “Once you put that out there, it’s a language that everybody understands – that it’s not just your cybersecurity professionals who need to be super technical, but that there’s a general framework other business leaders can understand. You can use that to raise awareness and to get the budget and the funding and the resources you need to keep making strategic improvements.”</p>



<p>Dev seconds the importance of corporate culture. “And along with culture,” she says, “I would also say training….It’s a very different way of thinking and operating, as compared to legacy systems. The rest of the technology, design, and so on will fall in place if you have the attitude to culture right.”</p>



<p>For Roemer, this starts at the top. “Security is a shared responsibility, and we all need to be security practitioners. Leadership needs to go to HR and let them know that security capabilities are needed across the organization and talk about how they can provide reskilling and advancement opportunities for those who find security to be a compelling career, and be able to pull those individuals – not just from the IT organization but from across the org, as it makes sense – and so reach out to the rest of the organization [and communicate that] we desperately need additional security professionals and we all need to be considered practitioners.”</p>



<h2><strong>Shifting From Tactics to Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>Somewhat paradoxically, given the shift in focus from total system security to the user identity perimeter, we’re also seeing a shift away from tactics and toward platforms – that is, to organizing cybersecurity efforts into a holistic strategy, rather than an array of individual patches.</p>



<p>Roemer explains, “The reason for this is that it has become very difficult to manage [a collection of] point products. They don’t integrate well, and we don’t have the resources to use them to their effectiveness. So the more we can build and consolidate into a platform, the more we can amplify security capabilities.”</p>



<p>Dvorochkin adds that this means co-ordinating not just tactics but also entire teams. “Oftentimes, technology domains or functions are siloed. We’re obviously all trying to achieve the same goal, which is to make the firm successful.”</p>



<p>For Bhatnagar, a more strategic approach includes having a well-staffed and -funded security operations center. While it’s always good to be proactive, that doesn’t mean a breach won’t eventually happen, and when it does, it’s imperative that an organization is ready to spring into action. “There’s always things that are going to come out of left field, because hackers continue to get more advanced, and their techniques continue to get more persistent.”</p>



<h2><strong>Cybersecurity Is Always Dynamic</strong></h2>



<p>Dvorochkin echoes Bhatnagar’s sentiment – responsiveness is crucial. Cybersecurity strategy needs to be dynamic in order to counter attacks both proactively and reactively. On the reactive side, he says, “It’s not a matter of <em>if</em>, it’s a matter of <em>when</em> you’ll get breached; it’s almost impossible to fully be protected on an ongoing basis. Something eventually is going to get through. Protecting the perimeter is important, having good detective controls is important – but you also need to have a good response, good evaluation, and be able to test yourself.”</p>



<p>On the proactive side, this means constantly evaluating your strategy; you can’t just set it and forget it. “[There’s a] misconception that, ‘Okay, well, we invested in technology, we did this one-time setup, we have a cybersecurity program, we’re good to go,” Dvorochkin continues. “A one-time setup of implementing some tools – it’s not going to protect you. Technology changes almost on a daily basis because of the synergistic relationship between tech and cyber, and cybersecurity is changing just as fast. So you have to be dynamic, you have to always be up to date, and you have to have good investment from your company – because cybersecurity is not cheap.”</p>



<p>“Consider your information technology portfolio a set of investments,” Roemer adds. “As with your personal investments, go through from time to time and re-evaluate what’s working well, what’s not, and where you need to dump the dogs and move on to something that’s going to give you a better return. Security is very much like that. We need the agility, and if you consider your information technology portfolio not as a sunk set of decisions but as a set of investments that are constantly evaluated, you can help to move forward and address today’s and tomorrow’s security needs.”<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VANCOUVER, BC &#8212; BrainStation, the global leader in digital skills training, has partnered with BC Tech to create the BC Reskilling program, which aims to help unemployed, underemployed, and transitioning workers learn new skills for new careers in technology. Funding for this training is provided by the Government of Canada, through the Canada-British Columbia Workforce Development Agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the BC Reskilling program, BrainStation will provide individuals in need with cutting-edge digital skills training through its award-winning <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=BCTechReskillPartnership">User Experience (UX) Design</a> and <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=BCTechReskillPartnership">Web Development</a> bootcamps. </p>



<p>BrainStation and BC Tech previously partnered in 2020 to offer UX Design and Web Development bootcamps to unemployed and underemployed BC residents. This initiative resulted in 55 students finding work within six months of graduation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“BrainStation’s mission is to empower individuals with digital skills that launch or accelerate their careers. We are excited to be BC Tech’s training partner on their latest initiative to invest in digital skill training as part of BC’s economic recovery,” said Kyle Treleaven, Vice President and General Manager at BrainStation Vancouver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vancouver’s tech sector continues to grow, with a number of unicorn companies – such as  Thinkific, Clio, Dapper Labs, Abcellera, and Galvanize – making their marks on the world’s stage. The sector’s continued growth, however, is reliant on the development of local talent, as there are now more job opportunities than qualified professionals to fill these emerging roles in the workforce.</p>



<p>BrainStation’s bootcamps were designed to help individuals take advantage of exciting new digital careers, with a collaborative, project-based learning experience, and curriculum updated in real-time, ensuring students always learn cutting-edge, in-demand skills that can be applied in a real-world setting. Since 2012, the company has seen over 90% of its graduates find work within 180 days of graduation.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cover letters, resumes, and networking are an important part of the job application process. But to really stand out and show off your skills, there’s another tool that every digital marketing professional should add to their job search toolkit: the portfolio.</p>



<p><strong>From TikTok to Clubhouse</strong> – the latest in<a href="https://brainstation.io/events/online"> BrainStation’s Digital Leadership Event Series</a> – took place on May 27th, and featured the experts who lead social and digital engagement at <strong>Twitter</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, branding agency <strong>Sid Lee</strong>, and disruptive beauty company <strong>DECIEM</strong>.</p>



<p>You can watch the full panel discussion here:</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/557220380" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p> </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a platform for marketing, social media has been growing for years. But while advertising buys are becoming more streamlined (especially with the increase in user and demographic data that social media can provide), achieving valuable organic reach is still elusive – especially as a host of new platforms leaves audiences more fragmented than ever.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s opportunity in these changes. The arrival of new platforms creates new ways to reach potential customers and new ways to interact with them – and as these audiences fragment, it gives marketers the ability to target their outreach more precisely.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Into this shifting landscape, 2020 introduced a global pandemic, widespread lockdowns, and massive social protests – to name just a few of last year’s most transformative events. Each of them threw Social Media Marketers another curveball, forcing them to find ways to adapt. But in at least some of these challenges was a chance to connect with audiences in meaningful ways and build digital communities that will hopefully continue to thrive even as the pandemic winds down.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How have recent events shaped the world of social media marketing? What changes can we expect to see in the future, and how to best capitalize on them?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>A.I. Is Becoming Indispensable</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As social media audiences grow and diversify, brands have more opportunities than ever to personalize their outreach to each user for more effective results – but the explosion in data is more than anyone can manage single-handedly. Fortunately, data analytics and A.I. are stepping up to help Marketers understand user behavior and tailor their social media strategies around the actions that will be most impactful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Corissa Henry, Head of Digital at beauty company DECIEM, explains, “Two things that I’ve seen grow quite a bit in importance across all the brands that I’ve worked with have been the roles of artificial intelligence and personalization. And those two are actually quite intertwined. A.I. allows you to analyze consumer behavior and search patterns, and to use that data to help you understand how your customers are finding your products or services. This can then help you personalize how you approach those customers, so you can send the right message to the right person at the right time. What I’ve seen across all of the brands I’ve worked with is this evolution toward focusing in on who your customers are, where they are, and how to speak to them in a way that’s relevant to them, rather than just blasting information at them.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>One Platform Can Host Many Communities</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This deep knowledge of your customers – where they are and how to reach them – is becoming indispensable as social media platforms proliferate; each platform is unique in its tone, culture, and the type of content that performs. But these individual platforms are diversifying as well, becoming home to myriad micro-communities united by interests that range from the fundamental to the highly esoteric.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>TikTok, for example, launched with a relatively homogenous group of users. But the power of TikTok’s algorithm is how quickly it learns what viewers want to engage in, showing them more of that type of content, even in niche categories. In this way, TikTok is able to assemble loose communities along extremely fine-grained interests – which can be gold to marketers who know how to connect to them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“There are hundreds of different communities that exist and operate distinctly on each social platform,” explains Jason Berk, Head of Social and Digital at branding agency Sid Lee. “What started as a pocket of people that created a close-knit, very specific, narrow community then started growing and adding more people….[Today,] it’s lots of different people of different demographics – a thriving LGBTQ+ community, people of color, DIYers, gamers, animal lovers, foodies, cosplayers, people in uniform….There’s a lot of the world that quite often major media doesn’t pay attention to. But they’re on TikTok….That’s really great about TikTok for marketers – if you have something to sell and there’s a specific demo, it’s there on TikTok.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Twitter, meanwhile, is the birthplace of many conversations that ultimately take place at a cultural level, be it politics, movies, or something else entirely. Win Sakdinan<strong>, </strong>Twitter’s Head of Business Marketing for North America, explains, “Twitter is the home for very influential people, people who really want to be in the know….That classic adoption curve – Twitter users are always at the low part, as [trends] start, and then it starts to spread out. When you reach these individuals, whether you’re a brand or an individual talking about a certain topic, it spreads fast to other channels. It gets onto the news, goes to Instagram, to Facebook, to Clubhouse, to TED Talks, and everything.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, discussions and trends emerging organically on social media are not a new phenomenon. The trick is how to leverage those conversations.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Social Media Leads to More Casual, Authentic Interactions</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Compared to the traditional ad-buy model where brands strictly control the message they disseminate to the world, social media is much more interactive – which lends it responsiveness and “realness” not found in other media. In fact, a tradeoff exists here: some marketing messages are glossy, tightly controlled, and on-message, while others are more casual and down to earth – and that authenticity means relinquishing some control.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In fact, controlling your message is antithetical to organic growth. For some brands, that’s OK – traditional advertising is still an option. But for brands pursuing more organic reach through social, you can only hope to contribute to a larger conversation, not to control it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Public chat network Clubhouse is one example of a platform where brand messaging must take a backseat, Berk says. “Creating a strategy that will work [on Clubhouse is something] that you can’t really plan for. You can create the bones of a strategy, but you can’t plan the content like you would on other social networks.” For his agency, which works with brands on a consulting basis, this can mean some difficult conversations about whether social is really where they want to focus. “We always ask our clients, would you share this with your friend? Would you send this over to your mom? And if the answer’s no, the question is, why are you doing it, and is social the right place for it?” Berk advises brands to ask, “‘Do you really want an organic social strategy?’ Everyone says they do. They’re like, ‘Well, I want 100 million followers and I want all these impressions and I want people to love us.’ It’s like, OK, then you can’t put your brand first. You have to participate in a conversation.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But for Pamela Saunders, Public Relations &amp; Social Impact Lead at Microsoft, organic growth isn’t about going viral: “Everybody knows who Microsoft is. I don’t need to build a brand – I’m coming at it from a very different perspective. What I learned pretty quickly was that we needed to demystify who we are as a company – what does it mean to people locally? What does it mean to companies locally? Who wants to work with us, with an understanding of what we really stand for? And we found social was a really great place to talk about that. We were able to profile employees. We were able to showcase the kinds of things that we do within our walls, the kinds of work that we do in a really grassroots sort of way….I have the opportunity to be separate from the brand side, where the communications have to be that slick, really pretty photography and video that big brands are known for.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Saunders’s goals at Microsoft are more focused on building relationships over the long term. “For us, success is really when somebody applies for a job here,” she says, “and what they tell us is, ‘I’ve been watching the videos, I’ve been seeing the content, and  I’m really interested in this team because I feel like they align with the kinds of things I want to do.’ That’s where I’m measuring it….Maybe they didn’t share our videos because it wasn’t that type of content, but it really resonated and stuck in their head. That’s super successful for me.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The COVID-19 Pandemic Changed the Landscape</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Henry explains, many brands that reach users by being authentic and approachable got a boost in 2020. “One of the truths of the pandemic is that, in order to be together safely someday, for a while, we had to figure out how to be together apart. Social media stepped in to fill that void for so many people….It’s been amazing to see how, a little more than a year ago, everything was focused on hyper-productivity and consumption, and now it’s all about mental health and well-being. [As a result,] there’s a lot more realness to what the platforms have. And I think that going forward, that is what brands are going to have to adopt. They’re going to have to learn to speak to people on the level that they’re at, rather than having it be like that glossy ad trying to advertise to you.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Saunders echoes Henry’s sentiments: “There was a focus on video a couple of years ago when…we were all building video teams, trying to figure out how to manage it and stay true to the vision that our brands had always had about producing video – really nice looking stuff. Those platforms started to change the way that people were interacting with video. And what we’ve seen over the pandemic is a real lean in to that. We don’t see as much heavily produced content. It’s about being a little bit messy because we’ve all been trapped in our houses and trying to share things and be real because we can’t connect in real life. That has shifted the way we think about using social, and I don’t see us ever going back.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If we can’t go back, how do we go forward? “How do brands shift again, and make it more about providing value as people come out of their cocoons and do things, versus providing value for people while they’re on lockdown?” Berk says. “Now the challenge is, how do brands provide that value to communities and individuals that are not stuck inside anymore, and want to start having experiences again?”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This speaks directly to the challenge of maintaining social media’s influence throughout more of the marketing funnel during the pandemic – not just creating awareness, but also providing seamless entry into shopping and even point-of-sale. “Part of [the pandemic-driven shift to social] was that I couldn’t go out and shop the way I used to,” Saunders says. “And I started adapting what my expectations were….One of the things that I’ve seen – and I think this is a shift that you’ll see brands really navigating over the coming year – is we’re all starting to move outside again. But a lot of us have established online shopping or online routines that I think will continue….I want the same kind of closeness that I felt to some of the brands that I’ve been shopping with over the last year….I want that frictionless [experience], I want to go from great content right into the store to buy the thing.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This brings us back to the question of how to leverage conversations playing out online to build organic reach. Using data to meet users where they are and engage with them in a less rigid, more authentic way are two important strategies; another strategy comes down to timing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Seize the Moment</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Social media is driven by conversations, trends, and other content that tends to occur in cycles – meaning it’s a clean slate every day. To get in on that conversation means being flexible and ready to move when an opportunity appears. That being said, not every social media event is an opportunity for marketing; brands have been burned in the past by trying to capitalize on tragedy, simply because the topic was trending. There’s a time and place for brands to add their voice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At Twitter, 2020 was a good example of how challenging that can be. Between the pandemic, the first anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, the Black Lives Matter protests, and the attack on Capitol Hill, 2020 was a banner year for driving user engagement at Twitter – but none of these events made for a good branding moment – meaning brands had to learn how to co-exist in the same space as these discussions, even though, in most cases, direct participation in them was not appropriate. So even while engagement was up, Win says, “advertising spend dropped dramatically during the start COVID. People weren’t going to be receptive to brand messages. [Over time,] things got a little bit better, and you realized people still need to brush their teeth and drive cars and watch movies and everything. So things came back.” Still, these newsworthy events never stop happening.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One solution, then, is to initiate a conversation. Win uses the example of McDonald’s launching a new Big Mac, this one with bacon. They could simply shout the message, paying for advertising to raise awareness. But for organic reach, McDonald’s could also begin a conversation. “Big Mac with bacon – is it still a Big Mac?” Win says. This leads to debate, which grows reach organically while still keeping the conversation on track to meet the brand’s objective. “When you’re driving conversation, there’s an art and science to it that we’re starting to crack that drives more brand relevance, drives more reach and frequency and organic, and it impacts your purchase funnel, ultimately. But it’s getting that sweet spot.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Berk, opportunity lurks in existing conversations that are brand-adjacent – not making the conversation about the brand itself, but using the moment to introduce yourself. This is especially true of platforms like Clubhouse, where centering the brand is especially frowned upon. Instead, find a topic that’s brand-adjacent and contribute something that’s valuable to users. In the case of the new Big Mac, Berk explains how such a strategy could play out on Clubhouse: “Clubhouse is not a place for McDonald’s to exist, but it could be a place where the chef that helped create the Big Mac with bacon could say, ‘Hey everyone, I created the Big Mac with bacon and it is absolutely a Big Mac.’ People would say you’re sharing something really interesting, and you’re an authority on this, and that’s going to bring people into that room and start a massive conversation. So I think there is a tremendous opportunity for brands on Clubhouse, especially because there’s a lot of white space there.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Henry gives another example of a brand seizing a moment that arose organically on TikTok. “Earlier this week, I got an email from a bookstore chain [with] a series of books that were trending on #BookTok” – a hashtag used by TikTok’s book-loving community, one that has put books on the bestseller list years after they were released. “I’m obsessed with #BookTok, so I instantly clicked on it to see what books they were selecting. I already owned a bunch of them, and I ended up buying a few more. This is an excellent example of a brand capitalizing on a moment where media and culture met in a way that was relevant to their brand without waiting for their particular brand to be mentioned. Because, in the digital space, we always have to have our ears to the ground to be able to strategically pinpoint moments of relevance for our brand. It doesn’t have to be that our brand is specifically being mentioned, but it could be something in the zeitgeist that is relevant to our brand.” </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Henry, a successful campaign is one that “people found valuable and engaged with in a way so that they shared it, in addition to us having paid media behind it. I come to all of my social media campaigns with a single North Star, and that begins and ends with the audience.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cover letters, resumes, and networking are an important part of the job application process. But to really stand out and show off your skills, there’s another tool that every digital marketing professional should add to their job search toolkit: the portfolio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To help you create a digital marketing portfolio, we asked BrainStation Instructor and Shopify Social Media Producer Francesca Saraco some questions about digital marketing portfolios.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here’s why you need a digital marketing portfolio – even if you don’t have work experience – and how to create one that will help you stand out in the job market.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h3>Why Do You Need a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whether you’re looking for a job or you love your job, it’s never a bad idea to have a digital marketing portfolio on the go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“It’s important to have a showcase of your work because you never know when you’ll be asked for it,” says Saraco. “Showcasing your work helps you be discovered by potential employers. Plus, it’s nice to see how far you’ve come, how much you’ve grown and the different trajectories your work has taken.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Keeping an up-to-date portfolio shows that you’re dedicated and engaged, and could lead to new connections or even job offers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>What Is in a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s easy to guess what kind of work a Writer, Designer, or Web Developer might showcase in their portfolio. But when it comes to a digital marketing portfolio, the content might be less obvious. That’s because digital marketing often involves teamwork, strategic thinking, and planning that can’t always be captured in a writing sample or image.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Sometimes people in more strategy-driven roles are more challenged with what they can put in a portfolio because their work is thinking based,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The solution, says Saraco, is to show a tangible product, credit the team you worked with, and then explain what your role was.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example, you could feature a few photos from an Instagram campaign with a caption that describes your role: Did you develop the strategic plan? Write the copy? Coordinate the digital ad buy? Explain your role and how you contributed to the results. Sharing analytics information alongside visuals is another way to highlight your skills (especially for search engine marketing or search engine optimization projects), but be sure you can back up what your role was and how you contributed to success.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>What Do I Include in My Portfolio If I Don’t Have Digital Marketing Experience?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you don’t have any digital marketing work experience, you can still start making a portfolio. Focus first on personal projects and social media profiles, which can be a way to showcase your digital marketing skills and sensibilities.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“You can showcase your own content, whether that’s an email newsletter that you write biweekly, or a strong Twitter presence or Instagram presence. That can be shown off in a portfolio to show potential employers how you think and how you create,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you prefer to keep your personal profiles private, consider starting a passion project (like an Instagram or blog dedicated to houseplants or cooking) and featuring it on your portfolio.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Digital marketing courses can help in this area, as many will allow you to complete work in a number of areas.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Projects from school are a great portfolio piece to show your thinking process and skills,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Can I Feature Client Work on My Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you do have digital marketing work experience, you might be wondering if it’s okay to feature client work in your portfolio. To avoid any issues, it’s important to ask first.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Simply emailing and asking for consent goes a long way. This is something you can do as your exiting a job or internship, or when a project is complete,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When featuring client work Saraco also emphasizes the importance of crediting others who worked on the project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Don’t take credit for content that’s not yours, that’s really important. There is no shame in crediting collaborators on a project. It shows that you can work on a team,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How Do I Start Making a Digital Marketing Portfolio?</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To start making a digital marketing portfolio, you’ll want to first find a portfolio website to help you organize and showcase your work. There are currently a wide range of free or relatively cost-effective websites that offer ready-made or customizable templates for online portfolios. Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly are just a few of the options available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember that the portfolio itself becomes an example of your work, so it’s important to choose a platform that you’re comfortable using.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Keep it nice and organized, create a nice user experience and show off your personality,” says Saraco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once your portfolio is ready to go, make it easy to find by adding a link in your resume, on your LinkedIn page, and your social media accounts.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The stories of managing a work-life balance during a pandemic are plentiful and profound. The challenge of balancing ever-changing priorities is only magnified in the lives of parents raising young children.&nbsp;We wanted to take a moment to recognize the amazing parents pivoting their careers during a pandemic and graduated from a <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses">BrainStation Online Bootcamp</a>; a feat that shouldn’t go unnoticed.</p>



<p>They’ve continued to go above and beyond and have shared their experiences, with advice for fellow parents who are thinking about learning new skills and changing their careers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why Start a New Challenge?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many reasons why parents may decide to take on a bootcamp. For some, losing a job during a pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to tackle something new and earn a new career. Others saw their growing family as the spark they needed to make a career transition.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JS0d1EMh8enZ2FHOhkjNWnMQUsugGgMokakbN3bpbqqKtklwLn9xHUcdpTZGgxIxCYvEzR-bnkWN8xuhKAM1qAoycMBw0jukBPpEgM8Khw7XT1xPC5A5JHCeHgWmsacfN1ozlxMy" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development</a> graduate Jessica Kwok started the bootcamp with a background in Kinesiology and saw maternity leave as the perfect time to jump into a new career. She shared that finding remote learning was a big factor. “As a new mom, being able to do the bootcamp remotely was a major priority for me,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ultimately chose BrainStation because they were well versed in delivering content online (even before Covid!) and had an impressive growing alumni network.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elyse Renouf has a background in business consulting and recently graduated from our <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp">Data Science Bootcamp</a>. She shared that Covid-19 layoffs, daycare closures, and a desire for a more technical role that could be remote was the perfect storm to spur the need for a change and take on a course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tight and Tricky Schedules</h2>



<p>So what does studying while being a parent look like? Think packed schedules, lots of help from friends and family, and getting creative with distracting little ones.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12735" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1024x882.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-300x258.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-768x661.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-1536x1322.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents-960x827.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183045/Parents.jpg 1604w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Angus Ryer, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp">Web Development </a>Graduate with a history in construction, shared his schedule:</p>



<ul><li>Wake up to my nine-month old crying</li><li>Go wake up my three-year old</li><li>Get breakfast ready, eat together, take the boys out for a walk while my wife works out</li><li>Make coffee number two</li><li>Hop online for class at 10:30 am</li><li>Listen intently and work on projects until 1 pm</li><li>Help my older boy get settled into a nap</li><li>Power through classes from 2:00 pm to 6:30 pm&nbsp;</li><li>Spend some time with my kids, eat dinner (made with love by my wife), and then settle my older one into bed</li><li>&#8220;Relax&#8221; on the couch with my wife, half-distracted by MasterChef Australia or InkMasters while I continued to study work in the concepts I had learned</li><li>Rinse and repeat!</li></ul>



<p>Other parents shared similar busy schedules, commenting that despite the lack of personal time, it was all worth it to have a brand new bootcamp credentials in only three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s scary. That&#8217;s natural. The biggest rewards usually come from the biggest risks,” said Armando Pastorin, a <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-user-experience-design-bootcamp">UX Design Bootcamp</a> Graduate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This process is mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausting for everyone,” Renouf admits. With the mix of parenting and household responsibilities while studying, it can be tempting to doubt your decision or want to quit. Luckily, her son helped provide the motivation she needed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12737" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1024x545.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-300x160.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-768x408.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-1536x817.jpg 1536w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4-960x510.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183231/parents4.jpg 1999w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“I did this course and am making this career change so I can get to see him more so despite how overwhelming it was at the time, I truly believe it was all worth it.”</p>



<h2>Advice for Parents Going Back to School&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Each parent was keen to share advice for other parents looking to learn remotely. Here are some of our favorite tips:</p>



<p>“Surround yourself with people who can encourage and support you along the way. As much as we&#8217;d all like to be the &#8220;super-mom&#8221; or &#8220;super-dad&#8221; who single handedly got through a bootcamp while watching your child full time, having people who can help you out and root for you is extremely valuable to your success.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<p>“Take help where needed from your family, friends or whoever you like to get some quiet time to finish your work. During my Coffee and Conversation sessions, I came across a lot of parents from different cohorts, with whom I would exchange ideas on time management and so much more which helped me a lot. &#8221; &#8211; Bonney Halani</p>



<p>“Set a schedule leading up to the program and help your kids get into that routine, so that they expect you to be focused at specific times. Kids (and grown-ups) tend to go crazy if they don&#8217;t get enough attention, so by committing to giving them the right amount of time, it&#8217;s easier to give yourself periods of focus without the kids tugging at your pant legs.” &#8211; Angus Ryer</p>



<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any sitters, no family, and at first, no daycare, and it was madness. If you can, identify where you can make your life a little smoother by either meal prepping, freezing leftovers, or ordering take out to save time. Keep snacks on your desk and relax your screen time rules (a good tablet/headphones really are your best friend in survival mode.&#8221; &#8211; Elyse Renouf</p>



<p>“Block off dedicated family time and actually stick to it.” &#8211; Jessica Kwok</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12738" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-1024x807.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-300x237.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-768x606.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2-960x757.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/05183258/Parents2.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Photo Credit: Sammie Chan (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=enhttps://www.instagram.com/sammiechn/?hl=en">@sammiechn</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>



<p>For parents deciding to use their extra time to upskill, taking some ‘me time’ is all the more important. Pastorin did this by dedicating one evening of the week to himself. “Every Tuesday evening was my time to go out and refresh the brain with something completely unrelated to work.”<br></p>



<p>Kwok started a workout group, initiated a Zoom workout group with a few friends to keep each other accountable for a 30-minute workout, three times a week.</p>



<p>Whatever shape your ‘me time’ takes, don’t put it on the back burner! Even super parents need a break.</p>



<h2>What Comes Next</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the specific needs of a person’s demanding day-to-day are different for everyone. But these incredible parents are proof that if you are determined, committed, and perhaps a little crafty, you can achieve your goals with your family and future in mind.</p>

<p><em>Global leader in digital skills training enters agreement to acquire South Florida’s leading coding and UX design bootcamp, further expanding its reach and offerings.</em></p>



<p><strong>NEW YORK, NY</strong> &#8212; BrainStation, the global leader in digital skills training, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire <a href="https://wyncode.co/">Wyncode</a>, Florida’s leading coding and user experience (UX) design bootcamp. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>



<p>With the acquisition, BrainStation takes on a leadership position in the Florida digital skills training market, offering a suite of full-time bootcamps including Web Development, UX Design, Data Science, and Digital Marketing.</p>



<p>“Acquiring Wyncode is a strong and strategic step to expanding the BrainStation business, and will accelerate our mission to reshape the future of digital skills training across the country,” said Jason Field, Founder and CEO of BrainStation. “Wyncode has been an integral part of Miami’s fast-growing tech industry and Wyncode’s founders and leaders have built deep relationships in the community.”</p>



<p>Founded in 2014 by Johanna and Juha Mikkola, Wyncode Academy has graduated nearly 1,000 students while establishing itself as the premier provider of digital skills training in Florida. It was the first coding bootcamp to be licensed by the Florida Department of Education’s Commission for Independent Education and has won numerous industry awards.</p>



<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to become part of BrainStation’s global mission,” said Wyncode’s CEO Johanna Mikkola, who will join BrainStation. “Seven years ago, we set out to solve Miami’s tech talent gap and reinvent how digital skills were learned in the Miami community. Becoming a part of BrainStation is a transformational next step. It will allow us to have a greater impact and reach more learners than ever before as well as support the community through job creation and tech talent development,” Mikkola said.</p>



<p>Miami’s tech industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with South Florida becoming a new hub for the digital economy. Demand for digital skills is greater than the supply of qualified employees, and that skills gap is growing. The World Economic Forum estimates that more than half of all employees will require significant reskilling by 2022, with emerging technologies generating 133 million new jobs.</p>



<p>“BrainStation’s expansion into Miami underscores the tremendous progress our city has made as a global tech hub. The quality of tech talent and the caliber of employers in South Florida are both on the rise, and we are thrilled to see BrainStation’s investment in our region and community in order to build on the foundation Wyncode has created here,” said Francis Suarez, Mayor of Miami.</p>

<p>BrainStation was advised by Duane Morris and Wyncode was advised by Carlton Fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that CourseCompare has named BrainStation the <a href="https://www.coursecompare.ca/best-coding-bootcamps/?utm_source=BSTNblog&amp;utm_medium=blog_CourseCompare&amp;utm_campaign=WD_BestCodingBootcamp">Best Coding Bootcamp for 2021</a>.</p>



<p>CourseCompare is a leading marketplace for digital education, designed to help professionals identify and pursue the most in-demand job skills. Since 2018, CourseCompare has helped more than 500,000 people worldwide pursue new digital skills or launch new careers in business, technology, and design. </p>



<p>To compile its annual rankings for Best Coding Bootcamp, CourseCompare focused on job placement rates as a key metric, while also considering the following performance metrics:</p>



<ul><li>Verified ratings from recent graduates</li><li>Industry recognition and satisfaction from employer feedback</li><li>Graduate earning potential, based on salaries within six months of graduation</li><li>Graduation rates taken from a variety of regulatory sources</li></ul>



<p>“We interviewed bootcamp founders and recent graduates, pored over job placement data, took a deep dive into the curriculum, and toured campuses across the country to determine which coding bootcamps are truly delivering a positive return on investment (ROI) for their students in 2021,” CourseCompare noted on their website.</p>



<h2>What Sets BrainStation Apart</h2>



<p>According to CourseCompare, “BrainStation’s LMS (Learning Management System), Synapse, is among the most sophisticated on offer in Canada. The live online learning platform allows students to attend live lectures, collaborate with other professionals, and get immediate feedback from instructors — wherever they are.”</p>



<p>Professionals from over 90 countries have now taken courses and programs at BrainStation, and we continue to welcome and attract new professionals from around the world. In 2020, we met a surge in demand for online training by introducing over 350 new online live courses in multiple time zones.</p>

<h2>What Students Are Saying</h2>



<p>BrainStation’s team of 450 industry professionals has trained over 100,000 professionals around the world. We’re honored to have positively impacted the lives of professionals looking to contribute to the world through technology and innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few samples of alumni reviews from CourseCompare on BrainStation’s Web Development Bootcamp.</p>



<p>“I found the collaborative, hands-on teaching approach allowed me to learn in 12 weeks what would have taken me six months to a year.” &#8211; <strong>Jonny Caron</strong></p>



<p>“I took BrainStation&#8217;s Web Development course. I&#8217;m currently a UX Product Designer and thought it would be great to learn more about how my designs are actually coded and implemented by the team I work with&#8230;Both instructors were super knowledgeable and approachable in the online format, I frequently was able to get one-on-one time to answer questions…” &#8211; <strong>Amber Sewell</strong></p>



<p>“BrainStation has made me a more confident person and has helped me find what I really want to do with my career path. The culture in the classroom is unlike the culture I&#8217;ve experienced in traditional schooling &#8211; everyone is a lot more supportive of one another and not only focused on their own progression. I learned how to learn quickly and apply quickly &#8211; a lasting skill that will definitely be beneficial in the web dev industry in the long run.” &#8211; <strong>Jessica Kwok</strong></p>



<p>“I have nothing but the utmost respect for the entire BrainStation team and I cannot thank them enough for the most amazing educational experience I’ve ever had.” &#8211; <strong>Patrick Isaac</strong><br><br></p>
