								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve talked about the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/2018-in-review-nycs-tech-industry-makes-it-big/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of New York’s tech scene, but 2019 might prove to be a pivotal year in the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/is-new-york-now-the-worlds-best-tech-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city’s emerging status as a global tech </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">leader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the holidays approaching, we decided to take a look back at the past 12 months in the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the things we learned from the biggest New York tech industry stories and developments from 2019.</span></p>
<h2><b>Government Continues to Support Tech and AI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York’s municipal and state governments continue to proactively foster growth and entrepreneurship into 2019. For starters, this summer Mayor Bill de Blasio awarded microgrants to seven joint ventures that specialize in workforce development – particularly those that support New Yorkers underrepresented in tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grants total $550K and awardees are expected to deliver a “mix of actionable blueprints for employers and training providers, focused recommendations to policymakers and funders, and specific programming ideas.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10235" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10235" class="size-medium wp-image-10235" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett-300x300.jpeg" alt="James Patchett, President and CEO at New York City Economic Development Corporation" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett-109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/James-Patchett.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10235" class="wp-caption-text">James Patchett, President and CEO at the <span style="font-weight: 400;">NYCEDC</span></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city is also involved in finding a home for a new Artificial Intelligence center and has invested $7 million into the development of AI technology. These initiatives are intended to help put the city at the forefront of this emerging sector, which, according to the EDC, has seen a 678 percent increase in job postings since 2013, with 12,000 job postings for AI-related positions in New York City in 2018 alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Startup Genome’s report found that New York boasted the highest percentage of AI and machine-learning job positions in a single U.S. metro area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to see record levels of investment and growth in this sector, it’s critical that we establish structures and tools that ensure innovation happens responsibly,”  said James Patchett, President and CEO of the </span><a href="https://www.nycedc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Economic Development Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NYCEDC). “The NYC Center for Responsible AI does just that; fostering collaboration and focusing efforts on creating solutions that build trust in the way these transformative technologies are used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the year, the NYCEDC and CIV:Lab, a nonprofit dedicated to connecting urban tech leaders, announced the launch of The Grid, a partnership network for New York’s urban tech community. The network launched with more than 70 member organizations and aims to foster collaboration between businesses, academics, and local tech leaders. The Grid is an expansion of NYCEDC’s UrbanTech NYC program, which has helped establish a number of innovation hubs in the city, including New Lab, Urban Future Lab, and Company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NYCEDC also broke ground on “Zero Irving,” a 240,000-square-foot, $250 million tech center in Union Square. Once completed, Zero Irving will feature a training center, incubator, collaborative workspaces, event space, and a food hall.  </span></p>
<div id="attachment_10234" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10234" class="size-large wp-image-10234" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving-1024x919.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="919" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving-1024x919.jpeg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving-300x269.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving-768x689.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving-960x861.jpeg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/zero-irving.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10234" class="wp-caption-text">Zero Irving rendering.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toward the end of the year, New York invested an additional $4 Million to its $20 million CUNY 2X Tech initiative, which intends to double the number of tech-qualified graduates by 2022. Since launching in 2017, CUNY 2x Tech has helped train over 1,000 students and increased graduate job connection rates by 21 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In just two years, more than 1,000 New York City students have already taken the first steps on their road to a tech career, and by increasing our investment in CUNY 2x Tech, hundreds more will be able to stay put and find a fulfilling job in one of the country&#8217;s biggest tech hubs,&#8221; said Mayor de Blasio.</span></p>
<h2><b>Funding Keeps Growing (and Growing)</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 was a big year for funding in New York, which solidified its position as the number two venture capital ecosystem behind San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, 2018 saw a record-setting $14.25 billion in venture investment, which represented a 91 percent increase over the $7.46 billion generated just four years earlier. This has continued to grow in 2019. As of October, roughly $16.83 billion worth of VC deals were already completed.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10236" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UiPath.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10236" class="size-medium wp-image-10236" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UiPath-300x225.jpeg" alt="Daniel Dines, Founder and CEO of UiPath " width="300" height="225" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UiPath-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UiPath-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UiPath-705x529.jpeg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10236" class="wp-caption-text">Daniel Dines, Founder and CEO of UiPath</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was led by some very big numbers: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, UiPath, a robotics process automation startup now valued at $7 billion, raised a $568 million Series D funding round. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, Dataminr, which specializes in data mining software, closed a $392 million Series E funding round at a valuation of $1.6 billion. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, real-estate giant Compass brought in $370 million in funding in July 2019, raising its valuation to $6.4 billion. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Nuvation Bio Inc., a biotechnology company developing oncological therapies, closed a $275 million Series A financing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capsule Corp., an online pharmacy startup raised $200 million and plans to expand to other cities across the U.S.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazingly, there’s still a sense that venture funding in New York can keep growing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think that we have seen the apex of it at the moment—I think it continues to grow,” </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-in-nyc-the-investors-and-deals-shaping-the-citys-startup-scene"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eric Hippeau, Managing Partner at Lerer Hippeau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I look at the early-stage pipeline, where we are mostly focused on, the number of companies that are looking for funding continues to grow, maybe 20-25 percent every year,” Hippeau said, and he would know. Lerer Hippeau is New York&#8217;s most active venture capital firm, having closed 482 deals since 2010, 287 of which are based in the New York Metropolitan area. </span></p>
<h2><b>NYC is Standing on the Shoulders of (Tech) Giants </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBRE reported that tech company office leasing in Manhattan accounted for roughly 15 percent of the 15 million square feet of office space leased in New York in the first half of 2019. This represented a 10 percent increase from the overall amount of tech office space leased in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook announced in September that it planned to double its headcount in New York City, hiring more than 3,000 people over the next three to five years. To do so, they needed more space, so they signed a lease for over 1.5 million square feet, spread across the 30, 50, and 55 Hudson Yards office towers. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_10242" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10242" class="wp-image-10242 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920-1024x683.jpg" alt="Hudson Yards" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920-960x640.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/vessel-4607227_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10242" class="wp-caption-text">Hudson Yards</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the largest real estate transactions for Facebook, which opened its first New York offices in 2007. The company currently has close to a million square feet of office space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Amazon may have backed out of </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/amazon-in-new-york-why-the-break-up-is-for-the-best"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their HQ2 plans in Long Island City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they are still bullish on the Big Apple it seems. The company last week signed a lease for 335,000 square feet of office space in the Hudson Yards neighborhood. Amazon is believed to be moving 1,500 employees to the property in 2021 once it has been redeveloped. This isn’t quite the 25,000 jobs their HQ2 plan was forecast to create, but opponents of that incentive-heavy plan were still celebrating the announcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Won’t you look at that: Amazon is coming to NYC anyway – without requiring the public to finance shady deals, helipad handouts for Jeff Bezos, and corporate giveaways,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted when news of the announcement broke. When this was, predictably, met with a barrage of criticism, she responded with another tweet: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 25,000 jobs figure was a 10-20 year fantasy number from Amazon, not a promise or agreement. In exchange for that lack of commitment, they wanted billions of public dollars. Their Y1 jobs projection was 700,” she wrote. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en" style="text-align: center;">Me waiting on the haters to apologize after we were proven right on Amazon and saved the public billions <a href="https://t.co/AC64pG0nZI">https://t.co/AC64pG0nZI</a> <a href="https://t.co/xzCepkX4AV">pic.twitter.com/xzCepkX4AV</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1203093051859750912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2019</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple has also been eyeing Hudson Yards. According to The Real Deal, the company is looking for anywhere from 200- to 750,000-square-feet of office space across Manhattan. Other potential locations include the Farley Post Office redevelopment and One Madison Avenue. That kind of massive real-estate expansion would also seem to indicate that the company will be ramping up its hiring efforts in NYC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, Google finalized a lease for 1.8 million square feet of space in the redevelopment of the St. John’s Terminal in Hudson Square. The company has also taken over the Chelsea market and has 300,000 square feet on Eighth Avenue, which they ended up buying for $1.77 billion. They are also leasing 240,000 square feet of office space at Vornado’s 85 10th Avenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We attract a full slate of talent,” said Google Vice President of Engineering Aparna Pappu, explaining the company’s growing NYC footprint. “If you work in just Silicon Valley, you limit who you can attract there. And I think there are companies that have showed that it&#8217;s possible,&#8221; </span></p>
<h2><b>New York Might Be the World’s Most Innovative City</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2019, New York took first place on the Innovation Cities Index, a list of the world’s most innovative cities. The index looks at more than 100 key indicators, including transport, infrastructure, property prices, and startup office spaces, among others. New York ranked particularly strong in smart technology and startups, and with that, it was able to beat out Tokyo, which took the top spot last year, as well as London, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government initiatives mentioned above have helped bolster the startup scene, with New York’s media accelerator program, Combine, supporting the launch of startups like Canairy, Swift, and Vett.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, wildly successful companies aren’t anomalies anymore. Startups valued at over $1 billion are increasingly common in New York City. In 2019, seven startups in New York claimed Unicorn status, including Gympass, Away, Casper, Lemonade, and Glossier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year also saw a surge of startup IPOs, some successful, others not so much. Lyft, Compass, and Rent the Runway made big public splashes. WeWork, meanwhile, became a cautionary tale for startups that reach the sun too quickly. Some forecast that Peloton will likely go public next year, but it’s probably too soon to tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more successful startups comes more job opportunities. Already, the city’s 100 biggest local tech companies employ more than 38,000 people according to Built in NYC. New research in 2019 showed that </span><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/future-workforce/nyc-tech-hiring?linkId=100000009123988"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of companies plan to increase hiring new tech talent. In fact, 66 percent of companies with more than 1 billion in revenue are looking to fill tech roles in 2020. The good news is, these companies believe they can find that talent in New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, New York took was also named the top tech city in the world by a report from UK-based real estate firm Savills, and much of it was down to the city’s abundance of digital skills training opportunities and its ability to attract the best of the best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New York can keep generating its own talent,” </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-02-04/new-york-beats-out-san-francisco-to-be-world-s-best-tech-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paul Tostevin, Author of the Savills report. “And I think more importantly, recruiting it from around the world.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been unthinkable even a decade ago, but after years of rapid economic growth in the Big Apple, we can now make the argument that New York has surpassed Silicon Valley as the best tech city in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, New York overtook San Francisco to rank No. 1 in the Savills Tech Cities index, which evaluates global tech hotspots in 100 individual metrics in categories, including business environment, tech environment, city buzz and wellness, talent pool, real estate costs, and mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New York is our No. 1 tech city and boasts a diverse range of talent from the financial and retail sectors to support its technological offering,” read the report. “Prices may be high, but the opportunities are great: world-renowned universities, a business-focused culture and global links make New York attractive for start-ups and multinationals alike.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year also marked the first time that KPMG’s annual Global Technology Industry Innovation Survey found more than half of respondents predicting that Silicon Valley would no longer be the technology innovation center of the world in four years. In a separate question, tech industry leaders tabbed New York as the most likely to be named top tech hub by 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The belief that Silicon Valley will be displaced as the leading hub underscores the continuing decentralization of technology innovation, spurred by investment in other cities and regions globally, as well as contributing factors in Silicon Valley,” </span><a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/media/press-releases/2019/02/majority-of-global-tech-industry-leaders-expect-silicon-valley-to-be-surpassed-as-tech-innovation-center-kpmg-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tim Zanni, KPMG Global and U.S. Technology Leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a closer look at why many feel New York has already cemented its status as the tech capital of the world.</span></p>
<h2><b>NYC Is a Leader in VC Activity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capital (VC) activity has risen higher and higher across the U.S. in recent years, but no other city matches the rate of funding growth in New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third-quarter 2019 Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor found that New York has seen a record 17 percent of deal value year-to-date, while Startup Genome’s 2019 Global Startup Ecosystem Report ranked New York as the second-highest performing ecosystem with $641,000 early-stage funding per startup and $6 billion early-stage funding total.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, New York grew from just over $2 billion in total deal value in 2010 to a record-setting $14.25 billion in 2018. And Pitchbook’s numbers show that 2019 is poised to take the cake, with roughly $15.63 billion worth of VC deals already in the books as of September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major 2019 deals include the $568 million Series D funding round for UiPath, a robotics process automation startup, as well as the data mining software startup Dataminr closing a $392 million Series E round at a valuation of nearly $1.6 billion, more than double its 2015 valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts argue that VC funding in New York hasn’t even approached a plateau yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think that we have seen the apex of it at the moment—I think it continues to grow,” Lerer Hippeau Managing Partner Eric Hippeau </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-in-nyc-the-investors-and-deals-shaping-the-citys-startup-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;If I look at the early-stage pipeline, where we are mostly focused on, the number of companies that are looking for funding continues to grow, maybe 20-25 percent every year.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locally based firms like Lerer Hippeau are a big reason for that continued concentration of funding in NYC. Lerer Hippeau’s New York-based investments make up more than 59 percent of its business over the past decade, including such successful startups as Casper, Blade, Glossier, and Warby Parker.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lerer-hippeau-founders.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-10072 aligncenter" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lerer-hippeau-founders.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lerer-hippeau-founders.jpg 680w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lerer-hippeau-founders-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, RRE Ventures closed 209 local deals over the past decade – 59 percent of its total deals – while roughly 50 percent of Boxgroup’s deals were in companies based in New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We live in the community, we understand where the challenges are, and we are equipped to help companies with issues,” Hippeau said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also been a rise in big-money exits. In 2018, there were 110 VC-backed exits in New York City worth a combined $9.4 billion. Five years prior in 2013, there were also 110 exits – but their combined value was only $4.3 billion. This year, Datadog’s $100 million IPO was deemed one of the best IPOs in years, while local startups Peloton and WeWork also had blockbuster IPOs (even if both have since been surrounded by some uncertainty).</span></p>
<h2><b>A Startup Scene Like No Other</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the reason so much VC funding has been focused on New York is simple: NYC is home to some amazing companies and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation’s recent Global Startup Ecosystems Report, the city is now the world’s second highest performing ecosystem with 7,000 startups, 326,000 jobs, and over $71 billion in value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s one area where New York’s tech industry is unmatched: its diversity of industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York’s startup success stories span all industries, with notable companies including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer engagement platform Braze, which was listed by CB Insights as one of 50 worldwide companies on a path to a $1 billion valuation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct-to-consumer beauty company Glossier, which is sitting pretty after a $100 million Series D funding round in March 2019 lifted its valuation to $1.2 billion </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-estate giant Compass, which brought in $370 million in fresh funding in July 2019 to raise its valuation to $6.4 billion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-in-one wedding planning platform Zola, which was pegged at a $600 million valuation in February</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second-hand marketplace app </span><a href="https://us.letgo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letgo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which announced a $500 million investment from Naspers in August 2018 to lift its valuation to a reported $1.5 billion</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few examples of thriving New York startups, but NYC companies are making a difference across all industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup Genome’s report found that New York boasted the highest percentage of A.I. and machine-learning job positions in a single U.S. metro area, while the local cybersecurity industry spanned more than 100 companies with over 6,000 employees. The life sciences sub-sector is likewise healthy thanks to New York’s nine academic medical centers, more than 50 hospitals and 100-plus research foundations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that New York is the center of economic activity in the U.S., it’s also not surprising that the fintech industry is booming; KPMG’s Pulse of Fintech 2018 report found that American fintech companies received $52.5 billion in investment last year, with the top deals found mostly in New York, headlined by HIS Markit’s $1.9 billion takeover of the market intelligence, data, and technology solutions firm Ipreo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, the robust local retail industry and the city’s unique energy has created an ecosystem for fashion, lifestyle and beauty startups unlike any other, and some other thriving startups in that sphere include beauty subscription service Birchbox, shaving supply service Harry’s, gift emporium UncommonGoods, and online eyewear retailer Warby Parker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no other place Warby Parker could exist,” Co-founder and Co-CEO Neil Blumenthal </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180226/FEATURES/180229939/new-york-is-the-tech-sector-s-official-second-city-and-the-boom-is-just-beginning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crain’s New York Business. “We are at the intersection of the tech startup world, the fashion world, the retail world, and the social enterprise world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just tech companies offering tech jobs, either. In fact, there are twice as many technology jobs in non-tech industries in New York as there are in technology companies, according to Emsi, a labor market research firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That robust mix of industries has a way of attracting smart people; a survey by Accenture and Tech:NYC backed this up, finding that 74 percent of respondents believe that New York’s diversity of industry will enable tech companies to attract top talent.</span></p>
<h2><b>Local Talent Pool Is Unmatched</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s 100 biggest local tech companies currently employ more than 38,000 people according to Built in NYC, and 80 percent of those organizations planned to expand last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The main resource in technology is smart people,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/technology/nyc-tech-startups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kevin Ryan, a longtime tech entrepreneur. “The New York tech sector is succeeding largely because New York is succeeding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in fact, it was the fertile market for talent that lifted New York to the top spot in the Savills survey, with the abundance of world-renowned universities and innovative digital skills training organizations – including BrainStation – helping to turn out skilled, motivated graduates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So much of it is talent,” </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-02-04/new-york-beats-out-san-francisco-to-be-world-s-best-tech-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paul Tostevin, Author of the Savills report. “New York can keep generating its own talent and, I think more importantly, recruiting it from around the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth pointing out another area where New York excels: female leadership. According to Startup Genome’s report, only Chicago and the mid-east region of Ireland globally have a higher share of female founders, and New York’s 22-24 percent share of female founders is significantly ahead of other tech hotbeds including Silicon Valley (16 percent), London (15 percent), and Seattle (8 percent).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have a pipeline of more endeavoring females that have moved (to New York) for other reasons and then discover entrepreneurship,” </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/vc-in-nyc-the-women-making-it-happen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dayna Grayson, a Partner at New Enterprise Associates, as she explained the discrepancy between New York and San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People move to the Bay Area usually because they want to work in tech or they’re working in tech already. People who live in New York and other places outside Silicon Valley are more likely to discover entrepreneurship and not be looking for it.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Robust Government Support</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth pointing out that New York’s tech surge might not have been possible if not for the concerted efforts of various levels of government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the New York Works plan, a series of 25 initiatives that the city hoped would create 100,000 jobs in emerging fields, including cybersecurity (30,000 jobs), life sciences and healthcare (15,000 jobs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That movement also included ambitious plans to position New York as cybersecurity’s global hub, with a $30 million investment in training, academic R&amp;D labs, and the first business “accelerator” dedicated to early-stage cybersecurity firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the city’s “We are Made in NY” campaign, launched in 2013, provides access to subsidized office space, funding through NYC Seed, training grants, and opportunities to bid on government contracts. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/made-in-ny.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10075" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/made-in-ny.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/made-in-ny.jpg 900w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/made-in-ny-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/made-in-ny-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City Economic Development Corporation has announced in recent years that the city would provide up to $100 million to build the Applied Life Sciences Hub while also pitching in $17 million for the launch of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s new JLabs biotech incubator at the New York Genome Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also worth mentioning the importance of Cyber NYC, a $100 million public-private investment that has the goal of catalyzing 10,000 good jobs and securing New York’s spot as a global hub of cybersecurity innovation. Those plans spanned the 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Security Center in Chelsea, the 50,000-square-foot international cybersecurity investment hub named Hub NYC in Soho, as well as several partnerships with educational institutions to turn out more cybersecurity-savvy workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further to that end, the state’s 2018 budget committed $30 million over five years to K-12 computer science education, teacher training, new academic standards, and supporting gender parity in the tech sector.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Tech Leaders Keep Expanding NYC Footprint</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In KPMG’s </span><a href="https://info.kpmg.us/content/dam/info/en/innovation-enterprise-solutions/pdf/2019/technology-innovation-hubs-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that forecast New York to take Silicon Valley’s top-tech-hub title by 2023, the leaders surveyed pointed to the fact that several tech giants were investing billions in new workspaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As just one example, Google – which set up shop in Chelsea in 2006 – announced a $1 billion investment in a new Hudson Square campus in New York last December, only months after announcing a $2.4 billion purchase of the Manhattan Chelsea Market and sharing plans to lease additional space at Pier 57. With two Hudson Street buildings expected to be ready by 2020 and another in 2022, Google expects that the 7,000 employees it has in New York could be doubled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our investment in New York is a huge part of our commitment to grow and invest in U.S. facilities, offices and jobs,” </span><a href="https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/google-hudson-square-our-expanded-new-york-campus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SVP and CFO Ruth Porat. “In fact, we’re growing faster outside the Bay Area than within it, and this year opened new offices and data centers in locations like Detroit, Boulder, Los Angeles, Tennessee and Alabama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And as we continue to grow across the country, we look forward to calling New York City home for many years to come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giants like Uber and Twitter, of course, have offices in the city too, and despite Amazon dropping Long Island City as “half” of the company’s HQ2, the company did sign leases for more than 400,000 square feet of office space there in 2017 alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Facebook announced in September that it planned to double its headcount in New York City, specifically looking to hire more than 3,000 people over the next three to five years, and other industry giants, including Salesforce and Spotify have 300,000-plus-square-feet footprints in Manhattan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be easy to forget, but Silicon Valley companies lording over massive spaces in New York is a relatively recent trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When California tech giants Google and Facebook first came to New York, they opened tiny offices and hired locals to run ad sales shops,” Greg David and Cara Eisenpress </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180226/FEATURES/180229939/new-york-is-the-tech-sector-s-official-second-city-and-the-boom-is-just-beginning" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Crain’s New York Business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today they house the computer engineers developing the Google cloud and applying artificial intelligence at Facebook in building after building.”</span></p>
<h2><b>It’s New York</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting aside all of the other reasons New York’s tech scene is excelling, it’s worth pointing out that the Big Apple itself offers an unrivaled mix of nightlife, entertainment, world-renowned restaurants, shopping and culture.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10073" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash-1024x769.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="601" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash-768x577.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash-705x529.jpg 705w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/diego-marin-pv_Eo1hoelc-unsplash-960x721.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s that work-and-life balance that’s so important, and that New York can offer that is quite advantageous,” said Tostevin, whose Savills report considered New York’s vibrant way of life in ranking the city No. 1 overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corinna Cortes, a researcher at Bell Labs, was one of Google’s early recruits when Google first began building a research arm in New York. Cortes had two young children, lived in the West Village, enjoyed taking in theater at the Lincoln Center and running trails in Central Park and biking to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She now leads 200 scientists for Google Research in New York, and she can’t imagine living elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no chance I would go to Mountain View,” Cortes </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/technology/nyc-tech-startups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I wasn’t going to live in the suburbs.”</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently explored why New York is drawing </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-venture-capital-keeps-flowing-into-new-york-city"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record amounts of venture capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it seems that influx of funding has led to a boom in PropTech – or property tech – that is sending reverberations throughout the real-estate industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even on a global level, investors have never been more bullish on PropTech. MetaProp’s mid-year 2019 Global PropTech Confidence Index found that investor confidence is at an all-time high at 8.8 out of 10, with startup confidence also at an all-time high of 7.3 out of 10. In addition, 64 percent of PropTech investors planned on making more investments over the next 12 months – also an all-time high, rocketing up from 46 percent a year prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Big Apple is at the center of that activity. Here are eight of the New York startups that are shaking up real estate.</span></p>
<h2><b>Compass</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the mission of helping people find their place in the world, Compass simplifies the real estate process – and in just seven years since launching in 2012, the company has already become the United States’ largest independent real-estate brokerage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to overstate just how successful Compass has been. The startup booked record revenue for three straight months this year – its second-quarter 2019 sales were up 250 percent over the same period a year prior – and $370 million in fresh funding in July 2019 brought its valuation up to $6.4 billion. Compass has now raised more than $1.5 billion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, a company that promises to help users find their dream homes has invested in a&nbsp;beautiful space&nbsp;of its own; its 180,000 square-foot headquarters in Union Square featuring cafes, collaboration zones, a game room, and a rejuvenation lounge.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-9930" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6-1024x767.jpg" alt="Compass office " width="800" height="600" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6-705x529.jpg 705w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6-960x719.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/compass-nyc-hq-6.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>VTS</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by real estate professionals, VTS is touted as the commercial real estate industry’s top leasing and asset management system. VTS’s platforms help landlords maximize portfolio performance with real-time insights – the company’s numbers boast that landlords can convert leads to leases 41 percent faster – while brokers can get their tenants into their new homes quicker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, 10 billion square feet of space are managed on the VTS platform across 35,000 users. With five offices around the world in addition to its global headquarters in New York, VTS received a historic $90 million Series D funding round in May – believed to be the largest-ever for commercial real estate software – that lifted the startup to unicorn status with a $1 billion-plus valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no wonder that VTS CEO and Co-Founder Nick Romito was named Entrepreneur of the Year earlier this year. People love working for VTS, too – it was named one of Crain’s New York Business’s 2018 Best Places to Work in New York City, with the startup being celebrated for its community building, generous paid parental leave policy, on-site coaching, continuing education stipend, flexible work schedules and unlimited paid time off.</span></p>
<h2><b>Reonomy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boasting partnerships with clients including WeWork, Tishman Speyer, Avison Young and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Reonomy is a New York startup that leverages data and technology to make decisions and grow businesses in commercial real estate. Using the Reonomy web app, users can sift through property searches to find the right fit for their business strategy with more than 300 filters including property type, size, sale amount, and ownership information. The company’s enterprise product, meanwhile, is used by companies to clarify and contextualize internal data</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reonomy’s most recent funding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $30 million in June 2018 brought total fundraising up to $68.4 million for the startup, which had rolled out to 3,000 counties and 20,000 municipalities at the time with ambitions of expanding into Canada and Western Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2018 is a tipping point for data in the (commercial real estate) industry,” Reonomy CEO and Co-Founder Richard Sarkis said when the funding was announced. “We’re blown away with how quickly firms are embracing data – and how they’re using Reonomy to fuel greater intelligence, streamline workflows, and create new business opportunities.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Better.com</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has bought a house has likely faced some frustration with the lack of clarity and transparency in securing a mortgage. Better can help. With the goal of making homeownership faster and more accessible, Better offers 24/7 service, honest rate quotes free of hidden fees (backed by a price guarantee), instant loan estimates, an on-demand rate lock feature, and a total lack of commission fees or origination fees.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZ2ZJjA-27g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was created in 2016 after its founder, Vishal Garg, lost a home to an all-cash buyer – while his wife was pregnant with their second child – due to the antiquated mortgage process. He used the money he had saved for a downpayment to launch Better, which is able to close a typical mortgage 50 percent faster than the industry average. The startup also boasts that it saves borrowers more than $3,000 on average in up-front costs on a typical $300,000 loan mortgage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better has become one of the fastest-growing homeownership platforms in the country, on pace to fund more than $4 billion in loans in 2019. A $160 million Series C fundraising round that closed in August 2019 brought Better’s total funding to $254 million to date, and the company expected to hire an additional 400 people by the end of the year. Those new hires can expect a diverse and flexible workplace; Fortune placed Better on its list of the top 60 best companies to work in New York.</span></p>
<h2><b>Updater</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no two ways about it: moving is a pain. And that’s why – as other New York startups help people or companies find or finance the perfect home – Updater tries to take the headaches out of shifting to a new address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation’s leading moving app integrates with thousands of apartment communities, real estate agents and moving companies, it conjures a moving checklist of everything that needs to be done and coordinates with the service providers, retailers, and businesses you’ll need for as smooth a move as possible. On average, the startup says it saves its users five hours, $325 and 21 phone calls and emails, and Updater assists with 3 million-plus moves per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with $97.5 million in total funding over seven rounds, Updater has also become a fixture on lists of the best places to work in New York. That’s not surprising given that perks and benefits include unlimited paid time off, extensive health and dental benefits, company equity, a remote work program, paid volunteer time, a fully stocked kitchen, happy hours, commuter benefits, and regular surprises, including massages, a marching band, and smoothie bars. They even have “onesie days” – as in, yes, pajamas.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updater-onesie-day.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9931" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updater-onesie-day.jpg" alt="Updater onesie day" width="800" height="516" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updater-onesie-day.jpg 1000w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updater-onesie-day-300x194.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updater-onesie-day-768x495.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updater-onesie-day-960x619.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<h2><b>Knotel</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising to make the long-term lease a relic of the past, Knotel designs, constructs, and operates customized and fully furnished office spaces for companies of all sizes so that they have the freedom and space to grow and evolve. Not only does the startup provide sleek and custom-designed spaces tailored to your workplace strategy and brand identity, but Knotel also serves as a single point of contact – eliminating the need to deal with brokers, owners, lawyers, designers, architects, vendors, and movers – for a more efficient journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Knotel is so adept at helping growing companies because of the breakneck speed of its own growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, the flexible workspace provider completed a $400 million financing round in August 2019 to bring its total fundraising to $560 million and boosting its valuation north of $1 billion. Knotel has now grown to more than 4 million square feet across more than 200 locations around the world.</span></p>
<h2><b>Perch</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a stressful dilemma for homeowners eyeing a new place: you’ve found your next dream home, but you risk missing out because you haven’t sold your current place. Enter Perch, a home-buying and selling platform that gives customers a market-price cash offer for your existing house so you can buy contingency-free before you sell, then pays you the difference if your home ultimately sells for more than your initial cash offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though younger than some of the startups on this list – Perch was founded in September 2017 – there are encouraging signs that the startup is on the right track. Perch raised $220 million in a combination of equity ($20 million) and debt ($200 million, to finance home purchasing) in April 2019, particularly impressive considering that its listings are currently limited to three cities in Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perch also offers e-closing and e-notary services so its customers can complete transactions wherever they are, and co-founder and CEO Court Cunningham has said the company eventually plans to offer its own mortgage brokerage service.</span></p>
<h2><b>Rhino</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With rent prices soaring in many big cities in North America Rhino seeks to help renters reduce their upfront move-in costs, both for people and businesses. Instead of forcing tenants to cough up thousands of dollars in upfront security deposits and prepaid rent, Rhino offers lease protection in the form of customizable monthly payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup reports that spaces rent 30 percent faster with its streamlined system, and its plans typically cost less than 1 percent of the monthly rent. Landlords don’t have to worry, either – owners are reimbursed instantly for excessive damage and unpaid rent, and residents pay Rhino back only if they’re at fault.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup just announced in October 2019 that it had raised $21 million Series A, along with a policy plan to lower housing costs in America by $45 billion over the next two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing to like about the company? Rhino has a documented equal-pay policy, as well as medical, dental and vision benefits, unlimited time off, and a remote work program.&nbsp; </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to believe given the breakneck growth in the Big Apple, but New York City’s tech scene continues to boom&#8230;and its homegrown startups are playing a huge role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, New York’s startup scene has grown from $2.3 billion total invested in 2012 to more than $13 billion in 2018. According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation’s recent Global Startup Ecosystems Report, the city is now the world’s second highest performing ecosystem with 7,000 startups, 326,000 jobs, and over $71 billion in value. And Silicon Valley may now </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-new-york-is-poised-to-surpass-silicon-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be in sight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s 100 biggest local tech companies currently employ more than 38,000 people according to Built in NYC, and 80 percent of those organizations planned to expand last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a deeper look at seven startups leading the New York City tech boom. </span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Peloton</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Peloton’s swift ascension to an international sensation could make your head spin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promising a world-class indoor cycling studio experience that can be accessed anywhere and fit into any schedule, Peloton sells $2,000 spinning bikes that feature a screen that streams recorded and live classes filmed in its New York studio. CEO and co-founder John Foley says the company is “weirdly profitable,” and indeed it saw its value soar to $4.15 billion after a $550 million funding round that the company said would be its last before its expected IPO this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 700 employees already based in New York, the company has plans to continue its rapid growth and has announced that it will relocate to a 312,000-square-foot space at Hudson Commons in 2020. Certainly, Peloton is committed to the Big Apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New York City is where Peloton started, and it will continue to be our home as we scale our business globally,” Foley </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-to-expand-nyc-footprint-with-new-corporate-headquarters-at-hudson-commons-in-2020-300752307.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “As our brand lives at the intersection of fitness, technology and media, this city is where the best talent can be found across all three of those industries.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.braze.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Braze</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A leading customer engagement platform, Braze – formerly known as Appboy – has picked up serious steam in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, the startup – which delivers personalized messaging experiences across push, email, apps and more – announced $80 million Series E funding led by Meritech Capital Partners, meaning that the company hauled in $130 million in just over a year and more than doubled its valuation to $850 million in 2017. Braze delivers tens of billions of messages to more than 1.5 billion monthly active users globally, and the startup can now boast more than 500 customers, including ABC News, AccuWeather, HBO, Lyft, and Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder CB Insights, a firm that tracks start-ups, included Braze on its 2019 list of the 50 companies worldwide on a path to a $1 billion valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 150 of the company’s 300 employees based locally, perks include free daily lunch, medical insurance, tuition reimbursement, a flexible time-off policy and a 401(k) with employer matching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re a crew of smart, talented, hardworking individuals who are as curious as we are informed,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/06/27/nyc-companies-hiring-july-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senior Technical Recruiter Stu Levinson. “We don’t settle. Our culture encourages fresh perspectives, genuine vibes and a deep commitment to excellence.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.dataminr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Dataminr</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A real-time information discovery startup promising to transform vast public social media feeds into the earliest alerts, Dataminr helps industries including corporate security, finance, the news media, and public relations stay on top of breaking news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup officially took on unicorn status after closing a $392 million funding round in June 2018, lifting its valuation to $1.6 billion – more than double its 2015 valuation of $680 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to benefits including health insurance, 401(k) matching, free daily meals and a professional development fund, Dataminr promises its employees – who number roughly 250 locally at the company’s headquarters, located blocks from Grand Central and Penn Station – a diverse, inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When people feel comfortable being their authentic selves, they are more likely to be creative, take bigger risks and perform at higher levels,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/10/24/diversity-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Manager of Technical Recruiting Kenji Porter. “It’s more than creating an environment with people from different backgrounds – it’s also encouraging diversity of thought and empowering everyone to share ideas, participate in initiatives for positive change and make meaningful contributions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m proud to work for a company that values and includes different perspectives in everything we do.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://compass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Compass</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the mission statement of helping everyone find their place in the world, the thriving tech startup Compass aims to simplify the real-estate process – and since launching in 2012, it’s already become the country’s largest independent real-estate brokerage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just in 2018, Compass more than tripled its agent population to over 7,000 and launched in markets including Seattle, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego and Dallas. The company expected to more than double its 2017 sales volume of $14.8 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not surprising that the company has ambitious plans for the future. After closing a $400 million Series F financing round in September 2018 – bringing total capital raised to nearly $1.2 billion – the company announced plans to expand internationally, while also setting the goal of gaining 20 percent market share in the top 20 U.S. cities by 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes sense that a company that promises to help users find their dream homes has invested in a </span><a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2018/05/31/a-look-inside-compass-new-nyc-headquarters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beautiful space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its own; its 180,000 square-foot headquarters in Union Square features cafes, collaboration zones, a game room, and a rejuvenation lounge.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.zola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Zola</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another startup chosen by CB Insights among worldwide companies looking likely for a $1 billion valuation, all-in-one wedding-planning platform Zola has couples and investors alike swooning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founded in 2013 by Shan-Lyn Ma and Nobu Nakaguchi, Zola claims to have reinvented the wedding planning experience to help the soon-to-be-betrothed do everything from create their own website, manage their registry, and stay on top of their guest lists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zola really turned heads with the May 2018 announcement that it had raised $100 million in Series D, bringing its total capital up to $140 million and, as of February 2019, helping to lift the company to a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$600 million valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new funding, Ma said the company would look to grow its share of the market – as well as the headcount of its staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are going to invest in our technology resources and product development in order to fuel innovation,” she </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/05/03/zola-100m-series-d-funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We’re also going to think about mass brand awareness so everybody knows about Zola. Also, we’re hiring!”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://us.letgo.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>letgo</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you think your old stuff was worthless? Think again: letgo has proven that there’s a ton of cash to be made in the second-hand marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billed as the biggest and fastest-growing app to buy and sell locally, letgo – which, surprisingly given how much money it’s raised, was only founded in 2015 – has taken the world by storm, with 100 million downloads, 400 million listings and 6 billion messages swapped by users as of </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180808005445/en/letgo-Receives-500M-New-Funding-Commitment-Naspers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was also the month letgo announced a staggering $500 million investment from Naspers and although the company isn’t disclosing valuation, that round reportedly raised it above $1.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has earmarked that influx of funding for product evolution, expansion into new verticals and, of course, growth – and for job-seekers intrigued by the fast-rising company, the startup looks for people who enjoy problem-solving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look for candidates who want to build something impactful and that people love using because it makes their lives simpler,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2018/06/27/nyc-companies-hiring-july-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Director of People Operations Natalia Harris. “We hire people who are excited by challenges rather than intimidated by them.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.glossier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Glossier</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the direct-to-consumer beauty company Glossier, the future sure looks pretty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by Emily Weiss, the company now has more than 200 employees across three offices and operates in the U.S., Canada and several countries in Europe. Its annual revenue more than doubled in 2018 while landing more than 1 million new customers. A $100 million Series D funding round in March 2019 lifted its valuation to $1.2 billion and locked in its unicorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Named one of the 50 most sought-after startups in the U.S. by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2018-50-most-sought-after-us-daniel-roth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Glossier also boasts a gorgeous office space – worthy of its super-popular </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/glossier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – where every conference room is named after an inspiring woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weiss even calls their headquarters her favorite place to be in New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are born out of an editorial site, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Into the Gloss</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and everyone here gets inspired by building creative spaces that are very out in the open,” she </span><a href="https://www.mydomaine.com/emily-weiss-glossier-office-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We have a great communal space here with sofas, so everyone can come hang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thinking behind the design of this area is making as many creative spaces as possible in a company.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help, we’ve put together the following guide to one of the fastest-growing tech hubs in the entire world. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Tech Market</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perception with “tech” jobs is that they are usually limited to app makers and funky startups, but that’s no longer based in reality. As we’ve pointed out, </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-growing-industries-in-new-york-looking-for-tech-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major industries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like manufacturing and health are now in need of tech talent and skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an overview of the New York industries you should explore if you want to pursue a career in tech. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York has made a $100 million public-private investment in Cyber NYC, an initiative that aims to create 10,000 jobs and transform the city into a global, cyber innovation leader. Those plans include a 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Security Center in Chelsea; a 50,000-square-foot cybersecurity investment hub in Soho, and partnerships with local educational institutions to create cybersecurity-savvy workers. Read more about the local cybersecurity industry </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-growing-industries-in-new-york-looking-for-tech-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health Tech</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From cancer diagnosis to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-can-help-diagnose-and-treat-mental-illness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment, data and AI are being used to innovative and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/how-ai-is-changing-the-future-of-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improve healthcare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Data, in particular, is helping to build complex classification systems that will streamline and improve diagnostics across the board. New York counts a number of health tech companies that are leading the charge for this kind of technological usage, including WW, Cityblock Health, Crossix, Cedar, and more. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinTech</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City remains firmly in the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-growing-industries-in-new-york-looking-for-tech-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lead of the fintech scene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. KPMG’s Pulse of Fintech 2018 report found that American fintech companies received $52.5 billion in investment last year, with the top deals still mostly in New York. Leading the way was HIS Markit’s $1.9 billion takeover of the market intelligence, data, and technology solutions firm Ipreo, as well as SS&amp;C’s $1.5 billion takeover of secure document sharing and collaboration platform Intralinks.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-growing-industries-in-new-york-looking-for-tech-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biotech</span></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than 300 venture firms investing in healthcare with headquarters or dedicated offices in New York City, and this is having an impact. According to the New York City Healthcare Venture Capital Report, 79 NYC-based healthcare companies received $703 million in funding in 2017. Those numbers – encouraging as they were – were blown out of the water in 2018, which began with Roche’s record-setting $1.9 billion acquisition of digital health analytics startup Flatiron Health, the largest tech acquisition in New York history.</span></p>
<h3><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/5-growing-industries-in-new-york-looking-for-tech-talent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D modeling </span></a></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York’s 3D printing community is considered the largest in the world. According to July 2016 data from 3D Hubs, New York was home to 3,739 makers and 516 3D printers, far ahead of second-place L.A., and third-place London. Leading companies include Shapeways, 3D Brooklyn, 3D Hubs, and Voodoo Manufacturing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Tech Companies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Built in NYC, the city’s 100 biggest local tech companies currently employ more than 38,000 people, and 80 percent of them planned to expand in 2018. As these companies grow, the city is giving “</span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-new-york-is-poised-to-surpass-silicon-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">established tech destinations a run for their money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, New York City has grown from $2.3 billion invested in startups in 2012 to more than $13 billion in 2018. And according to the Global Startup Ecosystems Report from the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the city is now the world’s second highest performing ecosystem with 7,000 startups, 326,000 jobs, and over $71 billion in value. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City&#8217;s tech sector now encompasses more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">326,000 jobs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its startup ecosystem is valued at more than $71 billion, and its tech workers’ average salary of $147,300 dwarfs the citywide average of $89,100.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with all that success, the one problem keeping executives in the City That Never Sleeps up at night might be how to find the right talent to fill that abundance of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighty percent of companies in New York City said they planned to hire new tech talent in 2018 according to a survey from Accenture and Tech:NYC, with more than half reporting that they planned to increase their workforce by more than 20 percent. But the survey also found that only half of the respondents expressed confidence in their ability to hire from within the New York innovation ecosystem, and half of all responding companies likewise said they wouldn’t be able to innovate at the same pace without that talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment in New York City’s tech sector increased by 57 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to the State Comptroller, and it wasn’t just tech companies hiring tech workers; the number of tech jobs in non-tech industries </span><a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt4-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased by 31 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So where are the jobs? Here are five growing industries in New York that are particularly hungry for tech talent.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cybersecurity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the cybersecurity industry, New York hasn’t been shy about its ambition – the Big Apple wants to be No. 1 worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order creating the New York City Cyber Command in July 2017, New York has rapidly become a worldwide leader in the rapidly growing industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s commitment didn’t end there, as New York has also made a $100 million public-private investment in Cyber NYC, an initiative aiming to create 10,000 good jobs and transform New York into a global leader in cyber innovation. Those plans span the 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Security Center in Chelsea; the 50,000-square-foot international cybersecurity investment hub named Hub NYC in Soho, as well as several partnerships with local educational institutions to help create more cybersecurity-savvy workers.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_9039" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9039" class="size-full wp-image-9039" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/James-Pachett.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="252"><p id="caption-attachment-9039" class="wp-caption-text">James Pachett, President and CEO of New York City Economic Development Corporation</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cybersecurity has never been more important to the pillars of New York’s economy–sectors like finance, healthcare, media, and technology–and it will only grow more crucial,” </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90245307/nyc-plans-cybersecurity-industry-push-that-could-add-10000-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer. “You only have to open a newspaper to see how vast the need for cybersecurity is today. Investing in this industry is timely, it plays to New York’s strengths, and it will deliver a real return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s already working. The Global Startup Ecosystems Report found that cybersecurity was one of the three fastest startup sub-sectors for growth, which is unsurprising given that cybersecurity generated more than $1 billion in VC investment in New York in 2017 alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, there is no shortage of thriving cybersecurity firms – and therefore a corresponding surplus of jobs – in New York. Among the </span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/09/15/why-new-york-city-is-giving-silicon-valley-a-serious-run-for-its-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cybersecurity companies headquartered in New York, some of the industry leaders include global digital forensics and incident response firm LIFARS, data security and insider threat detection pioneer Varonis, and industrial cyber protection firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bayshore Networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are at a seminal moment in the trajectory of the cybersecurity industry,” </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/business/a-plan-to-turn-new-york-into-a-capital-of-cybersecurity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> James Patchett, President and Chief Executive of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Making New York City the epicenter of cybersecurity makes complete sense because New York City is where all the customers are.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Fintech</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you consider that Wall Street remains the beating heart of American – and even global – finance, it only makes sense that New York’s fintech industry has caught fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, it’s surprising it didn’t happen sooner. A June 2016 report from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accenture</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that for the first time, more fintech venture capital flowed into New York than San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, New York remains firmly in the lead, even as fintech investment surges everywhere. KPMG’s Pulse of Fintech 2018 report found that American fintech companies received $52.5 billion in investment last year, with the top deals found mostly in New York, headlined by HIS Markit’s $1.9 billion takeover of the market intelligence, data, and technology solutions firm Ipreo, as well as SS&amp;C’s $1.5 billion takeover of secure document sharing and collaboration platform Intralinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, it’s a fertile industry for job-seekers, and it’s not just fintech startups that are hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three months of 2018, three of the five companies with the most tech-related job listings on Indeed.com in New York were well-established financial services companies, including BNY Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the New York State Comptroller </span><a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt4-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tech jobs comprise about 11 percent of the entire securities industry. As just one example, Goldman Sachs employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including Data Analysts, App Developers, Digital Security, and Blockchain Experts. </span></p>
<h2><b>Biotech</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a bevy of major recent deals, robust government support and many thriving local companies, it’s clear New York’s biotech and life sciences industry is quite healthy indeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the New York City Healthcare Venture Capital Report, 79 NYC-based healthcare companies received $703 million in funding in 2017 (it helps that there are 300 venture firms investing in healthcare with headquarters or dedicated offices in the city). Those numbers – encouraging as they were – were blown out of the water in 2018, which began with Roche’s record-setting $1.9 billion acquisition of digital health analytics startup Flatiron Health, the largest tech acquisition in New York history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public and private support in this sub-sector has been particularly robust. The aforementioned growth has been powered in part by programs including the Digital Health Breakthrough Network, StartUp Health, ELabNYC, LifeSci NYC, and the New York Digital Health Innovation Lab. The New York City Economic Development Corporation also&nbsp;announced&nbsp;last year the city would provide up to $100 million to build the Applied Life Sciences Hub while also providing $17 million to help with the June launch of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s new&nbsp;JLabs&nbsp;biotech incubator at the New York Genome Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even within New York’s healthtech and life sciences sub-sector, there’s considerable diversity. Consider that some of the city’s top startups have included ZocDoc (which helps to alleviate pain points in the online booking process), online therapy platform Talkspace, or Call9, which aims to help nursing home patients.</span></p>
<h2><b>Manufacturing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until very recently, the manufacturing industry in New York City seemed to be on its last legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city lost an average of 8,370 manufacturing jobs annually between 2001 and 2011. Since then, however, observers have been encouraged by a gradual uptick in manufacturing employment powered less by traditional manufacturers and more by small specialty producers, many of whom do work that is heavily reliant on tech. Further, while the tech manufacturing industry is still in its fledgling stages in New York City, jobs at those companies have </span><a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt4-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased by 36 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area of strength? New York’s 3D printing community, considered the largest in the world. According to July 2016 data from 3D Hubs, New York was home to 3,739 makers and 516 3D printers, far ahead of second-place L.A., and third-place London. Leading companies include Shapeways, 3D Brooklyn, 3D Hubs, and Voodoo Manufacturing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 3D printing market expected to grow to </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/3d-printing-market-worth-3019-billion-usd-by-2022-575392311.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$30.19 billion by 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, New York is uniquely positioned to take advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, advanced manufacturing and robotics startups in New York have seen a </span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/09/15/why-new-york-city-is-giving-silicon-valley-a-serious-run-for-its-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">189 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increase in early-stage funding deals over the past five years. That growth has been bolstered by government initiatives including Brooklyn’s New Lab, a technology center and public-private partnership that hosts over 100 companies, and the Futureworks NYC program, an accelerator of affordable manufacturing spaces that aims to increase local production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Informed by our rich industrial history, the advanced manufacturing sector is leveraging 21st-century technology and creative services to bring production back to New York City,&#8221; Patchett </span><a href="https://www.nycedc.com/press-release/nycedc-announces-rollout-futureworks-nyc-advanced-manufacturing-initiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Futureworks NYC will make this sector more accessible by connecting entrepreneurs with the technology and support they need to grow companies and create new jobs.”</span></p>
<h2><b>eCommerce/Retail Tech/Consumer Tech</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York has always been a shopping mecca – and that’s even truer today, whether the city’s retailers are serving locals or online customers all around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it’s worth considering just how prominent a role New York plays in both the fashion and larger retail industry. According to the Fashion NYC 2020 report, New York houses roughly 900 fashion companies and stands as the largest retail market in the country, generating more than $15 billion in sales annually. That helps to explain why it’s not just eCommerce startups hiring tech workers, either; tech jobs in retail in New York grew by </span><a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/osdc/rpt4-2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between 2010 and 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The robust local retail industry and the city’s unique energy has created an ecosystem for fashion, lifestyle and beauty startups unlike any other, and it’s no wonder then that so many have thrived, including beauty subscription service Birchbox, shaving supply service Harry’s, period-proof underwear maker THINX, gift emporium UncommonGoods, and online eyewear retailer Warby Parker.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_9040" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9040" class="wp-image-9040 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshot-square-13-300x300.png" alt="John Foley, the Founder and CEO of Peloton" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshot-square-13-300x300.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshot-square-13-150x150.png 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshot-square-13-109x109.png 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshot-square-13-100x100.png 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Headshot-square-13.png 532w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9040" class="wp-caption-text">John Foley, the Founder and CEO of Peloton</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no other place Warby Parker could exist,” Co-founder and Co-CEO Neil Blumenthal </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20180226/FEATURES/180229939/new-york-is-the-tech-sector-s-official-second-city-and-the-boom-is-just-beginning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Crain’s New York Business. “We are at the intersection of the tech startup world, the fashion world, the retail world, and the social enterprise world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look to nearly any subcategory of eCommerce, you will find startups thriving in New York. For instance, for food delivery or meal-kit subscription services, NYC has spawned Blue Apron, Try the World, Food52, and Minibar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t end there. Other major success stories include mattress retailer Casper and Peloton, which aims to create an indoor cycling studio experience that can be accessed from anywhere. Peloton </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $550 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;in 2018 to bring its total to $994.7 million in equity funding ahead of its expected IPO this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike Silicon Valley, New York has embraced businesses that marry technology and consumer goods, including my own company, Peloton. Our business could not have been born anywhere else,” Peloton Founder and CEO John Foley </span><a href="https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170209/OPINION/170209882/op-ed-why-new-york-city-s-tech-sector-will-ultimately-surpass-silicon-valley-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And as an aspiring global lifestyle brand, we benefit from our proximity to Fifth and Madison avenues, with its understanding of consumer sensibilities, retail, fashion, advertising, and branding.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a record year of investments and big-money deals in the Big Apple, you might have expected venture capital (VC) activity in New York to stagnate in 2019 – instead, the East Coast tech hotbed has only gotten hotter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter of 2019 saw New York metro-based VC-backed companies raise </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/moneytree-report/moneytree-report-q1-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a 110 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2018, and a massive increase over the $2.7 billion raised over the same quarter in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazingly, this kind of growth is expected to continue. Here are some of the reasons why New York’s VC activity has maintained such a feverish pace.</span></p>
<h2><b>VC Activity Is on the Rise Everywhere</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we’ll get to the ways in which New York’s VC situation is special, it’s worth noting that VC activity is going through the roof across the United States and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a banner year in 2018 for VC funding in the U.S., with a </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-venture-capital-investment-reached-130-9-billion-in-2018--surpassing-dot-com-era-300776071.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record $130.9 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in American startups, surpassing the all-time high in 2000. That staggering number was spread across 8,948 deals. Other numbers were similarly positive, including a 33 percent year-over-year increase in exit value and the highest-yet figure for fundraising, with $55.5 billion raised across 256 deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And experts believe 2019 could be on pace to top those figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/1Q_2019_PitchBook_NVCA_Venture_Monitor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Q 2019 Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the deal count trended downward in the first quarter of the year but larger deals elevated the overall value. Moreover, first-quarter capital investment was the second-highest quarterly total in 10 years (behind only the record-setting fourth quarter of 2018).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most impressive is that 2019 could be poised to surpass 2018 for record exit value, with Uber headlining a series of expected high-profile public offerings.</span></p>
<h2><b>New York Is Outpacing Even That Growth</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first quarter of 2019, the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor found that the Mid-Atlantic region, which includes New York, generated 30 percent of all the deal value of VC dollars – more than double what the region reeled in during the fourth quarter of 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the recent </span><a href="https://www.nycedc.com/press-release/global-startup-ecosystem-report-nyc-home-over-7000-startups-71b-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Startup Ecosystems Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the New York City Economic Development Corporation, New York City is the world’s second highest performing ecosystem with 7,000 startups and over $71 billion in Ecosystem Value. New York grew from $2.3 billion invested in startups in 2012 to approximately </span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-capital-q4-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$13 billion in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the sector now boasts 326,000 jobs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York is also taking a larger and larger share of the country’s overall VC funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, dollars invested in New York represented over 14 percent of all investment dollars in U.S. venture-backed companies. Surprisingly, that share has risen gradually over the past decade, more than tripling 2009’s rate and doubling 2012’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As New York’s piece of the pie has grown, the Bay Area’s has shrunk. Over the first half of 2018, the total number of investments in New York-based companies was almost half that of the Bay Area, compared to only 10 percent in 2006.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just the quantity of investments in New York that’s on the rise, but the average size of investment – it was up to $12 million in the first half of 2018, compared to less than $4 million as recently as 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numbers from </span><a href="http://pitchbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pitchbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that there were only 91 deals greater than $20 million between 2010 and 2013 – through August of 2018, there were already 87 deals of that magnitude.</span></p>
<h2><b>New York’s Startup Scene Continues to Diversify</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early part of the decade, New York’s tech startup landscape was mainly associated with eCommerce (Etsy), social networks (Tumblr, Foursquare) and media (Buzzfeed, Vox). As the ecosystem has matured, New York is now a hub for fintech, biotech, food, cybersecurity, consumer tech, and much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the diversity of 2018’s biggest funding rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peloton – which aims to create an indoor cycling studio experience that can be accessed from anywhere – raised $550 million to bring its total to $994.7 million in equity funding ahead of its IPO this year. Second-hand shopping app Letgo raised $500 million Series E, and real-estate platform Compass brought in $400 million Series F.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variety in New York’s thriving startup scene doesn’t end there. Dataminr – billed as the world’s first real-time information discovery company – closed a $392 million funding round at a $1.6 billion valuation, more than twice its 2015 valuation of $680 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, home buying tool Ribbon announced a $225 million funding round, health insurance company Oscar Health raised $165 million, robotic process automation vendor UiPath raised $153 million in Series B funding – before receiving another $225 million Series C in September – and online startup Harry’s shaving club raised $112 million Series D funding before announcing plans to move beyond the shaving business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Startup Ecosystems Report found that three New York sub-sectors are growing particularly quickly: health and life sciences; advanced manufacturing and robotics; and cybersecurity, a sub-sector that generated more than $1 billion in VC investment in 2017 alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are lucky to have the confluence of existing markets and industries along with the creative culture to drive a truly diverse tech ecosystem,” said Julie Samuels, Executive Director of Tech:NYC.</span></p>
<h2><b>An Improving Environment for Exits and Mergers and Acquisitions</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, the criticism of New York’s tech scene was its relative lack of high-profile IPOs and mergers and acquisitions – despite success stories such as Etsy and Blue Apron – but that has finally changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, 2018 began with a bang as Roche’s acquisition of digital health analytics startup Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion established the largest tech acquisition in New York history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stunningly, that figure was almost matched mere months later when Adtech pioneer AppNexus, a marketplace for digital advertising, was acquired by AT&amp;T for a reported $1.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other big exits in 2018 included Salesforce’s acquisition of AI-powered marketing intelligence platform Datorama was for a reported $800 million and MINDBODY’s acquisition of spa management platform Booker for $150 million in March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also two major acquisitions of New York-based public bicycle and electric bicycle sharing platforms, as  JUMP Bikes was acquired by Uber for a reported $200 million, and just months later Motivate, the company behind Citi Bike, was scooped up by Lyft for a rumored $250 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, all eyes are on WeWork, which announced in April that it confidentially filed IPO registration paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other New York companies that went public recently are also performing well. MongoDB has seen its stock price more than quadruple since going public in October 2017, while digital knowledge management platform Yext has a market cap of $2.37 billion after pricing its April 2017 IPO around a $1 billion valuation, and Etsy similarly has seen its market cap skyrocket to $7.26 billion after a year in which its stock price grew more than 100 percent.</span></p>
<h2><b>Strong Local Early-stage Investors</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York’s thriving startup ecosystem in part owes to the robust venture support provided by a number of local early-stage firms, with some of the most active among them including Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Contour Venture Partners, Greycroft Partners, FirstMark Capital and Female Founders Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other multi-stage investors have also been generous with early-stage investments, including Bessemer Venture Partners, General Catalyst Partners and New Enterprise Associates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, it generally helps that New York stands as the financial capital of the U.S., and the number of VC firms operating locally remains high.</span></p>
<h2><b>A Commitment to Innovation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York didn’t become a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship accidentally, and one of the reasons it’s become such a rich ground for VC investment is the robust government support of the city’s booming tech ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018 alone, several new initiatives were announced to drive further innovation in the country’s largest city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) announced the city would provide up to $100 million to build the Applied Life Sciences Hub while also providing $17 million to help with the June launch of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s new JLabs biotech incubator at the New York Genome Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city announced the NYC Blockchain Resource Center, intended to stand as a physical hub for the industry, and in October opened RLab, the first-ever city-funded virtual and augmented reality lab in the United States. Another tech hub in Union Square received full council approval in August, and in October, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and Cyber NYC – the $100 million public-private investment intended to grow New York’s cybersecurity ecosystem – announced the launch of the Global Cyber Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiatives such as these will help ensure New York’s record-setting VC activity can be sustained in the years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NYC is creating the infrastructure to grow industries of the future,” said Ryan Birchmeier of the NYCEDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This work is focused on ecosystem building that will attract new venture capital investment, grow startups, increase international expansions and create good-paying jobs for New Yorkers.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been two months since Amazon pulled out of its plan to develop part of their HQ2 in Long Island City, and despite attempts to get the company to reconsider, it looks like the deal is officially dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on who you talk to, this is either a huge win for community engagement and future city building or a massive political failure that will have economic repercussions for decades to come. There are, however, a few things we can all agree on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what we learned from Amazon canceling HQ2 in New York, and why it might be for the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>The City&#8217;s Tech Sector is Still Growing (and Fast)</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7954 size-large" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-1024x353.png" alt="New York tech year in review 2018" width="1024" height="353" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-1024x353.png 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-300x103.png 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-768x265.png 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-960x331.png 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-331x115.png 331w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review-1160x400.png 1160w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Zachary_Monteiro_NYC_In_Review.png 2221w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this proves anything, it’s that New York continues to be a big draw. Amazon even felt the need to profess their love when announcing the pull-out, noting the city’s “incomparable dynamism, people, and culture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently wrote about how </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-new-york-is-poised-to-surpass-silicon-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York was poised to surpass Silicon Valley</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and highlighted this dynamism, as well as the city’s diverse industries and workforce. As an example, we quoted Shan-Lyn Ma, the Founder and CEO of Zola, who put it this way: “If you’re in fashion, if you’re in the financial services [&#8230;] or any industry that happens to thrive in New York, then you want to be here, because it’s a 10-minute ride to anyone you would ever want to meet, and you could set up a meeting that morning and meet them that afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sense of being in the center of it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is why so many tech giants have already expanded into New York in the last ten years. Google, Facebook, Uber, and Twitter, for example, all have offices in the city, and despite Amazon backing out of Long Island City, the company still has leases for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 400,000 square feet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of office space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York’s tech industry is now the third-largest component of its economy. It is also the fastest-growing – the city added </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 76,000 technology jobs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last decade. In all, there are now more than 7,500 New York-based tech companies, which employ more than 120,000 people, an increase of 60 percent in 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of the industry, though, may have been part of what doomed the Amazon deal. 238 cities threw their hat in the ring for the company’s HQ2, and the majority would have done just about anything to get the nod, regardless of what Amazon demanded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the numbers above make clear, New York is not like everywhere else. Ultimately, this is why opponents of the deal were so determined to fight it; New York’s economy would have benefited from having Amazon, but it’s already proving that it doesn’t need Amazon. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>The World of Work Is Changing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to estimates, Amazon would have created anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 new jobs over the next decade. If New Yorkers didn’t roll out a massive red carpet, it’s because the world of work is changing quickly, and it’s making many people nervous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/research/digital-skills-survey-2019-results/executive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation’s 2019 Digital Skills Survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 74 percent of organizations are actively involved in digital transformation, and 89 percent claim there are elements of their products and services that did not exist five years earlier. However, nearly half of employees fear change when digital transformation initiatives are introduced, and almost 60 percent are concerned about job security. Considering the change proposed to the city’s workforce and neighborhoods, it’s easy to understand the less-than-enthusiastic response afforded Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Eduardo Porter wrote in the New York Times, “there is a small island of highly educated professionals making good wages at corporations like Intel or Boeing&#8230;that island sits in the middle of a sea of less-educated workers who are stuck at businesses like hotels, restaurants and nursing homes.” </span></p>
<div id="attachment_8699" style="width: 221px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8699" class="wp-image-8699 size-medium" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bill_de_Blasio_2014-211x300.jpg" alt="Bill de Blasio" width="211" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bill_de_Blasio_2014-211x300.jpg 211w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bill_de_Blasio_2014.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8699" class="wp-caption-text">New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use his example, a restaurant worker might not feel very confident about landing one of those specialized positions at Amazon. They might, however, worry about the company’s impact on their neighborhood and the cost of living, especially when it was revealed that Amazon, one of the richest companies in the world, would receive a $3 billion incentive package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to defend the incentives, saying the deal had an “astounding return on investment,” which would create “an unprecedented number of jobs” and turn New York into a five-borough city that did not have to rely on Manhattan. That might have been true, but it was still hard for some to accept, given how tight-fisted the city has been when it comes to funding things like education, affordable housing, and upgrades to the aging subway system – issues that were only magnified by the news that Amazon executives planned on using a helipad as a transportation hub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address these concerns, the company sent a flyer to Queens residents in the new year, touting “</span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-reskilling-is-the-new-hiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">career training for local residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” which included “technology and relevant training that will help New Yorkers be better equipped for Amazon and other potential employment opportunities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a good reason they included this: Around the world, organizations are </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/corporate-training?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=BSTNblog&amp;utm_campaign=8trailblazingmarketingfirmsNYC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reskilling employees to prepare for the future</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to address the anxiety caused by the changing world of work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon evidently understood the importance of skills training for the future but waited too long to address it. Had retraining been a part of the conversation earlier, it may very well have limited some of the opposition to the deal. </span></p>
<h2><b>This Could Have Been Handled Better</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to shake the feeling that this was a poorly managed process. Michael Gianaris, a State Senator who represents Long Island City, said, Amazon “acted like a petulant child” who picked up and left when “a community that was going to be profoundly affected by their presence started asking questions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/amazon-new-york-bill-de-blasio.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, de Blasio echoed the sentiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Put simply: If you don’t like a small but vocal group of New Yorkers questioning your company’s intentions or integrity, prove them wrong. Instead, Amazon proved them right. Just two hours after a meeting with residents and community leaders to move the project forward, the company abruptly canceled it all,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s worth remembering, however, that de Blasio was part of the team that had hammered out the deal in secret, without input from State Senators or city council. The deal even went through a General Project Plan (GPP), instead of the usual Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP), which needs to be voted on by New York City Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its statement, the company did not address this lack of community involvement, and instead put the blame on “a number of state and local politicians,” who they said, “have made it clear that they oppose our presence.” Many took that as a shot at the deal’s most vocal opponents, including Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, who was quick to celebrate the canceled development. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers &amp; their neighbors defeated Amazon’s corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,” she tweeted. She would later defend her stance by picking apart the incentive package, which included a $505 million capital grant and $897 million from the city’s Relocation and Employment Assistance Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was written into the deal that we were going to build a helipad for Amazon. We were actually putting hard capital into helping them build their campus while we’re constantly told that there isn’t enough hard capital to heat the rooms in NYCHA,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, and many of the deal’s critics, had argued that these kinds of investments should be made in infrastructure, education, and training programs, which would diversify the city’s economy and boost entrepreneurialism. Already, the city’s startup ecosystem is valued a $71 billion, the third most valuable in the world, and it’s growing. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York betting on itself may not be as sexy as a brand new tech campus in an underdeveloped part of the city, but given the changing world of work, and the tensions it is creating, it may be what’s needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And really, if you needed a group of people to bet on, who better than New Yorkers? As de Blasio tweeted when the deal fell through, &#8220;You have to be tough to make it in New York City.”</span></p>
