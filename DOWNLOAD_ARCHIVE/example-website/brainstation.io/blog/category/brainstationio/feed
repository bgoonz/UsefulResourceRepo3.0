								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From Social Media and E-Mail Marketing, to reviewing increasingly complicated data, marketing is continually evolving on a daily basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>‘Digital Marketers’ have adapted to this new landscape but how many actually understand the inner workings of these campaigns?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How many will be able to change a CTA or fix a broken link without referring to a dev team?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is why I believe learning web development is incredibly important for any marketer looking to make their mark in the industry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few examples why learning code will be helpful for any digital marketer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Don’t Waste Money</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to throw $50,000 to buy your social media presence, but how efficient is it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As a digital marketer, you can run various campaigns to maximize your ROI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From A/B testing in e-mail campaigns, to reviewing your website CTA’s, you can save yourself unnecessary dollars on inefficient campaigns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Quick Fixes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of the times, you need to consult your dev team for simple changes to your website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This takes time away from your dev team from working on higher level tasks and sometimes can take weeks to complete.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, marketers can do simple tasks such as changing photos to updating hyperlinks without having to bug your dev team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Communicate Effectively</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you do consult with your dev team, communicating clearly will push your project forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marketers with a basic understanding of how development works will know what may and may not work ahead of time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore they will be able to understand the project scope and assist in ideation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Understanding Your E-Commerce Site</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2010, <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/28/forrester-e-commerce/#uFxTxXWE9Sqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e-commerce sales increased 12.6% to $176.2 billion. By 2015, experts are predicting sales to reach $278.9 billion</a>. With basic coding knowledge, marketers can set-up simple e-commerce sites with the help of platforms such as <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Drive Traffic To Your Site</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Blog content is a tool to push your website’s SEO.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/2014-state-of-inbound" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HubSpot&#8217;s 2014 State of Inbound Report</a>, marketers who have prioritized blogging are 13x more likely to enjoy positive ROI.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span> With this in mind, digital marketers who consistently work on pushing out content will become successful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Reviewing Data</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Breaking down inbound marketing activity or closed sales analytics are all important for marketers to review their sales funnel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With a coding background, marketers will be able to craft dashboard charts tailored to help you review weekly analytics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ready to start coding?</a></span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/download.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2038" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/download.jpg" alt="How Apple Pay Will Impact Canada's Banking Industry" width="447" height="252" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/download.jpg 447w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/download-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px" /></a></p>
<p>Since Apple launched its mobile payment service, Apple Pay, <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/apple-introduces-pay-its-first-major-foray-into-digital-payments-2014-09-09">in the U.S. back in October</a>, most wondered when this technology would be adopted north of the border.</p>
<p>Recent rumblings suggest <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/apple-pay-readies-canadian-launch-2015-01-09" target="_blank">Apple Pay may launch in Canada</a>, potentially as early as this month.</p>
<p>There’s no question that the banking landscape in Canada is different than that of the States. Our culture tends to be on the conservative side with stricter regulations and more supervision. This hasn’t seemed to affect their bottom line; every quarter we watch as banks post soaring profits. But with an increased adoption of the internet among Canadians, technology companies are eyeing a slice of the pie by looking for ways to remove banks as the middlemen between tech-savvy consumers and their purchases.</p>
<p>As we anticipate Apple Pay’s entry into the market, let’s look at three ways this might have an impact on the Canadian banking sector.</p>
<p><strong>1.The appetite for mobile will continue to grow.</strong></p>
<p>It’s no surprise that Canadians, <a href="http://think.storage.googleapis.com/docs/canadian-millennials-banking-online_infographics.pdf" target="_blank">especially Millennials</a>, are open to more alternative forms of banking. A growing number of connected Canadians bank primarily online and, who really goes to a bank branch anymore? We want access to our hard-earned money instantly and on-the-go.</p>
<p>Yes, other banks in Canada have offered up their versions of a mobile wallet, but usage depends on a number of factors like purchase amount or your wireless service provider. Considering nearly half of Canadians say they keep their phone on hand over 90% of the day, Apple Pay has the ability to really kick this trend into high gear.</p>
<p><strong>2. Early bank gets the boost.</strong></p>
<p>From the moment Apple announced this mobile payment service, consumers starting asking their banks if and when it would be available to them. Unlike their U.S.-counterparts, Canadian banks won’t make a profit off of debit transactions. They have less of an incentive to offer their customers a platform that would live outside their own mobile app.</p>
<p>However, banks are also aware that technology and innovation are becoming an increasingly important differentiator in their space. That’s why they invest so heavily in testing things like wearables and biometric technology. Last year, Tangerine was the first bank to launch Voice Banking and Touch ID through their mobile app with plans to release Voice Authentication sometime in 2015.</p>
<p>Being first out of the gate with Apple Pay will ensure they become the first default card in a digital wallet. Besides, a recent Google survey showed that about half of Millennials would switch banks to gain a better mobile experience.</p>
<p><strong>3. Increased privacy, reduced fraud.</strong></p>
<p>Every year, Canadian banks and credit issuers fork out millions in covering fraudulent transactions. In 2013 alone, there was over half a billion dollars’ worth of credit and debit card fraud across the country.</p>
<p>Apple Pay has proven to be more secure than traditional methods of payment, and more private. Apple won’t collect your purchase information or history. Merchants will no longer have access to information like your name, address or card number. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of your device. To make a purchase, you’ll need your fingerprint.</p>
<p>And in the unfortunate case that you lose your phone? Well, you can even disable it remotely using the Find My iPhone app. That means less cards having to be replaced and a lot of money saved when it comes to fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The typical pillow fight between Canadian banks may be getting a lot more hostile, stay tuned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2014 was a whirlwind of a year. Since I wrote <a href="http://www.secure.techvibes.com/blog/open-letter-to-technology-educators-2014-02-25">An Open Letter to Technology Educators</a> approximately a year ago, a lot had changed for BrainStation and we&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way. Two things haven’t changed: software is still “eating the world” and our goal to empower 1 million people by 2020 is more alive than ever.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014, BrainStation was acquired by Konrad Group, a global leader in the consumer and enterprise technology space. In collaboration, BrainStation is revamping our curricula and programming, introducing new courses and workshops, and expanding across North America. So, we thought it would be valuable (and fun!) to get together and identify the top 5 digital skill sets we’re seeing out there:</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Front-End Web Development</em></strong><em>:</em></p>
<p><strong>What</strong>: For those that are unfamiliar with web development, it can be broken down into “front-end” and “back-end”. If we use the comparison of a car, the front-end would be everything you can see and touch; the leather seats, red paint and sleek bumper. The back-end would be the engineering “under the hood” that makes the car work that you can’t see; the engine, distributor and braking system. Now think of a website, the overall structure and aesthetics that you can see; the colours, buttons and fonts are the front-end, the data storage, processing and overall integration is the back-end.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: You don’t need to become a full-time developer to benefit from increasing your technical knowledge. A solid foundation of web development will allow you to <a href="http://www.secure.techvibes.com/blog/bridging-the-communication-gap-why-we-could-all-benefit-from-learning-code-2014-02-20">bridge the communication gap</a> that exists in all industries to operate more effectively.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. User Experience Design:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>What: </strong>UX design focuses on maximizing the user’s overall experience with a product, this can be digital or physical. We’ve all sat in a chair that is too stiff or too low, and I’m sure we’ve all found a chair that is extremely comfortable and supportive. In the digital space, I’m sure we’ve all clicked on buttons in the wrong spot, and I’m sure we’ve also had seamless checkouts using an ecommerce platform. These are the differences between bad and good user experiences and all are driven by a framework that would include everything from research to interviews to actually creating a blueprint of the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> Today’s digital users are busy and impatient. They demand a seamless online experience thats gets them what they want as fast as possible. Understanding the thought process behind an effective user experience can make a huge difference in keeping users engaged with your products. The happier they are with their experience, the better your chances of conversion are. It is said that a good user experience can be noticed instantaneously, but a great user experience goes unnoticed because it’s that smooth.</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Growth Hacking/Digital Marketing:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Growth hacking and digital marketing are extremely hot topics and continue to evolve as the internet changes and becomes embedded into our everyday lives in different ways. This can include everything from digital advertising (think of billboards and banners in the physical space) to email marketing (think to the days of print mail&#8230;whomp whomp!) to push notifications on your smart devices.</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> The methods by which a potential “customer” can be reached are changing at an alarming rate. Understanding the basics of social media is only the start, as there is a complete science involved in listening to, speaking to and converting visitors into users, paying customers, or whatever your key objective is (typically to buy what you’re selling!)</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Digital Product Management:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> If you think of a Product Manager in the “physical space” for something like a corporate building, they are the ones resourcing teams, setting deadlines, and overall managing the expectations and results of the build. A digital product can be classified as anything that is built without physical resources; there is no steel, no lumber or paint. Facebook and your local pubs’ website are both examples of digital product, obviously built out with completely different goals in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> While there are definitely similarities between “physical” and “digital” project management, it truly is another world. For digital product management you aren’t using any physical resources, just people and their time. Knowing how to motivate people, establish appropriate roadmaps and the tools/softwares needed to manage projects is essential to your success at delivering the appropriate digital solution.</p>
<p><strong><em>5. Mobile Development:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> Mobile development includes building out software or an overall experience that can be scaled across our handheld devices: smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> We have already become a mobile first society and there is no shortage of stats that solidify that the industry is only going to get bigger. For example, the average user is engaging about 200 times a day with their mobile device of choice, spending an average of two hours and 21 minutes a day on them.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2003" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download5.jpg" alt="Why Using Google Plus Will Be Your Cost-Free Secret Weapon" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download5.jpg 750w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>For those that utilize social media for business purposes on a regular basis, the thrill that you get from the likes, shares, retweets, and comments from the social media giants of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn is simply not replicated when it comes to Google Plus. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/technology/the-plus-in-google-plus-its-mostly-for-google.html">New York Times</a> puts it, Google Plus is a ‘ghost town’. But consider this, what are you really trying to accomplish when you share content over social media? To optimize your brand and gain customers, am I right?</p>
<p>Despite all of the buzz that you receive on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, the conversion rates of your marketing and branding efforts are actually quite low. In stark contrast, investing your time in Google Plus can prove shockingly positive results in helping you generate conversion rates and effective branding. Here is why:</p>
<p><strong>1. Search Engine Optimization</strong></p>
<p>No one loves Google more than Google, so by utilizing their most predominant social media outlet (Google+), your SEO value becomes far greater. For starters, just posting content through Google+ will generate higher SEO. If you want to take it further, try gaining traction through expanding your Google Circles. The bigger your Circles are, the more visibility you will gain. If your content is valuable and they +1 (like) it or share it, this will gain your business a higher ranking as well as raise your click rates through Google Adwords.</p>
<p><strong>2. Local Optimization</strong></p>
<p>97% of customers search for local businesses online. Just think about that time when you were scoping out the nearest flower store for a last minute date, or the nearest coffee store to get Wi-Fi. By using Google Plus, your profile will become more visible within your community, displaying crucial pieces of information such as store hours, address, phone number and such all in one place.</p>
<p><strong>3. Building stronger relationships</strong></p>
<p>Unlike Facebook, where there is an oversaturation of trivial information, Google+ is a place for much more in-depth conversations. It allows for detailed feedback, private conversations, and Google Hangouts also allows you to make intimate relationships with customers. You may notice that whenever you do a Google search of a business, the customer reviews of that business immediately pops up. The majority of these reviews are generated from dialogues on Google+. Positive reviews will do wonders for your company, and conversely if you have negative reviews, Google+ makes it easy to hide that content.</p>
<p>In addition to building your relationship with customers, Google+ also allows you to reach out to key influencers. If you have communications and dialogue with these influencers on the Google platform, it in turn boosts the reputation of your own business.</p>
<p><strong>4. Latest Google+ post appears in search results</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who have stayed loyal to Google+ and continue to post your content regularly through it, please continue to do so! By providing constant up-to-date content from your business, it will consistently keep your company sitting at the top position of a Google search. The logic behind this is perfectly sound, if you stop posting, your business might have closed or lost its relevance to the customers. Keep on posting to inform the world that your company is important, thriving, and relevant to their needs.</p>
<p><strong>5. YouTube and Google+ Integration</strong></p>
<p>Many businesses have created phenomenal company videos that are going unviewed. Make sure to link your Google+ page with your YouTube page. This way, every time your business is searched on Google, not only will the company page pop up, but also the company YouTube page. This way, your brilliant marketing videos will finally be seen.</p>
<p>As you can see, Google+ is not a platform to be overlooked. Even just by putting small amounts of effort into maintaining the account, strong results will come. It legitimizes your company, it increases targeting towards relevant customers, and it allows you build quality dialogues and relationships with those that matter. After all, there are more than 235 million active Google+ accounts and it is a platform created by the most powerful and influential search engine in the world. So if you still think Google+ is a ‘ghost town’, think again.</p>
<p>If you do want to become an expert on Google Plus, here’s is a fantastic <a href="http://marketingland.com/beyond-social-benefits-google-business-73460">article</a> that will teach you everything you could possibly learn about it!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1969" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download3.jpg" alt="Five Rules for Startups" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download3.jpg 750w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>Starting a company is often the most important decision you’ll ever make in your life. You’re going against all odds and entering a phase where you’ll work harder than you ever have before. Money will initially be slow and social life will be non-existent. You put everything into the startup and the chances of failing are quite high. Below are some quick tips that may help reduce the chances of failing early on.</p>
<p><strong>1) Don’t start a company unless it’s an obsession. </strong></p>
<p>A startup will devour your life. You’ll live and breathe it. The last thing you want is being stuck with a company you’re not passionate about. You have to be in love with it. You have to be in it for the long-term and for the right motives. If your goal is to make “quick” money and exit, then it’s not an obsession.</p>
<p><strong>2) Sales cure all</strong></p>
<p>Sales are the cheapest form of financing. Startups spend far too much time worrying about other functions in the business. Initially, sales should be your number one priority. Know how your company will make money and how you will actually make sales. Don’t assume customers will automatically come to you simply because you have the fanciest product in the market. That thinking will take you to the startup graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>3) Know your strengths, hire your weaknesses. </strong></p>
<p>Know your startup’s core competencies and build your team accordingly. What are some of the most important functions of your business that will make or break it? If you’re lacking strength in any one of them, hire a rockstar and most importantly, pay him or her a rockstar salary or equity. Don’t treat them like an employee and pay them cheaply.</p>
<p><strong>4) Keep it flat</strong></p>
<p>Don’t create marketing or finance departments in your startups, that’s for big corporations to do. Keep your organization flat and open. Keep everyone in tune with what’s going on and keep up the energy. There is nothing private in a startup. If you have managers reporting to managers in a startup, you’ll increase your chances of hitting the graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>5) Don’t spread yourself thin.</strong></p>
<p>It’s natural to get carried away when you start seeing results. After your first sale, your goal should be get the second, third and the thousandth sale, not to start thinking about expansion. Initially, it’s extremely important to be tunnel visioned and focus on one revenue stream. Establish a strong sales cycle and prove your business model before thinking about other revenue streams or geographical expansion.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-11.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1965" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-11.png" alt="Learning is the New Skill" width="750" height="457" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-11.png 750w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-11-300x183.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>There is a skill that is far more important than coding, or any other skill for that matter, and that is the ability to learn.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk recently about learning to code. As a founder of BrainStation, a company educating people in technology and programming, I’m surrounded by it. So, should you learn to code? Without a doubt, yes! I’m biased of course, but for good reason. I recently stumbled across this great video PBS put together, “Is Code the Most Important Language in the World?” I think it explains the importance and benefits of coding better than I can.</p>
<p>That being said, there is a skill that is far more important than coding, or any other skill for that matter, and that is the ability to learn.</p>
<p>“Learning is the new skill. Imagination, creation and asking new questions are at its core.” – Sugata Mitra</p>
<p>In a world that is increasingly becoming automated and dominated by technology, the skill that will really set you apart is the ability to adapt and learn. Auto manufacturing is a compelling example of how automation can transform an industry, transferring jobs and skills traditionally performed by humans to machines.</p>
<p>The transformation of industries through the adoption of technology is a trend that will only become more relevant going forward. And this is the primary reason why the ability to learn is so important: learning new skills and adapting to your environment is the only way to ensure you don’t become obsolete.</p>
<p>During my time in education, I have seen one definitive trend: the most successful students are the ones who take ownership of their education, who are resourceful, who proactively seek answers to their questions, who are independent, and self-directed in their learning. It’s also interesting to note that these people often require the least instruction or direction. Not because they’re brighter or more capable, but because the process of exploration, seeking answers, making mistakes, breaking things, creating mental models and forming ideas about the world actually improves their understanding and retention of concepts. The success these people achieve by applying this “blueprint” to their learning extends well beyond the classroom into their jobs, hobbies and the general acquisition of knowledge in their daily lives.</p>
<p>“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.&#8221; – Chinese Proverb</p>
<p>Our entire philosophy at BrainStation has been shaped and molded around how we can create the best “learners.&#8221; When building curriculum or structuring the learning environment, we are always looking for ways to facilitate and support the development of learning as a skill, not just programming and technology. I believe great education should be about more than just learning math, science, or in this case coding. A great education should empower you with the confidence and skills to blaze your own trail in life.</p>
<p>Below are the qualities we strive to instill in all of our students at BrainStation. Developing these qualities will make you more successful in everything that you do.</p>
<p>Here are five traits of a world-class learner.</p>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1436202053523_684"><strong>1. Comfortable with Failure:</strong> Failing is inherent in the learning process. Your first painting, web application or poem is going to suck, but it will get better. Think about all the shots Michael Jordan missed or the number of times Babe Ruth struck out. Learn, adapt, improve, move forward.</p>
<p><strong>2. Relentlessly Resourceful:</strong> Answers are not always obvious or immediately available. Go find the answers to your questions, don’t rely on others to find them for you. And remember, there are no rules in life, don’t be afraid to try new things and think outside of the box. Technology has provided us with some incredible tools to gather information. I use Google. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>3. Self-directed.</strong> Ultimately, you are responsible for your education. It’s time we stop putting the responsibility of education solely on instructors, teachers or administrators. They are there to facilitate learning, not define it. The more you rely on the institutions and systems to direct your learning, the less adaptive you will become.</p>
<p><strong>4. Confident:</strong> Approach new challenges with positivity, knowing that you can overcome anything. Will it be difficult? Probably. But your frame of mind will have a significant impact on how you deal with the ambiguity and discomfort of learning something new. If you’re confident, the result is a foregone conclusion. All that’s left is to execute.</p>
<p><strong>5. Master Skills:</strong> The real world is not made up of multiple-choice exams or grading systems where 60% is a pass. Learning is not a race and there is little value in having a skillset that is 60% complete. Master concepts and skills before moving forward. A strong house is built on a solid foundation, not one full of holes and cracks.</p>
<p>What I love most about the list of traits above is that these are things we can all acquire. We’re all capable of great things. Be confident, fearless and dream big. Whatever your passions or interests are in life, develop the ability to learn and you’ll set yourself free.</p>
<p>In the words of Mugatu from Zoolander: “Learning&#8230; so hot right now.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1949" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-1.png" alt="The Top 7 Reasons to Learn at BrainStation" width="750" height="502" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-1.png 750w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-1-300x201.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a></p>
<p>Founded in 2012 by a community of thinkers and builders, BrainStation is a progressive educational institution that is powering the next generation of creators. Fuelled by Konrad Group, a global leader in the consumer and enterprise technology space, BrainStation’s curriculum is developed and iterated in real-time based on what&#8217;s trending in the industry. Our rainStation’s class structure combines in-person instruction with online content and an adaptive curriculum. Small class sizes are led by industry professionals and an active, hands-on education engages students to ask questions, challenge themselves, and build valuable new skills.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Hands-on and Project Based Learning</strong></p>
<p>We believe in learning by doing. You don’t learn to ride a bike by reading books, you learn by getting on the bike and riding. We take the same approach to education. Lectures, readings, tutorials and exercises are a great primer, but in the end there is nothing like creating real projects. By the end of all of our courses, students walk away with a portfolio of projects and the knowledge, confidence and freedom to continue to create on their own.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Learn From Industry Professionals</strong></p>
<p>Nothing beats learning directly from an expert. All of our educators are industry professionals and have an intimate knowledge of the newest tools, techniques and technologies. They bring real world experience into the classroom. Our curriculum is constantly being adapted based on what’s trending in the industry, ensuring the skills our students leave with are truly cutting edge.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Community &amp; Support System</strong></p>
<p>Your success is our success. We want you to leave our courses ready to conquer the world. We are available around the clock to answer questions and help you with your work.</p>
<p>Community is incredibly important to us. BrainStation was created to be a connector for the technology and startup ecosystems. We help you with employment opportunities, establish relationships with mentors, connect you with incubators and accelerators, and provide any additional resources you may need to be successful once you’ve left our classrooms. We are here to support you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>4.) Learn To Learn</strong></p>
<p>Beyond teaching you how to create and build technology, we focus heavily on teaching you how to learn. Our goal is to empower you with the habits, techniques and the mindset to become an independent and self-directed learner. Once you leave our classroom, you will have the skills and confidence to take ownership of your education and tackle any challenges that come your way.</p>
<p><strong>5.)  Flipped classroom</strong></p>
<p>We have taken the traditional education model and flipped it on its head. Students spend time outside of the classroom working through a curated list of readings, videos, tutorials and exploring new concepts. Class time is reserved for tackling more difficult questions, the application of newly learned concepts and working on projects under the guidance of our educators.</p>
<p><strong>6.) Flex Model &amp; Small Class Sizes</strong></p>
<p>Everyone learns at different speeds and requires different types of support to be successful. Unlike traditional education models that are heavily structured and move at one speed, our education model is designed to be flexible based on the needs of the individual student. We are able to cater our projects to what your individual goals are. An entrepreneur may want to create a website for their business while a “foodie” may want to create their own blog. Our small class sizes ensure that each student gets the attention they need and that no one gets left behind.</p>
<p><strong>7.) Your Classmates</strong></p>
<p>You will be surrounded by other driven and creative minds from all walks of life. Men and women, young and old, beginners and experienced, entrepreneurs, young professionals and full-time students. Regardless of background, everyone at BrainStation is here to learn new skills and connect with new people. Group work and collaboration are core pieces to all of our courses, so there are plenty of opportunities to get to know your classmates and grow your network.</p>
