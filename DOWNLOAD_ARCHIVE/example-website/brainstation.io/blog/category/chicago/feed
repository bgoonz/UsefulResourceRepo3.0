								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Word is spreading about the <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-chicago-is-poised-to-become-a-global-tech-leader">thriving tech ecosystem in Chicago</a>, so we thought that with 2020 set to get underway, it was a good time to look back on another busy year in the Windy City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the top tech industry stories and development from the year that was in Chicago.</span></p>
<h2><b>VC Funding Stays High</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through three quarters of 2019 and amid a national decline, venture funding in Chicago was down slightly from the record-setting first nine months of 2017 and 2018 – $1.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion in each of the previous two years – but there was still plenty of reason to celebrate. After all, the number was still dramatically higher than the $900 million raised in 2015 and 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year got off to a good start as enterprise software company Vistex raised $65 million – and up to an additional $40 million – for future strategic acquisitions, while auto insurance startup Clearcover raised $43 million with an eye on expanding to more states, and FourKites announced a $50 million Series C round to bring its total capital raised to $100.5 million. Grassroots Cannabis then turned heads by raising $90 million in March, one of the biggest funding rounds for an American cannabis company.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10317" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eric-Lefkofsky-Groupon-Co-Founder.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10317" class="size-full wp-image-10317" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eric-Lefkofsky-Groupon-Co-Founder.jpeg" alt="Eric Lefkofsky, Groupon Co-Founder" width="225" height="225" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eric-Lefkofsky-Groupon-Co-Founder.jpeg 225w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eric-Lefkofsky-Groupon-Co-Founder-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eric-Lefkofsky-Groupon-Co-Founder-109x109.jpeg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Eric-Lefkofsky-Groupon-Co-Founder-100x100.jpeg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10317" class="wp-caption-text">Eric Lefkofsky, Groupon Co-Founder</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month later, Tempus announced the biggest funding round of the year in Chicago: $200 million Series F at a value of $3.1 billion dollars. The data-driven precision medicine company, led by Groupon co-founder Eric Lefkofsky, has grown tremendously in a short period of time; since being founded in 2015, the Tempus platform now affects more than one in four U.S. cancer patients. In announcing the funding, Lefkofsky </span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-tempus-raises-funding-and-valuation-20190529-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company would hire between five and 10 people per week with the intention of adding hundreds of employees to its Chicago headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From our founding, Tempus has been singularly focused on improving the lives of patients diagnosed with disease, starting with cancer,” </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/30/1859205/0/en/Tempus-Announces-200-Million-in-Series-F-Financing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lefkofsky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three and a half years later, we are empowering stakeholders across healthcare with insights derived from real-world clinical evidence connected to rich molecular data. We are humbled by the industry response thus far and remain committed to delivering on the promise of precision medicine to improve patient care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the biotech sphere, VillageMD – a developer of primary care clinics – raised $100 million in Series B in September, pledging to use the money to expand its primary care footprint and enhance docOS, its primary care platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Chicago startups receiving major investments included: AMP Americas, which received $75 million after developing a solution to turn cow poop into renewable natural gas for trucking fleets; LanzaTech, a next-generation fuels producer that raised $72 million in August; and Cameo – the startup that allows fans to buy personalized video greetings from their celebrities, athletes and performers – which closed $50 million in Series B financing in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the local acquisitions front, homegrown cannabis startup Verano Holdings was acquired by Phoenix-based Harvest Health &amp; Recreation in a landmark March deal for $850 million. That will allow Harvest to hold licenses allowing it to operate up to 200 facilities in 16 states across the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>A Supportive Atmosphere</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s ascent to tech-hub status couldn’t have happened without the robust support of varying levels of government, community partners and local businesses, and that certainly continued in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and several local tech leaders gathered to mark the third annual Chicago Tech Day. Hosted by eDiscovery software solutions company Relativity, the event saw attendees celebrate the 2,000 new jobs added by 15 local tech companies around the end of 2019. In 2020, Relativity will launch Relativity Fellows, a program that will find, train and employ people from Chicago’s underserved communities, with a focus on the South and West sides of the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For tech leaders, it’s important that we reach into the communities where opportunities don’t come,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2019/11/18/chicago-tech-day-2019-relativity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO Mike Gamson, noting that Relativity would be on track to expand from 1,000 local employees to 1,400 by the end of 2020. “We need to take responsibility for recognizing that talent is often distributed evenly, but opportunity is not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago also got good news in October from the Illinois government when a $45 billion capital bill with tax incentives for data centers – intended to lure more IT industry to the state – was signed into law. And in August, the government launched Connect Illinois, a $420 million statewide broadband expansion project that will improve the state’s infrastructure and spur future economic and educational growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year also saw also further recognition for <a href="https://www.borndigital.com/2016/08/23/killer-spaces-1871-is-the-future-of-chicago-innovation">Chicago’s groundbreaking tech hub 1871</a>. At the World Incubation Summit in 2019 in Qatar, 1871 – which is home to 450 member companies, 650-plus active alumni companies, seven university partners, and 100 corporate and community partner organizations – was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the world’s No. 1 private business incubator.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10318" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10318" class="size-large wp-image-10318" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chicago’s groundbreaking tech hub 1871" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871-768x512.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871-960x640.jpg 960w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/1871.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10318" class="wp-caption-text">Chicago’s groundbreaking tech hub 1871</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The wonderful and well-deserved recognition is a testament to the energy and dynamism of our tech community and the result of countless individuals working together to make Chicago the global leader in entrepreneurship and innovation that it is today,”&nbsp;said Mayor Lightfoot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we move forward into the future, we will be building on our success by strengthening our capacity downtown and expanding our reach further into Chicago’s educational institutions, neighborhoods, and communities, ensuring that every entrepreneur can take their great idea and have it drive our economy, transform our lives, and change the way we see the world.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Silicon Valley Giants Finding a Home in the Second City</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Windy City was the site of many a major real estate deal in 2019, as locally grown companies and especially Silicon Valley tech giants expanded the scope of their Chicago operations or established entirely new offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber signed a 10-year lease at the Old Post Office in downtown Chicago in August, giving the ride-sharing company 463,000 more square feet of office space. It was the fourth-largest office deal in Chicago in the past five years according to CBRE, and it represents a further investment in the area for Uber, which counts its Chicago office as the second-largest outside of its San Francisco headquarters. Uber </span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-uber-freight-expanding-chicago-20190304-story.html#nt=instory-link"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March that it planned to hire hundreds in Chicago for its Uber Freight unit, which connects truck drivers with shippers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uber is excited to deepen its roots in Chicago,” company Spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said. “The city continues to attract the top talent that Uber needs to continue to thrive, and we remain committed to working together to have a positive impact in the local community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, work continued on Salesforce Tower Chicago – a brand-new, 57-story tower that the San Francisco-based cloud software company vowed would be home to 1,000 new jobs by the time it opens in 2023 – and Facebook moved closer to the projected 2020 opening of its massive new office in the Loop, which is expected to bring with it the hiring of at least 2,000 new employees.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10320" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SALESFORCE.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10320" class="size-full wp-image-10320" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SALESFORCE.jpg" alt="Salesforce Tower Chicago " width="1000" height="713" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SALESFORCE.jpg 1000w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SALESFORCE-300x214.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SALESFORCE-768x548.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SALESFORCE-960x684.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10320" class="wp-caption-text">Salesforce Tower Chicago</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be outdone, of course, was Google. Just as the company was cutting the ribbon on its new office at 210 N. Carpenter Street, reports surfaced indicating that the Silicon Valley giant planned to occupy all the space in two new buildings planned by Chicago developer Sterling Bay. That would be 800,000 square feet combined, bringing Google’s overall footprint in Chicago to about 1.3 million square feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Google’s rapid growth in Chicago mirrors the overall story of tech in the Midwest’s largest city.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_10319" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10319" class="size-medium wp-image-10319" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker-300x300.jpg" alt="Gov. J.B. Pritzker" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Gov.-J.B.-Pritzker.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10319" class="wp-caption-text">Gov. J.B. Pritzker</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2000, Google’s presence in Chicago was limited to a two-person sales office. Now, Google reports a Chicago-based workforce of 1,200 people and plans to hire thousands more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think of Google as a Chicago-based company,” </span><a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2019/11/7/20953639/google-fulton-market-office-chicago"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker at the ribbon-cutting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The city’s culture, diversity, and strong emphasis on community made it a perfect fit for Google and we look forward to our continued growth for years to come,”&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-09-20/why-tech-companies-are-choosing-chicago"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Karen Sauder, Vice-President of Sales and Site Lead for Google Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the reason for the flurry of activity is that, compared to other major U.S. tech hubs, Chicago is still quite affordable. CBRE’s study found that a sample tech-firm might pay roughly $40.2 million annually to operate in Chicago, far less than in the Bay Area ($59.7 million), New York ($55.3 million) or Washington ($51.7 million) and much more in line with smaller cities including Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., Portland, Ore., or Miami.</span></p>
<h2><b>Startups with Potential</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With millions flying around in VC funding as we discussed, it’s not surprising that Chicago continues to be fertile ground for thriving startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global accounting and consultancy firm’s 25</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annual Deloitte Technology Fast 500 ranking singled out 12 Chicago companies for their rapid growth:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecommerce fulfillment service ShipBob, which grew at a rate of 2,550 percent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fitness Cubed, best known for its under-desk elliptical tool, Cubii&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal loan underwriter OppLoans</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G2, a platform that has helped businesses including Ford, Adobe, Nike, and Facebook make better buying decisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ActiveCampaign, which automates details of marketing campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-in-one hiring and talent management platform Hireology</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braviant Holdings, a provider of tech-enabled credit products and services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech news source Built In</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claims management platform Snapsheet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk management software companies Origami Risk and Fusion Risk Management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And fundamental research platform YCharts</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, another of Chicago’s top startups – social media management software company Sprout Social – filed plans in October to go public and raise $100 million.</span></p>
<h2><b>Poised to Grow</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you take the long view, it’s truly astounding how quickly Chicago has transitioned from being a city that few associated with tech to a bona fide worldwide tech hub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that tech jobs in Chicago have grown 38.6 percent since 2010, employing more than 143,000 people. Unsurprisingly, tech is the city’s fastest-growing industry sector, with more than 4,000 digital companies representing a 270 percent growth rate in just a decade. The city has also led the U.S. for five consecutive years in major corporate headquarters relocations. And it’s also worth pointing out that Chicago </span><a href="https://startupgenome.com/blog/chicago-top-ecosystem-for-female-founders"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the highest concentration of female-led startups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Chicago’s business community and local leadership are united in ensuring that the Windy City’s tech scene maintains its impressive momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every year, more tech companies are opening offices in Chicago, creating new jobs for our city’s unmatched workforce and furthering our status as a leading hub for 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-century innovation,” Mayor Lightfoot </span><a href="https://www.globest.com/2019/11/19/mayor-touts-burgeoning-tech-sector-that-is-adding-2000-jobs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a city, we are working to ensure residents in every community have the tools, resources, and skills they need to be a part of Chicago’s rapidly growing tech industry.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve written about the </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/6-great-chicago-startups-you-should-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Chicago, and why the city is poised to become a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-chicago-is-poised-to-become-a-global-tech-leader"><span style="font-weight: 400;">global tech leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but how can aspiring professionals break into this space?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help, we’ve put together the following guide to one of the fastest-growing tech hubs in the entire world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago City Tech Market</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s tech sector is growing rapidly and the world is starting to pay attention. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a recent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">KPMG report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expects Chicago to be among the top ten global tech innovation hubs over the next four years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hasn’t gone unnoticed at home either, as both the state and local governments have supported the city’s tech growth. In 2012, the city launched </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChicagoNEXT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which promotes Chicago’s tech scene globally.&nbsp; In 2016, the state founded the Illinois Department of Innovation and Technology with the goal of updating technological infrastructure and improving efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tech-friendly environment has encouraged the growth of a dynamic startup ecosystem, which saw almost&nbsp; $1.4 billion in funding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s thriving tech ecosystem enjoyed a </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/2018-was-another-big-year-for-chicago-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banner 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it has quickly climbed near the top of the list of the world’s most promising tech hubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crain’s Chicago Business reported that 2018 was the best year for Chicago’s venture-backed startup acquisitions in recent memory, and PitchBook’s 2018 Chicago VC Ecosystem report found that the city is outpacing other U.S. venture ecosystems, including the Bay Area and New York, in median multiple on invested capital. And recent studies from KPMG and the Startup Genome Project hailed Chicago as one of the top 10 global cities set to become hubs of technological information in the next few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a deeper look at six of the great startups leading the way for Chicago.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.cameo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Cameo</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wished you could send a short video message from a celebrity as a gift to a friend – say, from NBA legend </span><a href="https://www.cameo.com/kareem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, actor-rapper </span><a href="https://www.cameo.com/icet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ice T</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or actress </span><a href="https://www.cameo.com/jenlove" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Love Hewitt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Enter Cameo, a startup that has grown rapidly since its recent launch in March 2017 and attracted significant media attention – including meriting a spot on Time Magazine’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 Most Genius Companies of 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> list.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9318" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-09-at-4.58.10-PM.png" alt="Cameo" width="719" height="517" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-09-at-4.58.10-PM.png 719w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-09-at-4.58.10-PM-300x216.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just 26 months after launch, Cameo boasts a talent roster of 15,000 athletes, actors, performers and social-media influencers who have fulfilled a total of 275,000 personalized video shoutouts. Talent set their own prices from $5 to $2,500 and keep 75 percent of their revenue. According to Cameo, rapper Snoop Dogg and Bethenny Frankel were so enthusiastic about their experience with the company, they became investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They aren’t the only ones bullish on Cameo. In June, the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a $50 million Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins just months after closing a $12.5 Series A round in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Steven Galanis said then that the goal was international expansion, but they’re expanding locally too. At the start of 2019, their Chicago office was home to just 22 employees – months later, the headcount has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">risen above 100</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with 50 more hires expected this year.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://project44.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>project44</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billed as the world’s leading advanced visibility platform for shippers and third-party logistics firms, the freight tech startup project44 connects, automates, and illuminates key transportation processes. By digitizing the shipment lifecycle, project44 promises its users – and their network now spans 25,000 unique carriers – a smarter end-to-end shipping experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 by serial entrepreneur Jett McCandless, project44 now has 130 local employees in Chicago – with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hire 200 more over the next year – whose perks and benefits include paid volunteer time, happy hours, fitness subsidies, an onsite gym, and a game room. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9317" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/project44-office.jpg" alt="project44 office" width="810" height="540" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/project44-office.jpg 810w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/project44-office-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/project44-office-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, their spiffy new 42,000-square-foot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> features one of the city’s largest private rooftop decks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $45 million round of Series C funding in October 2018 brought its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">total funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to $90.5 million, and in December project44 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the acquisition of GateHouse Logistics, instantly creating the largest visibility platform across North America and Europe.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.tempus.com/"><b>Tempus</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015 by Groupon Co-Founder Eric Lefkofsky, the oncology-focused health tech unicorn Tempus has seen its profile absolutely soar in just a few years. The precision medicine company has built the world’s largest library of clinical and molecular data alongside an operating system to make that information accessible for doctors, patients, and researchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the company boasts that the platform now touches more than one in four cancer patients in the U.S. Tempus also has partnerships with leading oncology hubs like the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Mayo Clinic. Still, it really is hard to believe just how fast Tempus has grown – in May, the startup scored $200 million in Series F financing to bring its total funding to $520 million and carry its staggering valuation over the $3 billion mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to perks including unlimited vacation, commuter benefits, and an in-house barista, employees say they love the fact that they get to make a positive contribution to the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The professional growth opportunities here are infinite, but the greatest opportunity has been hearing stories from patients who are still alive today because of their Tempus results,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2018/12/07/spotlight-working-at-tempus-design-ux-engineering"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alissa Ampezzan, Director of Design. “Each one of those gives me goosebumps – that will never get old.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/"><b>Sprout Social</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An all-in-one social-media management and analytics platform, Sprout Social has indeed blossomed into one of Chicago’s top startups, especially for those looking for a company with a commitment to work-life balance and a generous slate of benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include free daily breakfast and lunch, comprehensive health, vision, dental and life insurance, and a 401(K) matching program. It doesn’t end there; the 415 employees based in the company’s office in the Loop – which features an onsite gym – also enjoy progressive parental leave, unlimited vacation, paid volunteer time, transportation benefits, free Divvy memberships, and wellness initiatives centered on health and financial well-being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s own financial well-being also seems secure – Sprout Social raised $40.5 million in Series D funding in December, bringing its total capital raised up to $103.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of everything else, the startup has a documented equal pay policy and a commitment to diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the most exciting parts about joining Team Sprout is that people of all backgrounds can thrive and grow here,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2018/09/04/top-companies-hiring-september"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chief People Officer Maureen Calabrese. </span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.grubhub.com/"><b>Grubhub</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of this food-delivery app would have any entrepreneur drooling. Celebrating its 15</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anniversary this year, Grubhub quickly became the top food delivery app in the country after launching in 2004 and is still thriving despite competition from Silicon Valley-based rivals Uber Eats and DoorDash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After going public in 2014, the company booked net income of $78.5 million on revenue of $1 billion in 2018. The startup now serves 19.3 million active diners and processes 521,000 daily orders from more than 115,000 takeout restaurants over 2,200 U.S. cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 1,200 employees based in Chicago and 3,000 overall, Grubhub offers benefits including quality insurance, 401(K) matching, a remote work program, unlimited time off, commuter benefits, free food, beer on tap, fitness subsidies, and retirement options, plus a culture that employees say encourages professional and personal development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a strong focus on constant improvement and learning,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2019/05/29/chicago-tech-companies-unique-cultures-part-one"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Software Engineer Pranay Nanda. “This collaborative culture at Grubhub has helped me home my craft and grow my engineering skill set immensely.”</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.fourkites.com/"><b>FourKites</b></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another leader among Chicago’s logistics platform startups, FourKites’ software allows the world’s largest shippers to access real-time and predictive visibility, improve on-time delivery, tighten inventory management, and deliver better customer service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 1,000 companies now relying on FourKites for real-time visibility, the startup has grown from a mere six employees when it launched in 2014 to 200-plus, with 190 of those based in its Chicago office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $50 million in new funding after a Series C round (led by existing investors August Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, CEAS Investments, and Hyde Park Angels), FourKites’ total capital has now grown to $100.5 million. Even as the company grows, employees rave about its close-knit culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had a 30-minute conversation with our CEO today. He was specifically asking me where we were with an account and what my thoughts are,” </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2017/03/21/fourkites-sales-team"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Patrick Cox, a Sales Development Representative with the company. “Everybody’s friends here. We have a happy hour once every month, and I can name everybody here.”</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once overshadowed by Silicon Valley and New York, Chicago is finally being recognized for its fast-growing tech scene. Recent studies by KPMG and the Startup Genome Project have positioned Chicago among the top 10 global cities likely to become leading hubs of technological information over the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chicago has the talent, education and training programs, technology infrastructure, capital, incentives, and an innovative culture,” </span><a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2017/march/Statement_KPMG_Tech_Report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> KPMG Chicago’s tech industry leader Mike Gervasio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The area is well-positioned to be a leading tech hub for years to come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s why Chicago is poised to become a global tech leader. </span></p>
<h2><b>A Diversity of Companies</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems all varieties of companies are looking to do business in Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">top hirers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of tech talent locally include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorola</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echo Global Logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groupon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was launched in Chicago in 2008. There have been major startup success stories in fintech (like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braintree</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acquired by PayPal), data science (Cleversafe, which was sold for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.3 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to IBM), and healthcare (IBM also acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merge Healthcare</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those top tech companies have been a sturdy anchor for local tech talent. The number of people employed by Chicago’s biggest tech companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rose 15 percent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 2016 to 2017, after rising 17 percent a year prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps that the Midwest can boast a high concentration of major companies, including Kraft Heinz, General Mills, and Procter &amp; Gamble. Better yet, those organizations have a proven dedication to bolstering the local startup scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider Kraft, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an incubator program for food and beverage startups called </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Springboard</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dedicated to supporting brands making healthy, organic, and experiential products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kellogg’s was behind the venture capital fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eighteen94 Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which promises to invest $100 million in fledgling companies – and General Mills’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">301 Inc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is dedicated to health and wellness startups. Kellogg’s has boosted the local scene in other ways too; in 2017 the company acquired Chicago-based </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RXBAR</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a stunning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$600 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies from outside Chicago have also sought a bigger footprint in the city. Salesforce, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Microsoft have all recently expanded operations in Chicago, while Google has gone from one small office opened near the turn of the millennium to a total Chicago workforce of more than 1,000 workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The city’s culture, diversity, and strong emphasis on community made it a perfect fit for Google and we look forward to our continued growth for years to come,” </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-09-20/why-tech-companies-are-choosing-chicago"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Karen Sauder, Vice-President of Sales and Site Lead for Google Chicago.</span></p>

<h2><b>Supportive Government and Institutional Partners</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago’s growth has been fuelled by the government at several levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Rahm Emanuel launched a citywide technology strategy in 2013 after creating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChicagoNEXT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which promotes Chicago’s tech scene globally, a year prior. In 2016, the state founded the Illinois Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) with the mission of updating the state’s own technological infrastructure and creating a more efficient system overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edward L. Kaplan New Venture Challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – offered through the University of Chicago – has graduated more than 230 startup companies that have achieved more than $13 billion in mergers and exits, including Grubhub, Braintree and Simple Mills.</span></p>
<h2><b>VC Funding is on the Rise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With almost $1.4 billion in funding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many Chicago companies had a lot to celebrate last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the way was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">empus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cancer data library platform for doctors, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $80 million in March</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before gathering another </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$110 million Series E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, bringing the company’s valuation above $2 billion.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_8166" style="width: 820px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8166" class="size-full wp-image-8166" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tempus-Labs.jpg" alt="Tempus Labs, Chicago" width="810" height="554" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tempus-Labs.jpg 810w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tempus-Labs-300x205.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tempus-Labs-768x525.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8166" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Built in Chicago</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also notable was the logistics management platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">project44</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which raised </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2018/04/17/project44-35-million-funding-round" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$80 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across two rounds of funding in April and October. It’s little wonder the company managed to open a sprawling new </span><a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/2018/06/14/project44-merchandise-mart-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42,000-square-foot office space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Merchandise Mart. Once belonging to Google, the space has room for up to 250 employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The healthcare solution startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VillageMD</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also raised </span><a href="https://www.villagemd.com/press-releases/villagemd-announces-80-million-growth-financing-from-athyrium-capital-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$80 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January, enabling the company to double the number of primary care providers it supports, and expand into markets including Michigan and Georgia.</span></p>
<h2><b>Major Exits Turning Heads</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago tech companies were in hot demand in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the biggest acquisition of the year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DocuSign</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a digital transaction management firm – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plans to acquire Chicago’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpringCM</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a cloud-based document generation and contract lifecycle management software company, in a $220 million cash deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Chef</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – one of the top online sellers of grocery meal kits – was scooped up by Kroger for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$200 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an entirely made-in-Chicago deal, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cars.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bought two fellow local companies – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealer Inspire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launch Digital Marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both of which provide digital tools for car dealers – for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$165 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in other major 2018 deals: Chicago startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CityBase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps local governments digitize payment and administrative processes, was acquired for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$160 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GTY Technology Holdings Inc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; benefits enterprise company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maestro Health</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was scooped up by French insurance provider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AXA Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$155 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and cloud hosting company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SingleHop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was acquired by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">INAP</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$132 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>An Appetite for Innovation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principal reason there’s so much optimism around Chicago’s future lies in its growing reputation for innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KPMG recently polled more than 750 global technology industry leaders and determined that Chicago was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">considered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the third-most innovative tech hub in the U.S. alongside Boston, after only Silicon Valley and New York. Globally, Chicago </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Top 10. Likewise, the Innovation Cities Program, ranked Chicago </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among North American cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the CompTIA Cyberstates Innovation 2018 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranked Illinois with the sixth-highest innovation score and the fifth-highest net tech employment rank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who have seen the growth up-close see no reason to believe Chicago’s momentum is on the verge of slowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Entrepreneurs stay here and keep reinvesting,” </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2018-09-20/why-tech-companies-are-choosing-chicago" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alya Adamany Woods, Executive Director of ChicagoNEXT. “They’re not leaving Chicago. They stay here and start more companies, and that keeps the interest here as well.”</span></p>
