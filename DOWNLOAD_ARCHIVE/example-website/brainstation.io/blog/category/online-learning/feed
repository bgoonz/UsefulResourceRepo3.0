								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>*by</em> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrious, the largest premium workplace provider in the country.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many people staying at home, online learning has become the norm — at a time when rates were already high. In 2017, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">77 percent of American companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented some form of online learning, with 98 percent planning to do so this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re taking advantage of the time at home to develop professionally or personally, online learning has a number of benefits. It’s more convenient and less time-intensive than in-person courses. And it can have significant results: </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/are-online-courses-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a recent survey of 1,000 online students, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">91 percent said it improved their professional lives and 93 percent, their resume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to get the most out of your studies, you need a setup that will help you focus. As a flexible workplace provider, part of our mission at </span><a href="https://www.industriousoffice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industrious</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to design spaces that actively </span><a href="https://www.industriousoffice.com/blog/thrive-at-work/four-ways-to-hack-your-productivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encourage productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the office, that means anything from having different rooms optimized for different kinds of work modes to creating a beautiful environment that members are excited to spend time in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how to translate some of the lessons we use every day in our offices to your home study space.</span></p>
<h3><b>Identify the Right Study Spot</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the urge to plop yourself down on the couch with your laptop when you need to focus. Your work — and your work-life balance — will improve if you take the time to designate a specific area for your studies. Otherwise, it’s all too easy to get distracted when you’re trying to concentrate. The opposite is also true; it can be harder to switch out of study mode when you’re working in the exact same spot you watch TV in. Especially if you’re a troubled sleeper, you should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid working in your bedroom</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">even leaving your study materials there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want a calm place where you study in peace. But what if the bedroom or living room is your only option? You can create visual distance between your studies and your home life by positioning your desk or table so that it’s removed from the sightline of your couch or bed and vice versa. For example, face a window overlooking a quiet street. Or, put up a barrier like a curtain, screen, or even a bookshelf.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pay Attention to Your Comfort</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first sit down, you might not even notice that your setup is uncomfortable. But if you give it time, you could start experiencing lower back or neck pain. Don’t let it get to that point — make adjustments with items you already have and by making small investments in equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top of your monitor should be at about eye level. To achieve this, you could purchase in a laptop stand, or use books to raise your screen. Then, get a second keyboard so that you can rest your hands at or even a bit below a 90-degree angle. Your monitor should be positioned directly in front of you — to prevent twisting — and at about an arm’s length distance away. This will prevent you from overextending or craning your necks to reach it. </span></p>
<h3><b>Sweat the Details</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make your study spot a place you want to be in. Keep your space clean and tidy, and fill it with objects you love, but won’t find too distracting, like a pretty notebook or photo of your family. Plants are another great choice. Spending time in nature has been shown to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce stress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give you energy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help you feel happier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working by a window isn’t just pleasant — it’s good for you. According to <a href="https://www.workdesign.com/2017/05/harnessing-power-natural-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorkDesign</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural light can make you more engaged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and reduce headaches, eye strain, and blurred vision by as much as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">84 percent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, quiet is essential in order to be able to focus; </span><a href="https://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/compressed_WorldGBC_Health_Wellbeing__Productivity_Full_Report_Dbl_Med_Res_Feb_2015.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracting sounds can cause performance to drop by as much as 66 percent.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So make sure your study spot is somewhere you can actually concentrate. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, BrainStation expanded our </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/brainstation-expands-revolutionary-online-live-platform"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online learning options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – which we call Online Live – making online digital skills training accessible to learners around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Live has since delivered over 150,000 hours of live online instruction to Learners in 50 cities and 17 countries around the world. The future of education, we believe, is online, and the challenges presented by the COVID-19 outbreak have made that increasingly clear.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence to back up that belief. A survey of 1,000 online student learners found that 91 percent said it </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/are-online-courses-worth-it"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved their professional life </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 93 percent said it improved their resume.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, online education can have an impact on career success but it can be an adjustment for those more familiar with in-person learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re considering taking an </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#,online"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or have just started your online training, here are some expert tips for online learning from home.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing Your Learning Space</span></h2>
<p><b>Find a Quiet Space with no Distractions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general consensus among professionals working from home is to find a dedicated workspace. The same applies to those looking to study from home. Find yourself a space that can be dedicated to your online course, and make sure it’s a quiet, well-lit spot that you know you’ll be able to concentrate in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our most successful students tend to be those that have taken the time to create a dedicated study space that is comfortable and free from distraction,&#8221; says Trevor Martin, Digital Marketing Instructor at BrainStation. “Having a separate space reserved for your studies can also help you stay on top of your work and stay motivated in the same that going to a classroom would.”</span></p>
<p><b>Make Sure you Have a Strong Internet Connection</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing interrupts an online lesson like a bad internet connection. If you find your internet is not strong enough at home, look into options at your local library or a nearby co-working space. You might find that colleges or universities in your city have a library open to the public that will be popular amongst those looking for a quiet place to study.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Use a Dual Monitor if Available&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having two monitors is a nice-to-have when learning online. It allows you to see the instructor and classmates while also taking notes, testing out the curriculum, or referring to the deck slides. While this may not be necessary, if you do have a second monitor or tablet to display the course material, this is a good use case for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treat It Like an In-Person Class&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><b>Dress for Success</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that pyjamas are comfortable and relaxing, but that relaxed approach can have an impact on your mindset and motivation. Just like going to an in-person class with other ambitious professionals, you’ll want to dress for success. And besides, dressing the part will save you any embarrassment if you unexpectedly have to answer the door during the class while on camera.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Turn on the Camera</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the real advantages of an </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#,online"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online live course</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the ability to work with your classmates and get real-time feedback from your Instructor. Keeping your webcam on allows you to stay attentive to your fellow learners and signal your engagement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always ask Learners to keep their cameras on. It’s a much more personal and engaging experience that way, and I can more easily see which content is resonating, and when it might be time for a break,” Martin says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Ask Questions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need clarity on something, chances are one of your classmates does too. The benefit of Online Live is that you have an Instructor who can immediately help clear up any questions you might have.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be shy to ask questions when learning online, especially when it’s live online instruction. This is an opportunity to talk through ideas with an industry expert – take advantage of it! The other idea to remember is that questions often lead to engaging class discussions about real-life experiences and applications, all of which will improve you overall learning experience,” Martin says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Take Notes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t use online learning as an excuse to just sit back and listen. Most people retain information better when writing it down or translating it into their own words. In fact, according to Professor Walter Paulk at Cornell, only 10 percent of an audio lecture will remain in memory, but students who take and review notes can recall up to 80 percent of a lecture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using a second monitor, use it to take notes or keep a notebook and pen beside you to jot down key points and ideas.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the Most Out of Technology</span></h2>
<p><b>Participate in class forums</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online learning courses and programs use messaging systems to encourage collaboration and communication. BrainStation, for example, uses breakout rooms and Slack channels to connect students with their Instructors and classmates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from being a great tool to get feedback on your work, these channels can be a fantastic resource for finding and sharing content. For example, during a Data Analytics course, students might share interesting data visualizations they came across in the news that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of the best projects I’ve seen were born in class Slack channels,” says Martin. “Someone suggests an idea and people get excited about helping that person make it come to life.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Use Zoom and Other Collaboration Tools for Group Work</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many in the press have noted, we are currently engaging the world’s largest work-from-home experiment. It seems likely that when a level of normalcy returns to the world, remote work will become more commonplace. There is a secondary benefit to online learning, therefore, as it can provide a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with many of the leading digital collaboration and project management tools, like Zoom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tools are also an easy way for you to stay connected with your classmates and track progress on group work. Try setting up a standard weekly touchpoint with your group members to keep yourself on track.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Expand Your Network</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each learner will have different motivations for enrolling in an online course, but a real benefit may get overlooked is the ability to expand your network. </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/using-data-to-drive-community-at-lululemon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Max Smilie, the Regional Community Lead at Lululemon, took a BrainStation Certificate Course to become more data-savvy and ended up meeting like-minded professionals around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The people who are in the classes are all working to better themselves and are real go-getters; it felt like a family and I think that’s what made the class so special,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take the networking opportunity a step further, take notes about people’s roles and learning objectives and ask a few for 15-minute virtual “coffee chats” throughout the course. Also, make sure to add the connections you make on LinkedIn to stay in touch after the class.&nbsp;</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online education is making digital skills training more accessible than ever before, offering professionals of all levels a convenient path to career and personal development. But, some people may still be skeptical of online education, particularly of courses that use a “</span><a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/why-we-need-more-than-learn-at-your-own-pace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn at your own pace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” model. Completion rates for these types of online courses tend to hover between 0.5 percent to 10 percent, which is not very convincing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that, there is a growing body of evidence to support online learning. For example, a recent survey of 1,000 online student learners found that: 91 percent said it improved their professional life, 90 percent claimed it made them a more confident leader, and 93 percent said it improved their resume. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An even larger survey, featuring 52,000 respondents, found that 60 percent developed skills they were using in a new position, with 40 percent claiming it improved their candidacy for a new job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, online education can have an impact. That said, not all online courses are made the same. Here are some questions to ask when choosing an online certificate course.</span></p>
<h3><b>&#8220;Are the instructors experienced and currently working in the industry?&#8221;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ever had a great high school teacher, you know the impact they can have on your understanding and appreciation for a subject. The same is true in the online space, where the caliber of instructors can make a tangible difference. As Bill Gates said, “Technology is just a tool. In terms of getting the kids working together and motivating them, the teacher is the most important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the reasons why BrainStation launched Online Live, which gives professionals the chance to learn from industry experts through real-time, interactive lectures in an engaging, online classroom. It’s important to us that Instructors are currently working in the field so that they can update the curriculum on a daily basis and ensure that students are learning the very latest techniques and tools. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyvHTJMSSqk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, not all online courses will be live. This question, however, is still valid. Who is teaching this course? To get the most out of it, you will want to be taught by industry professionals who are up-to-date on the latest trends and also deeply experienced in the field. </span></p>
<h3><b>&#8220;How agile is the curriculum?&#8221;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to read the course package closely. Does it cover everything you’re looking to learn? What will you learn and how will you learn it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to look at how the curriculum is updated. One of the challenges in online instruction is not being fully aware of when content has been updated – the last thing you want to do is commit to studying something that is out of date. Ensuring that something is up to the minute (or at least updated on a regular basis) is the first step in making sure you’re not wasting your time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BrainStation, for example, works with industry leaders from the most innovative organizations in the world to develop and update course content on a daily basis, ensuring students are always learning the latest and most relevant tools and techniques. </span></p>
<h3><b>&#8220;How flexible is the course schedule?&#8221;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have work, school, friends, and a to-do list as long as your arm. There isn’t much value in an online course if you can’t find one that fits your schedule. The trick is giving yourself the time you’ll need to truly succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools that offer lectures in multiple time zones helps create flexibility for professionals and entire teams to work remotely and access premium digital skills training. </span></p>
<h3><b>&#8220;Is there a live-lecture option?&#8221;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned above, the live element is hard to discount when you’re thinking of online education.  According to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at SUNY Albany</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “attendance” was the single most important predictor of high grades, beating out SAT scores, high school GPAs, study skills or habits. The difference-maker was that they benefited from regular face time with a subject matter expert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When instructors are not available to answer questions, students struggle, which can lead to dropping out. In fact, one </span><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/research/csrmaj/daniel_onah_edulearn14.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that one of the primary causes of MOOC dropout was the lack of instructor support provided when the course becomes challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Harman Singh, Founder of WizIQ, </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3034600/can-people-really-learn-at-their-own-pace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “The real problem is when you get stuck, no matter how motivated you are, you can’t get through a concept. I need an instructor, a teacher, to help me get through some tough subjects.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the reasons why Online Live has been such a tremendous success. With world-class Instructors broadcasting industry-leading content out of our learning studios, Online Live has resulted in more than 100,000 hours of live learning for thousands of professionals across 50 cities and 27 states, provinces, and territories across North America.</span></p>
<h3><b>&#8220;Are they using cutting-edge technology to support your learning?&#8221; </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were applying to study at a university or college, you would most likely go to visit their campus, wouldn’t you? The same is true in the online learning space – you want your online classroom to be as intuitive, seamless, and interactive as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Live, for example, is powered by Synapse, our unique, proprietary learning management system, which allows students to attend live lectures, interact with your Instructor and peers in real-time, and access additional training materials. Synapse is the world’s first data-driven learning management system, and it is constantly evolving and refining its user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal was for the platform to be a seamless extension of the learning experience at BrainStation’s campuses, putting an emphasis on collaboration and connectivity. </span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning management systems (LMS) have been around for roughly 20 years, but their importance has only increased with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the digital economy&#8217;s rapid pace of change.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from the Association for Talent Development found that 83 percent of surveyed learning professionals confirmed current LMS use, and 71 percent said they had seen an increase in use over the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the specific features and functions of different learning management systems vary, an LMS allows an organization to deploy and track online training initiatives while also providing a home hub for all kinds of important information. More robust learning management systems, like BrainStation’s </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/synapse-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse learning platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can offer a host of other features, even allowing students to attend live lectures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your organization is considering taking the leap, here are some of the many benefits you can expect by investing in a learning management system.</span></p>
<h3><b>An LMS Will Save Your Organization Money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATD Research’s 2018 State of the Industry report found that organizations spent $1,296 per employee on learning, a 1.7 percent increase over the year before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So organizations are already investing in continuing education, but an LMS can help focus those efforts and ensure that investment isn’t going to waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s especially true for smaller organizations with limited HR staff, but even in larger organizations with more resources, an LMS can significantly reduce the amount of time your HR department has to spend running training sessions, directing employees to important resources, or responding to queries where answers are easily available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Succession planning also becomes significantly easier when all training materials and programs are centralized and accessible, and likewise, an LMS makes the process of onboarding new hires a breeze – getting your employees up to speed faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, using online classrooms and learning spaces is much more efficient in terms of both time and money than sending employees to in-person training or continuing education programs, which can also include travel and hotel expenses.</span></p>
<h3><b>It Can Provide A better, Deeper Learning Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your employees, an LMS can provide the most convenient, enjoyable and – most importantly – educationally effective training experience possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An LMS will give your employees 24-hour access to the learning materials and resources they need, with the flexibility to learn at the office or from home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And particularly robust LMS will take that educational experience even farther.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Synapse allows for seamless, responsive real-time feedback that allows for faster and deeper comprehension and engagement. Further, thanks to social learning features across different mediums, students using Synapse will still get the full experience of engaging and networking with classmates and instructors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since Synapse is the world’s first data-driven learning platform, instructors have the ability to track the comprehension of course content to develop a personalized learning experience for each student. Synapse also presents instructor comments on coursework right next to the project requirements, creating a constructive feedback loop that learners appreciate.</span></p>
<h3><b>You Can Track, Report, and Manage Progress</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an LMS, you won’t need to wonder how your employees are faring in their training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A learning management system will allow you to pay careful attention to where employees are in the training process as well as which concepts are proving particularly engaging or challenging. That allows organizations to identify opportunities for further training, areas of organizational weakness, or even employee strengths they might not otherwise have identified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those advanced reporting functions also give you a real sense of the ROI of your training efforts, so you’ll no longer need to guess about their effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those progress management tools are especially crucial within organizations that require any amount of compliance training.</span></p>
<h3><b>Positioning your company for the future</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the capacity to feature multimedia learning tools, to encourage remote digital communication, and to incorporate the very latest in eLearning trends and strategies, a good learning management system will ensure your company is providing the most current and innovative learning experience for your employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the benefits run even deeper as you look forward. We mentioned that succession planning becomes easier with the adoption of an LMS, but it’s even possible that a good LMS might not simply make those transitions easier, but also reduce turnover overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Kronos study found that 87 percent of HR managers polled called improved retention a high or critical priority. If you’re among that group, consider a recent Gallup study that found 87 percent of millennials rate “professional or career growth and development opportunities” as one of the top factors in whether they stay in a job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, a robust LMS won’t just help you empower and enrich your employees, it may also help you attract and keep the best talent as well.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s get one thing straight: We love MOOCs and &#8216;learn at your own pace&#8217; training options.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flexibility and convenience offered by these kinds of learning models have made digital skills training much more accessible than ever before. The trouble is,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">completion rates for these kinds of courses and programs have traditionally been very low, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with rates&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/03/08/researchers-explore-who-taking-moocs-and-why-so-many-drop-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere from 0.5 percent to 10 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why that is may have a lot to do with human nature.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s why we need more than &#8216;learn at your own pace&#8217; learning models. </span></p>



<p><b>Learners Need to Attend to Succeed</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654310362998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at SUNY Albany</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, student success is directly related to student attendance. In fact, they concluded that attendance is the single most important predictor of high grades, a better predictor than SAT scores, high school GPA, study skills, or study habits. Their meta-analysis incorporated almost a century of data and included more than 28,000 student outcomes, leading them to conclude that “the use of the online classroom resources and improved textbooks have not decreased the importance of attending class.” </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, a causal effect of absence on student performance was determined by </span><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2008/twerp_820.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">University of Warwick researchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who studied undergraduate Economics students over a period of three years. High-performing students’ grades were hardest hit by cutting classes. Likewise, class attendance was </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.11120/ened.2010.05010064" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statistically proven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be a “key determinant of academic performance” for Engineering students at the University of Exeter, even when students had unlimited and unrestricted access to online lecture notes. </span></p>



<p><b>Learners Need Access to Expertise</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does attendance make such a difference for course performance? In the Warwick and Exeter studies, all students had access to online course materials and textbooks. Only those students who attended the in-class lectures and tutorials had access to instructors. They benefited from regular face time with a subject matter expert. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major challenge with learning on your own can be if you get stuck on a concept, a task, or a problem sequence. When instructors are not readily accessible to take questions, students tend to flounder. Instructors also articulate the metacognitive framework for what’s being studied; essentially, they help students appreciate and develop best practices for learning. A </span><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/research/csrmaj/daniel_onah_edulearn14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study conducted by the University of Warwick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that one of the primary causes of MOOC dropout was the lack of instructor support provided when the course becomes challenging.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, a few exceptional students do just fine cutting class until the day of the exam. But these people are just that, an exception. Live interaction with a knowledgeable instructor remains an important component of learning, for many reasons. Harman Singh, Founder of WizIQ, explained one of the most common to </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3034600/can-people-really-learn-at-their-own-pace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “The real problem is when you get stuck, no matter how motivated you are, you can’t get through a concept. I need an instructor, a teacher, to help me get through some tough subjects.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><b>Learners Need Other Students</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attendance is also crucial for how it feeds student engagement. This was a lesson learned by Harvard Professor David J. Malan, who now encourages regular attendance for his popular 800-student Introduction to Computer Science course. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2016/17 school year, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@cs50/this-shall-be-cs50-2016-faed96945f81" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malan told students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they need only attend the first and last class meetings. The rest of the semester they would have free and open access to the course material online, and could choose to learn on their own, however, and whenever they wished. He </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGtWHikRGMWMDpAsB41l7nuWHjnJ_G4-BDp1asK6xaE/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversed that decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2017/18 school year, </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/05/professor-who-teaches-harvards-largest-class-says-students-should-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telling </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Higher Ed</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “enough former students reported something was missing, not just the students themselves but the energy of the audience, that we decided to bring live lectures back this fall.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning plainly has a social component; students enjoy and benefit from the participation of others in the class. This might be especially true in continuing education and professional training, where the life and workplace experience of adult students can be considerable. More importantly, peers can be a huge source of motivation and inspiration, in the same way that having workout buddies can make the tough stuff fun and keep you on track – even when life gets hectic. </span></p>



<p><b>Learners Need Timelines and Deadlines</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, another time-honored source of extrinsic motivation is deadlines. Course timelines and deadlines hold students accountable, spurring them to produce, keep up, and complete their work. In the &#8216;learn at your own pace&#8217; model, timelines and deadlines are negotiable, at best, non-existent, at worst.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadlines can be inconvenient, but how many of us can accomplish non-trivial things like higher education without them? If the stats on MOOCs are any indication, less than 10% of us. While self-implemented deadlines can help with procrastination, a </span><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.00441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study conducted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Psychologist Dan Ariely explains that they aren’t nearly as effective as those that are externally imposed. </span></p>



<p><b>Complementing ‘Learn At Your Own Pace’</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s in a lecture hall or via a virtual classroom, live, real-time interaction with instructors gives students the interaction and guidance they need –&nbsp;and this is why ‘learn at your own pace’ models often fall short. What’s needed is a middle ground that combines the flexibility of online learning options, with the interaction, support, and structure of instructor-led training. Creating this was the driving force behind BrainStation’s Online Live course offerings, which are powered by <a href="https://brainstation.io/synapse-learning-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synapse, our very own data-driven learning platform</a>. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse lets our learners attend live lectures, collaborate with other professionals, and get immediate feedback from expert Instructors — just as they would in one of BrainStation’s campuses. So far, the reaction (and student performance) has been tremendous.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge for educators and learners alike is to continue developing these types of platforms and methodologies, to ensure we’re balancing an increased demand for online education with the way people actually learn. We’re on the right track.</span></p>
