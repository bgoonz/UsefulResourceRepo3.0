								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meet Sarah McVean, a Senior Product Designer and BrainStation Design Instructor. Having taught multiple courses at BrainStation including </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/design-thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/user-experience-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">User Experience Design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sarah has helped empower professionals with the skills they need – and in the process, she developed the skills she needed to take the next step in her career. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke to Sarah about the design process, landing a new role at Shopify, and what it’s like to be a BrainStation Instructor.</span></p>



<h3><b>BrainStation: Can you tell us a bit about your career background, and what you do currently?</b></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2.jpg" alt="Design Instructor" class="wp-image-8994" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2.jpg 2372w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-109x109.jpg 109w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-100x100.jpg 100w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sarah-Short-Hair-2-960x960.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 2372px) 100vw, 2372px" /></figure></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McVean: I’ve been a designer for 18 years, starting my career out in Multimedia with a focus on web design. I’ve done a bit of everything over the years, which has been the benefit of being a strong generalist, but my focus has typically been in the area of UX/UI for website and product design. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My most recent role was as a Senior Product Designer at KPMG’s Ignition Centre, where I led strategy, design, and Design Thinking for KPMG’s teams, partners and clients. I’m moving into a role as a UX Manager at Shopify, which I will be starting next month and am very excited about because, well, it’s Shopify and I’ll have the opportunity to grow a lot there.</span></p>



<h3><b>What drew you to the field of Product and UX Design?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About ten years ago, I began working at a software company where I worked not only on the marketing materials and website, but also on a product for food safety. The product was really interesting, and it was a natural transition for me from doing web over the years, but I had to learn how to work with complexity and UI patterns that I didn’t typically use in web. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I primarily performed UI design until I started to learn more about user research, usability testing, and UX deliverables and workflow. Once I began learning about including users in the design process, I was super excited, because otherwise design can be very subjective. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating research and data gave me the confidence to make decisions and speak to stakeholders from the needs of the users. This was a dramatic shift from the previous way I had been doing design work.</span></p>



<h3><b>In your opinion what’s the most critical aspect of a user-centric design process?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the most crucial aspect is for the designer to be able to adapt the process to meet the context of the work she is doing and fit user research in – even if it’s less than she’d like – making it measurable in some way. This will help show the value of user-centric design to the stakeholders, and get buy-in for more time and resources to perform user research. Being able to adjust your process and expectations to meet the needs of the company is key to helping to transition and implement a robust user-centred methodology. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is for the designer not to bring bias to the interview or testing process. We shouldn’t be looking for validation of our ideas but to disprove our assumptions. Designers can get attached to solutions, and designing for the user requires us to take a step back and design for their best interests, even though it may not align with what we want to create.</span></p>



<h3><b>Can you describe your experience as a BrainStation Instructor?</b> <b>What is your favourite part of teaching at BrainStation?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team here at BrainStation has always been very welcoming and supportive, and I’ve had the opportunity to make connections with students from various backgrounds and provide meaningful support and direction to new designers. Watching them grow has been very rewarding.</span></p>



<h3><b>Did working as an Instructor at BrainStation help you in your personal professional development? </b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, most definitely. I originally taught a Design Thinking workshop at BrainStation, which led me to my previous role at KPMG where I was a Senior Product Designer and Design Thinking Facilitator. I gained a lot of skills leading and facilitating sessions during the day at KPMG and in the evening at BrainStation. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of public speaking, teaching, and facilitation, I have grown exponentially. I also think that teaching at BrainStation helped me get my new role at Shopify.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m very grateful for the growth I’ve experienced while working at BrainStation.</span></p>



<h3><b>What is a teaching moment or student success story that you’re most proud of?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well I think there are a few moments, but one is a Product Manager who came to learn UX because he thought his lack of wireframing and UX skills were hindering his job opportunities in the market. A few months after the course he got a new job as a Director of Product and said that the UX course was key for him getting that new role! </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another student came in with virtually no design experience and turned out a final project that was so amazing, it was on par with many experienced designers work. It was very gratifying to see someone do so well in such a short amount of time.</span></p>



<h3><b>In your experience, what do students find most challenging about the user experience design process?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think listening to feedback from usability testing and not trying to ‘explain’ designs to the user. This can be difficult sometimes, especially from designers who may have experience delivering work without any user feedback. It can be challenging to watch someone struggle with your design, so it’s a learned skill to step back and accept the feedback without getting defensive.</span></p>



<h3><b>Based on your experience working in UX, how relevant and applicable is the BrainStation approach to skills training?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the BrainStation course material and projects are a fantastic real-world introduction into current methodologies, concepts and tools. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The course material is continuously being updated and worked on which is necessary since our industry is always evolving at a rapid-fire pace. And the projects themselves that students create are tangible assets that can be used towards portfolio pieces or simply for practice, and they follow the same steps that hiring managers look for when reviewing portfolios of past work. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are serious about becoming a UX designer, BrainStation is a great start, and I also encourage designers to continuously learn new skills and do design work, as the UX profession is a journey where the learning never ends.</span></p>



<h3><b>In your opinion, what are the most valuable skills a professional working in UX can develop?</b></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication skills. This is very nuanced, and is a skill I’m always working on myself, but the ability to present your work, discuss ideas on a team, defend your designs and listen to feedback is so important. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much more to design than the pixels, and there is a balance between listening to others opinions and leading the process. Communication is a key factor in what makes a successful designer. Especially now that more teams work remotely, communication skills are really key. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I encourage everyone to put themselves into situations where they may feel uncomfortable so that there are opportunities for growth. And listen to understand, not just waiting for the opportunity to reply.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Designer, Consultant, and Podcast Creator are just a handful of roles that BrainStation Design Instructor, Gerard Dolan, fills on a day-to-day basis. Dolan has worked in the design field for more than two decades, and has taught multiple <a href="https://brainstation.io/courses#design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design courses</a> at BrainStation, including User Experience Design, User Interface Design, and Design Thinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignleft wp-image-8131" src="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gerard-Sans-sticky-on-head-.jpg" alt="Design Instructor" width="278" height="418" srcset="https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gerard-Sans-sticky-on-head-.jpg 466w, https://d1jxdyr49kipv5.cloudfront.net/prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gerard-Sans-sticky-on-head--200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" />We spoke to Gerard about what drew him to UX, why he created his podcast, and what it’s like to be a BrainStation Instructor.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Design as a Natural Next Step</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With UX gaining popularity over the course of the past several years, individuals from many different professional backgrounds are scrambling to build their design skills and transition into the field. This is so commonplace, we often forget that for some professionals, UX design was a natural next step. “I come from a traditional art, design, branding background, having studied at OCAD (Ontario College of Art and Design), that always stressed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of projects,” says Dolan. “UX was a natural progression based on this training.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Dolan works in consulting for UX, strategy, and product design. “I’m generally engaged at the start of projects when there’s plenty of ambiguity to go around,” says Dolan. “My role is to make the complex simple, and to make the design solution compelling for the customer and relevant to a business driver.” Dolan’s work allows him to be at the epicentre of design and business, and gives him a firm grasp on how these two elements influence one another. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BrainStation Experience </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dolan’s knowledge and expertise is something he brings to BrainStation students every class, providing them with insight into what it’s like to work in the design field. He believes in the power of BrainStation to prepare students for the workforce. “The UX skills training at BrainStation gives a solid foundation and direction for an individual to enter the discipline,” says Dolan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Gerard sharing his own experience, but he’s constantly learning from other UX professionals through his podcast. “Basically, I was tied to the office working and traveling for business. I could barely make it to conferences, and I’m no good if I’m lacking creative input. So I decided to reach out directly to those I wished to have a conversation with,” explains Dolan about his motivation for the podcast. “Many of these conversations have helped me formulate and stress test my processes.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting the UX Discovery Session Podcast</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UX Discovery Session was named one of the best UX podcasts in 2018, and features discussions with various design thought leaders from diverse organizations and industries about new ideas, emerging techniques, and whatever else comes to mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The interview format I decided on helps the audience relate to the interviewees as people,” says Dolan. “The blue sky question for example, ‘If money and time weren&#8217;t an object, is there a project (or an area of interest) you would wish to initiate?’, has had some pretty great answers. Everything from charitable work, to fixing the California transportation licensing office, to wanting to be a cheese farmer.”</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/503520759&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And isn’t relating to others what UX is all about? Empathizing with the user so that you can better understand their needs, and ultimately, create a solution that meets them. According to Gerard Dolan, the most important skill a UX Designer can have is “listening to and analyzing the ambiguity. Identifying patterns that exist and providing a solid point of view for a relevant solution for the customer and the business.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gerard brings his passion for design and learning to every class he instructs at BrainStation. “[My favourite part] is having a positive impact on the careers of the students,” says Dolan. “I&#8217;m very fortunate to have met so many talented people in this role.”</span></p>

<p>We asked Liang about how she got involved in iOS development and whether she had any insight for individuals looking to get started in this field. Here&#8217;s what she had to say.</p>
<p><b>BrainStation: What was it that first interested you in iOS development? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang: After getting my first iPhone 3GS, I wanted to find an app that alerted me when I got home, but I couldn&#8217;t find one in the App Store. So I decided to learn how to make an app myself.</span></p>
<p><b>What advice would you give people looking to break into in your field?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of an app idea that gets you excited and start making it today. It&#8217;s really that simple. You have to just dive in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have no clue where to start, Apple has pretty good documentation. I would recommend reading that before you start searching on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">StackOverflow or trying to hack something together just to make things work.</span></p>
<p><b>What key takeaways have you learned in your career trajectory? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think people realize it, but you will need to understand both the technical side and the business side of the app that you are working on. What this means is asking and knowing the answers to questions like: What features will people want? Why should they pay for this service? How do they use it? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, you have to know your users, and what they&#8217;re looking for. Only then can you be a better developer. </span></p>
<p><b>How have you witnessed iOS development evolve as a discipline?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It used to be a pretty isolated area, with Objective-C and a fairly closed ecosystem. However, right now, you have open source Swift, which you can use for scripting; you can also try server-side Swift, and Swift for Tensorflow, which just came out. Basically, with every new innovation, new doors open. The possibilities are unlimited.</span></p>
<p><b>Can you recommend any books to read, or events to attend for professional or personal development purposes?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612">Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> are both good places to start when it comes to books. If you&#8217;re looking for conferences, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> (Apple&#8217;s conference for developers) is a great even to attend. It can be very helpful knowing what other devs are working on, and how you can help each other get the job done easier, faster, and better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the end of the day, it doesn&#8217;t matter how many books you&#8217;ve read or how many conferences badges you&#8217;ve collected, it&#8217;s how much you understand the architecture, language, tools, and platforms that really makes a difference.</span></p>

<p>Meet Nada, one of our industry leading Instructors for the <a href="https://brainstation.io/course/online/data-science">Data Science course</a> at our Vancouver Campus. Apart from her data science background, Nada also has experience in consulting. Today she&#8217;s a data scientist at Microsoft and is constantly leading research and machine learning projects. Here are some of her insights into this trending topic, and what it&#8217;s like teaching at BrainStation.</p>
<p><b>BrainStation: What would you say is the biggest misconception others have about data science?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nada: One of the biggest misconceptions about data science is that you need to have access to lots of data to drive insights. That’s not always the case. Though having a large volume of data is helpful, insights can be driven from data that is rich in variety or veracity. What is important is having the RIGHT data to be able to drive competitive edge. A key component to being a great data scientist is being able to figure out what critical pieces of data are necessary to answer the hypotheses at hand.</span></p>
<p><b>What aspects of your career in data science do you love the most?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many aspects of data science that I love. Mostly, I love solving problems and sharing insights with colleagues and others. Even the smallest insights have a big impact, and it is always a joy to see those insights help form informed business decisions and shape the products in question.</span></p>
<p><b>What key takeaways have you learned in your career trajectory?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My career trajectory has taught me that there is no one right way to solve a problem. <a href="https://brainstation.io/blog/what-is-data-science">What is data science?</a> Data science is simply a means to an end, and data scientists come from an array of different backgrounds. We are tasked with identifying a problem and then solving it by whatever methods we determine are best. It is always fun to be in control of the narrative, but it is also an immense amount of responsibility. The path we take to connect the dots is completely ours.</span></p>
<p><b>In your experience as a data scientist, how relevant and applicable is the BrainStation approach to data skills training?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstation’s data science course teaches individuals the fundamentals of programming in Python, to create algorithms using basic statistical methods, and to understand advanced data structures and models. Armed with those skills, students will have the skills and tools to collect, wrangle, and analyze data. All of these skills not only allow the students to effectively communicate insights, as data scientists, to a wide array of audiences, but also help organizations tackle many problems from different domains.</span></p>
<p><b>As an instructor at BrainStation, what do you want your students to leave with?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like my students to leave with the necessary tools to tackle any data science problem thrown at them. Ideally, the students would leave with an excitement towards data, the ability to ask the right questions to solve the problem at hand, and the flexibility to learn new skills to remain on top of their game.</span></p>
