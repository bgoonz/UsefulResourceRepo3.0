To show your enthusiasm, write a custom cover letter for each role you apply to. You can reuse a few sentences or phrases across your cover letters, but overall it should be personalized and relevant to the role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Research the company<\/strong>: Learn about what they do and who their customers are. In your cover letter, mention ways your social media skills could help them build their brand and engage their audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Expand on your resume<\/strong>: Your cover letter should not regurgitate your resume. Expand on the points listed on your resume and explain why your achievements make you a great candidate for the role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focus on what you can do for them<\/strong>: Frame your cover letter around how you can help them achieve success. First, identify the company\u2019s problems or pain points. Then, explain why your skills and experiences make you the perfect person to solve their problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Highlight the right skills and experience<\/strong>: You may be skilled in all areas of social media, but you should focus your cover letter on what the company actually needs. Review the job description and identify the most essential skills and qualifications for the position. In your cover letter, share experiences that relate those skills and qualifications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Always proofread<\/strong>: Communication is an essential skill for all Social Media Specialists. Your cover letter is where you can show the employer just how strong your writing skills are. Make sure you edit and proofread before submitting any job application.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"getting-started---what-is-the-purpose-of-the-cover-letter?\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">Getting Started &#8211; What is the Purpose of the Cover Letter?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1\">\n<p>The cover letter is meant to introduce you to a potential employer.
