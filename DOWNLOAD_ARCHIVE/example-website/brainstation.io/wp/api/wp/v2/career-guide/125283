This involves building out a cohesive plan that suits overarching company goals, strategizing tactics to achieve those goals, and generally exploring, testing, and optimizing different social media channels to suit a brand\u2019s audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The steps of a Social Media Manager can be broken down into strategizing, engaging, creating, scheduling, listening, measuring, and experimenting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you\u2019ll need to establish a specific goal (such as traffic or registrations), and align your social media tactics to meet that goal. For example, if you\u2019re looking to build awareness amongst young shoppers, you might decide to build an influencer program on Instagram.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, you\u2019ll need to engage with your audience on social, build a brand voice and create content that resonates with your audience. Each channel has its own algorithm and tactics for optimization, in this way, scheduling is also a big part of what Social Media Specialists do, ensuring that posts are scheduled regularly and at optimal days and times on specific channels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As those elements are established, a Social Media Specialist also needs to measure results by tracking metrics and insights on each platform. There are tools that help consolidate these results so that it\u2019s easy to see which channels are most effective and what content elicit the most engagement. With this data, Social Media Specialists are able to experiment with new content and optimize high-performing posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Social Media Specialists will also be responsible for paid strategies and will need to be adept at using tools such as Facebook Ads Manager or other paid options on channels like LinkedIn or Quora, for example.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"social-media-specialist-job-description\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">Social Media Specialist Job Description<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1\">\n<p>Social Media Specialist responsibilities could vary depending on the job and the size and configuration of the overall digital marketing team, but the standard Social Media Specialist job description on most job boards will likely list all or most of the following job responsibilities:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Develop, implement and manage our social media strategy after conducting competitive research, platform determination, messaging and audience identification<\/li><li>Plan, create, publish and share new content (including original text, images, video and code) on a daily basis that builds meaningful customer connections, increases brand awareness and encourages community members to engage with the brand<\/li><li>Collaborate with sales and marketing teams to develop social media campaigns<\/li><li>Stay up to date with the latest social media best practices and technologies<\/li><li>Set up and optimize company pages within each platform to increase the visibility of company\u2019s social content<\/li><li>Monitor SEO and customer engagement and suggest content optimization<\/li><li>Moderate user-generated content in line with the moderation policy<\/li><li>Collaborate with sales, web design, web development, digital marketing, customer relations and product development teams<\/li><li>Create editorial calendars and syndication schedules<\/li><li>Capture and analyze the appropriate social data\/metrics, insights and social media best practices to measure the success of every social media campaign, then use that information to refine future campaigns<\/li><li>Work with copywriters and designers to ensure content is informative and appealing<\/li><li>Bolster your network by interacting with industry professionals and influencers via social media<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"what-does-a-social-media-specialist-do-all-day?\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">What Does a Social Media Specialist Do All Day?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1\">\n<p>Social Media Specialists spend their days planning and executing social media strategy, creating and publishing content to a variety of platforms, and interacting with their communities and audiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Social Media Specialist also needs to measure results by tracking metrics and insights on each platform.

They write social copy, communicate with the public through comments, and always keep an eye on what\u2019s trending. They also need to have an awareness of key influencers in their industry to spread their brand message and make valuable connections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social Media Specialists also track and analyze social media KPIs and check up on ROI. And don\u2019t forget: they also publish and promote content on social media, usually by scheduling it in advance with the help of an editorial calendar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Social Media Specialists usually have social strategy as an important part of their role, Social Media Strategists make it their top priority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally speaking, they plan an organization\u2019s strategy around marketing, advertising and finding new leads. They also likely are involved with performing audits to evaluate the effectiveness of their strategy.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-content-navigation-footer bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__links-container\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-container\"><p class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-title bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link--desktop\">Previous Article<\/p><a class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-many-people-use-social-media\"><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper--left\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\" fill=\"none\" class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon--left\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M6.345 12.743a1 1 0 001.31 1.511l5.477-4.749a1 1 0 000-1.511l-5.477-4.75a1.001 1.001 0 00-1.31 1.512l4.606 3.993-4.606 3.994z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-text bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link--desktop\"> How Many People Use Social Media?<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-container\"><p class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-title\"> Next Article<\/p><a class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/what-tools-do-social-media-specialists-use\"><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-text\">  What Tools Do Social Media Specialists Use?<\/span><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper--right\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\" fill=\"none\" class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon--right\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M6.345 12.743a1 1 0 001.31 1.511l5.477-4.749a1 1 0 000-1.511l-5.477-4.75a1.001 1.001 0 00-1.31 1.512l4.606 3.993-4.606 3.994z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide\/125283"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/types\/career-guide"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide\/125283\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":125543,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide\/125283\/revisions\/125543"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=125283"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=125283"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=125283"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
