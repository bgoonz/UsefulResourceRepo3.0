Although you will likely need formal education or training of some kind, you can start down this career path by building your social media following and growing your personal brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many working in the field today start with digital marketing courses or bootcamps, as these are the fastest ways to fast-track a career in social media. However, you can start on the path to a career in social media marketing by experimenting with your own passion projects, entrepreneurial endeavours, or by helping small businesses with their social media accounts. That\u2019s a great way to build your resume while making connections that could pay dividends down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to become a Social Media Specialist in seven steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#establish-your-social-media-presence\">Establish your social media presence<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#learn-social-media-marketing-fundamentals\">Learn social media marketing fundamentals<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#measure-social-media-campaigns-with-analytics\">Measure social media campaigns with analytics<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#get-creative-with-your-social-media-content\">Get creative with your social media content<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#stay-flexible-and-be-aware-of-social-media-trends\">Stay flexible and be aware of social media trends<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#build-a-social-media-portfolio\">Build a social media portfolio<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-to-become-a-social-media-specialist#apply-to-relevant-social-media-jobs\">Apply to relevant social media jobs<\/a><\/li><\/ol>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"establish-your-social-media-presence\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">1.

If they see profiles associated with you with little-to-no activity \u2013 or, even worse, anything inappropriate \u2013 you can bet they\u2019ll be looking elsewhere for their next social media pro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But don\u2019t think of this stage just as a time to manage risks. Polishing your social media channels until they shine \u2013 and we recommend getting a profile on every widely used platform, both for greater visibility and to give you more practice with the apps and platforms you\u2019ll likely need to master later \u2013 is the best first step you can take toward showing an employer or potential client that although you don\u2019t have years of experience, you have a knack for interesting and on-trend content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put time and effort into growing your following and interacting with the online community in a constructive and positive way. Community management is a big part of any Social Media Specialist\u2019s job and it can only help if employers see how well you conduct yourself.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"learn-social-media-marketing-fundamentals\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">2.

Further, you\u2019ll make valuable networking contacts with other social media professionals trying to break in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BrainStation, as just one example, offers full-time diploma courses in Digital Marketing both online and in person, as well as part-time certification courses in Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Marketing, and Digital Marketing. Course curriculum focuses on building measurable, end-to-end social campaigns with a variety of platforms, including: Business Manager for Instagram and Facebook, and LinkedIn Campaign Manager.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In as little as 12 weeks, you will build a portfolio under the tutelage of industry experts and become deeply familiar with concepts like brand strategy, analytics, search marketing, and email marketing.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"measure-social-media-campaigns-with-analytics\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">3.

According to eMarketer, 61 percent of Marketers say measuring ROI is their top challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, three other challenges in the survey\u2019s top five are directly related to ROI measurement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Tying social to business goals (33 percent)<\/li><li>Tracking results via a dashboard (27 percent)<\/li><li>Understanding performance across social channels (25 percent)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, you will need to be adept with analytics to improve the effectiveness of your campaigns and social content, and ultimately, to prove your value to a company.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"get-creative-with-your-social-media-content\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">4.

Pay close attention to what works and what doesn\u2019t and refine your approach accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also a time to develop your unique voice. Although you might eventually need to adapt to fit the voice of whatever brand or company you\u2019re creating content for, it\u2019s still important to be able to demonstrate to an employer that you can post social media content across multiple platforms with a consistent voice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency really is key. Brands need to have a consistent voice across all social media platforms, so showing that you understand how to do that is crucial to showing potential employers that they can trust you to handle their accounts.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"stay-flexible-and-be-aware-of-social-media-trends\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">5.

You must be constantly aware of what your competitors are doing, what people are talking about, what people are saying about you, and which design or content trends seem to be resonating. And you must be ready to pivot at a moment\u2019s notice based on the news of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media never stops or slows down, so it can be overwhelming trying to stay on top of everything. Fortunately, there are plenty of tools, apps, and platforms out there that help Social Media Specialists keep their fingers on the pulse of the Internet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Trends helps you see what people are searching for on a macro level. Hootsuite will help you monitor trends across a number of different social media platforms, Geofeedia helps you see what\u2019s trending in different regions, while Social Mention not only gives you the chance to see what people are talking about on different platforms, it can also tell you if the mentions of a certain keyword or phrase are associated with positive, negative or neutral sentiments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also do research on which special awareness dates or other milestones tend to provoke a lot of reaction on social media and plan content ahead of time.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"build-a-social-media-portfolio\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">6.

Whether you can land a freelance assignment at this stage or you\u2019ve decided to work on a passion project, you must begin to build your portfolio to eventually land a job as a Social Media Specialist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not try launching a blog or website? Or try curating an eye-catching Instagram page or compelling YouTube channel. You could pen your own newsletter or start putting together an expert Pinterest board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Social Media Specialists in scarce supply and many companies still in the fledgling phase of establishing a really solid social media presence, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to be assertive and land freelance work contributing to a company\u2019s social media strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed alone shows more than 3,500 freelance social media projects available, some paying as much as $100 an hour if you can demonstrate you have some experience.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\" id=\"apply-to-relevant-social-media-jobs\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">7.

Social Media Coordinators draft and post content, including tweets and status messages. The Social Media Coordinator is usually also responsible for setting up alerts to manage responses and monitoring what is being said about clients. They also work alongside management to set the strategy for how to respond. Indeed shows more than 13500 Social Media Coordinator positions open in the U.S., with hourly wages of up to $21.15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next rung up the ladder is the Social Media Specialist, who will have more input into overall strategy and a bigger role in steering content from a creative point of view. It\u2019s one of the hottest positions in digital marketing right now \u2013 Indeed shows nearly 13,500 jobs available with that title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the management-level roles in social media are Social Media Manager and Social Media Director. Management-level roles for social media professionals are often more focused on strategy and less about posting status messages or determining which Facebook pages to like or which Twitter profiles to follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duties differ based on a client\u2019s needs. For example, some may focus more on contests to promote products, and others involve knowing more about competitors. Of course, Social Media Directors have the highest salaries, making over $66,000 on average in the U.S., with senior workers at big companies making much more.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">Is Social Media a Growing Field?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1\">\n<p>Yes, social media is a field growing as fast as almost any other \u2013 Forrester forecasts that digital marketing spend will reach $146 billion by 2023 and social media and other digital marketing roles grew 30 percent faster from 2011 to 2016 than overall marketing postings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now more than 3.6 billion social media users in the world, with 56 percent of all adults using more than one platform on a regular basis, and as much as 90 percent of all companies using social media for marketing. The number of users is expected to swell further \u2013 all the way to 4.4 billion people in 2025, according to numbers from Statista.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook alone now has approximately 2.5 billion monthly active users. With Americans spending nearly two hours per day browsing social media, that\u2019s a huge captive audience for companies to try to reach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That explains why research from Burning Glass Technologies showed that four in 10 marketing job openings now call for digital marketing skills, and the number of postings calling for digital skills nearly doubled between 2011 and 2016. Further, digital marketing roles grew 30 percent faster over that period than overall marketing postings.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">What Is the Salary of a Social Media Specialist?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1\">\n<p>According to Glassdoor, the average salary for a Social Media Specialist is just over $48,000 and can rise up to $66,000.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h2 has-text-align-left\"><h2 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">How Do I Become a Social Media Specialist With No Experience?<\/h2><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-indented-content-container bstn-blocks-indented-content-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-indented-content-container__content col col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-1\">\n<p>Even if you have no experience, there are many paths to becoming a Social Media Specialist, especially since there\u2019s nothing stopping you from getting out there on your own, exploring the latest social media platforms and technology, learning how to create good content, and beginning to build your following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s just the first step toward finding your niche as a Social Media Specialist. You will likely want to consider attending a social media marketing course or digital marketing bootcamp. It\u2019s not uncommon for agencies or companies to hire people right upon completing a bootcamp, especially with such a high demand currently for Digital Marketers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Marketers also start in generalist positions and decide to shift into social media as their specialty. Some even specialize in one specific platform, which can be an especially effective strategy when freelancing \u2013 a company may already have a Twitter or Facebook page but they might need someone particularly adept at TikTok, for example, to get their account off the ground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t have experience and are starting from scratch, you\u2019ll likely have to start at a more entry-level marketing role. Luckily, entry-level social media marketing positions are hardly scarce given the state of the industry, so if you have a knack for knowing how to communicate with an audience digitally, you\u2019ll likely find yourself climbing the ladder in no time.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-content-navigation-footer bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__links-container\"><div class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-container\"><p class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-title bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link--desktop\">Previous Article<\/p><a class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/how-do-you-plan-a-social-media-campaign\"><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper--left\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\" fill=\"none\" class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon--left\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M6.345 12.743a1 1 0 001.31 1.511l5.477-4.749a1 1 0 000-1.511l-5.477-4.75a1.001 1.001 0 00-1.31 1.512l4.606 3.993-4.606 3.994z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-text bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link--desktop\">How Do You Plan a Social Media Campaign<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-container\"><p class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-title\">Next Article<\/p><a class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/career-guides\/what-skills-do-you-need-to-be-a-social-media-specialist\"><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-text\">What Skills Do You Need to Be a Social Media Specialist?<\/span><span class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon-wrapper--right\"><svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" width=\"18\" height=\"18\" fill=\"none\" class=\"bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon bstn-blocks-content-nav-footer__link-icon--right\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M6.345 12.743a1 1 0 001.31 1.511l5.477-4.749a1 1 0 000-1.511l-5.477-4.75a1.001 1.001 0 00-1.31 1.512l4.606 3.993-4.606 3.994z\"><\/path><\/svg><\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"featured_media":125379,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide\/125289"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/types\/career-guide"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide\/125289\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":125626,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/career-guide\/125289\/revisions\/125626"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/media\/125379"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=125289"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=125289"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=125289"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
