Ontario\u2019s Premier said that many citizens may struggle to keep up with an expanding city, especially in a tech hub like Toronto. Wynne confessed that government cannot be the only solution and that partnerships with a company like Sidewalk Labs are key to creating a fairer city that can harness the talents of its inhabitants.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNobody involved in this project wants to just build a new tech park, we have set our sights higher than that,\u201d said Wynne. \u201cOur goal is to build a complete urban community, where there are good opportunities for everyone to work hard and get ahead, and a place where innovation of all kinds can flourish.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Toronto Mayor John Tory took to the podium next and shouted out Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff, saying the exec is as much of a \u201ccity guy\u201d as he is a \u201ctech guy,\u201d citing Doctoroff\u2019s work in New York City.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk of people being anxious, but I look and see decision after decision, investment and investment, startup after startup,\u201d said Tory. \u201cI look to Sidewalk Labs and I see this as a time of huge opportunity for Toronto and Canada as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Tory described a yearlong period of consultation that the city will enter with Sidewalk Labs, saying they know the city will grow, but it is important to detail exactly how the city will grow. This consultation will not just be city-wide, but worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>A community town hall will be held on November 1, where the first steps towards Quayside&#8217;s development will be discussed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the culmination of almost 10 years of thinking about how tech can improve people&#8217;s lives,\u201d added Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet.<\/p>\n<p>Schmidt went on to say that Sidewalk Labs&#8217; job will be to create a platform and the neccesary infrastructure, and the company will welcome outside help and different kinds of i<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nitiatives from other companies or organizations.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The entire project will take a few years to unfold, as the first year will be all about consultation then Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs must work together beyond that to iron out an exact plan of action.
