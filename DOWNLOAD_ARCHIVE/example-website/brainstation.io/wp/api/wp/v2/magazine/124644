Rapid COVID testing and temperature screening are some of the existing options, but there is a massive opportunity to bring a digital edge to health screening.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn a post-Covid environment, you\u2019re going to see screening and public safety significantly shift,\u201d CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/17\/clear-poised-to-lead-biometric-screening-race-for-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told CNBC<\/a>. \u201cBut this time it\u2019s beyond airports \u2014 it\u2019s sports stadiums, it\u2019s retail, it\u2019s office buildings, it\u2019s restaurants.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CLEAR, a biosecurity company headquartered just off Park Avenue in Midtown Center, is helping passengers move swiftly and safely through airport security. The company recently launched a vaccine passport called Health Pass that will help restore travel to its pre-pandemic norms, empowering people to feel safe when they board a plane or attend a massive football game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Making public experiences safer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially launched as an airport security system that verifies a user\u2019s identity through biometrics such as fingerprints, CLEAR\u2019s<a href=\"https:\/\/www.biometricupdate.com\/202106\/clear-plans-100m-ipo-sees-biometric-platform-growth-potential-in-healthcare\"> service offerings<\/a> have expanded to include airport screenings, streamlined entrance to stadiums, healthcare options such as patient check-in and digital records management, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has onboarded the biometrics of 5.6 million people for access to 38 airport locations in addition to 26 sports and entertainment venues, reaching a total of 61 million total interactions of its platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CLEAR Health Pass\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7FouQAgpGiQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><figcaption>A look at CLEAR&#8217;s health pass in action<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearme.com\/\">how it works<\/a>: by downloading the CLEAR Pass app for free, US and Canadian users can take a selfie and upload their passport information. When they are ready to travel, they simply upload their trip information and can submit any customs forms directly from their phone. They can then use the airport\u2019s designated Mobile Passport Control line, where they\u2019ll show a QR code and passport to enter the US.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For streamlined mobile vaccine validation, users can upload their vaccination information to the Health Pass section of their CLEAR Pass app. The Health Pass feature also validates COVID-19 lab test results and provides health screening survey questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for a solution like CLEAR was evident: Due to lockdown restrictions and discomfort with international travel, in 2020, the number of U.S. domestic airline passengers plunged 60% and total bookings dropped 11%. People clearly felt unsafe while traveling and were looking for a way to verify the health of themselves and others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"688\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Clear-Screenshots-BrainStation-Magazine.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-124899\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Clear-Screenshots-BrainStation-Magazine.jpg 1400w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Clear-Screenshots-BrainStation-Magazine-730x359.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Clear-Screenshots-BrainStation-Magazine-768x377.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople are accustomed to moving through an airport security check, and &#8230; many hospitality companies are saying that health screening would need to be the sort of thing that people get used to,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/17\/clear-poised-to-lead-biometric-screening-race-for-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said Dorothy Creamer<\/a>, senior research analyst for hospitality and travel digital transformation strategies at IDC<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Taking off <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, CLEAR filed to go public after a 20% growth in revenue, bringing in $230.8 million in 2020.
