Now, Shopify merchants in 14 more countries have access to the TikTok channel app within Shopify: Australia, Canada, the U.K, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Israel, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, when Shopify and TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/news.shopify.com\/dancing-to-a-new-beat-shopify-brings-commerce-to-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first announced their partnership<\/a>, Blake Chandlee, vice president for global business solutions at TikTok noted that, due to the rise of social selling, &#8220;retailers are recognizing that TikTok&#8217;s creative and highly engaged community sets it apart from other platforms.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re constantly exploring new and innovative ways to connect brands with our users, and Shopify is the perfect partner to help us grow and expand our commerce capabilities globally,&#8221; he continued. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TikTok channel allows merchants to create a TikTok For Business account, and release In-Feed shoppable video ads directly within Shopify. To do this, merchants select the product they want to advertise, and a video ad is automatically generated to drive shoppers to their Shopify stores. The TikTok integration is the latest release from Shopify Channels, which are sales and marketing channels that allow merchants to connect with their customers various mediums, including Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and Walmart. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shopify has announced a number of expansions and partnerships in recent months, as the e-comm giant worked to accommodate a spike in merchants turning to online selling due to COVID-19. These included <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/02\/10\/shopify-brings-shop-pay-to-facebook-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">integrating<\/a> Shop Pay with Facebook and Instagram, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/12\/04\/stripe-to-offer-checking-accounts-through-shopify-others\" target=\"_blank\">partnering<\/a> with Stripe to offer checking accounts to vendors and merchants.
