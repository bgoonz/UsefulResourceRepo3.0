The mattress fits into a box the size of a mini-fridge and is delivered directly to the consumer\u2019s door. Since then the company sprang to a $555 million valuation thanks to celebrity investors like Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Levine and Canadian Steve Nash.<\/p>\n<p>Casper has a lot more in common with technology companies that you might guess, representing a unique intersection of technology, design and innovation. Much like Uber, Casper identified a product segment that was underserving consumers with overpriced products and a poor customer experience. They created a competing product and leveraged technology to give consumers a simple sales channel,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/casper\" target=\"_blank\">opportunities to engage with the brand<\/a>,\u00a0and control over the customer experience end-to-end.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73407\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/10\/13100901\/Casper-Office-6.jpg\" alt=\"Casper-Office-6\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" \/> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-73408\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/10\/13100901\/Casper-Office-7.jpg\" alt=\"Casper-Office-7\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4j3uoM3WKi\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.borndigital.com\/2016\/08\/30\/marketing-the-future-of-sleep-casper-ceo-philip-krim\">Marketing the Future of Sleep with Casper CEO Philip Krim<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Marketing the Future of Sleep with Casper CEO Philip Krim&#8221; &#8212; Digital Magazine\" src=\"https:\/\/www.borndigital.com\/2016\/08\/30\/marketing-the-future-of-sleep-casper-ceo-philip-krim\/embed#?secret=4j3uoM3WKi\" data-secret=\"4j3uoM3WKi\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Showroom<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Starting in a small office in Lower Manhattan, customers were immediately intrigued and would end up knocking on the door of the office for a test-nap.
