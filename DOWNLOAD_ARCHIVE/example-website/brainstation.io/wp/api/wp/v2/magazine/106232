Carving out time to spend with loved ones and staying on top of\u00a0goals (both personal and business-related) are parts of what defines Ossip\u2019s take on culture, and culture is the most important thing to him and his business.<\/p>\n<h4>Building and Building and Building<\/h4>\n<p>You could say Ossip is an entrepreneur. Or you can look at the sheer number of businesses he has created, scaled and undergone exits with, and figure it out yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Most people would start with Ossip\u2019s company Dayforce being acquired by Ceridian in 2012 for nine figures, one of the larger non-IPO exits in Canadian tech history. Or they might go to his recent record-setting Canadian IPO. But to get a true sense of his work ethic, it takes a bit farther back of a trip than 2012.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_106235\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106235\" style=\"width: 950px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-106235 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Dc1lgtOXcAAuNPt.jpg\" alt=\"David Ossip\" width=\"950\" height=\"905\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095527\/Dc1lgtOXcAAuNPt.jpg 950w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095527\/Dc1lgtOXcAAuNPt-300x286.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095527\/Dc1lgtOXcAAuNPt-768x732.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-106235\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ossip ringing the bell at the NYSE.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Ossip graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in econometrics and decided he was going to be an accountant. It didn\u2019t go well. Ossip lasted all of 15 minutes at his first job, walking out of the orientation without ever looking back.<\/p>\n<p>He eventually found work at CIBC, but they had nowhere to put him at first. As Ossip sat at his desk, he would check out what his colleagues were working on. The guy seated next to him was working on a task that would take a few months, according to his outline. Ossip leaned over and showed him a shortcut, turning those months of work into days.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCIBC thought I was this genius,&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;I wasn\u2019t.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CIBC moved Ossip to a special project where he could find more time- and money-saving techniques. He found some, but the bank never listened, so Ossip wrote a piece of software on his own. He ended up selling that software to CIBC, which gave him enough money to fund his way through Harvard Business School.<\/p>\n<p>After obtaining his MBA, Ossip took a bit of a different route than most. After a tech-scouting trip to South Africa, Ossip\u00a0founded Business Machine Interfaces and worked with clients like Toyota and Siemens. It was acquired by the Japan-based Amano in 1997, and Ossip worked with them for a year before leaving.<\/p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t done yet. After a year spent waiting out a non-compete clause, Ossip founded Workbrain in 1999 and helped it grow to over $100 million in four and a half years, It went public in 2003, then was acquired by Infor Global Solutions in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re keeping count at home, that\u2019s three acquisitions so far. After another period of a non-compete clause\u2014which seems to be the only real thing that can slow him down\u2014Ossip started Dayforce, which merged into Ceridian in 2012. From there, Ossip took over as CEO, an unorthodox move considering Dayforce was the one being acquired. But that\u00a0decision has gone pretty well since then, considering Ceridian undertook the largest tech IPO in Canadian history earlier this year, raising $610 million USD.<\/p>\n<p>All of that success\u2014four sold companies, two IPOs, and a place in Canadian tech history\u2014came down to finding the right opportunity and taking advantage of it quickly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt took me a very long time to understand that it\u2019s not about doing the hardest thing or being the brightest company on the block,\u201d Ossip says. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding a large homogenous market and a large opportunity. If you solve that elegantly and simply, you can build a company of scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Then, once a company can scale successfully, the most important aspect of maintaining a prosperous business becomes culture. Ossip has spent a lot of time thinking about culture\u2014and no, it does not only involve ping pong and free beer on Fridays.<\/p>\n<h4>Find Your Purpose<\/h4>\n<p>Culture comes in many shapes and sizes, and each company does it a different way. It\u2019s one of those things that is incredibly hard to do right, while also being incredibly easy to mess up.\u00a0Ossip is focused on doing real work that employees can be proud of, and that starts with making sure that\u00a0Ceridian&#8217;s work is innovative at its core.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn 2012 when I looked at Ceridian, it was a culture of survival,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can&#8217;t build a business on that, so we needed to switch to a culture of innovation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Some of Ossip&#8217;s foundation of good culture came from Harvard Business School. There, he says, students would be split into sections and trained to work hard everyday. After working, that section would organize fun events and bond together, then get back to work the next day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGood culture to me is where people aren&#8217;t working 50 to 60 hours a week, but instead when they are working they are completely invested and focused on the outcome of what they do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u00a0overall goal might change as\u00a0both the person and the company progresses, and that again is a sign of what Ossip considers impeccable work culture. Staying in tune with what workers want, not just now, but for the future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople transition over time, and as you learn more in a company, you become more familiar with what is out there and you change as well,\u201d says Ossip. \u201cYou need to know that what people like today is not what they might like tomorrow, so a good manager will tap into that and learn how they grow and why they want to grow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-106236\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DXN7SnrW4AAJXzU.jpg\" alt=\"david ossip\" width=\"971\" height=\"1021\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095525\/DXN7SnrW4AAJXzU.jpg 971w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095525\/DXN7SnrW4AAJXzU-285x300.jpg 285w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095525\/DXN7SnrW4AAJXzU-768x808.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That idea of Ceridian connecting with staff manifests itself in different ways. Take this for example. The company recently put in an unlimited paid time off policy\u2014which sounds great at first, until some Ceridian veterans pointed out that they were banking days off to use for early retirement. Those workers\u2014among some of Ceridian\u2019s most-valued\u2014approached\u00a0executives and found a plan that worked for them as well as new hires. There were no closed-door meetings or ignored opinions, and no one felt scared to address the problems of what on the surface seemed like an amazing perk.<\/p>\n<p>But perks and open doors are useless without purpose. That\u2019s where the guiding principle for Ossip and his company\u2019s culture comes from.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you bring people together in a way where they actually bond with each other and the company? It&#8217;s important because, with that, you have purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a bigger part of that is coming up with a purpose for your company, so it has value to your organization. Around that, you have values.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Determining company values might seem easy if you&#8217;ve read a hundred or so <em>About Us<\/em> pages from various startups, but it\u2019s taken Ossip years to craft his vision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs agile people, we are prepared to overcome new challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cThat&#8217;s part of our culture\u2014that you have to be receptive to change and you need to be nimble in a market. Diligence is again part of that culture. It ties into values like optimism, so when we define optimism it begins with careful preparation, which is diligence. That leads to knowledge, which leads to confidence, and that confidence creates success, and success is reason for optimism. So it all comes back around.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Best Foot Forward<\/h4>\n<p>With Ceridian hot off the heels of Canada\u2019s largest technology IPO in history, that optimism is contagious. Ossip addresses the milestone humbly, saying it simply gives the company freedom in how they want to grow.\u00a0When someone asked him \u201cWhat does tomorrow look like?\u201d after the bell rang at the stock exchange and the company netted $610 million, Ossip replied, \u201cI\u2019ll be back at the office.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That kind of attitude mixed\u00a0with the success of his current and past endeavours has made Ossip a big name in the Canadian tech world\u2014but don\u2019t tell that to him, as he\u2019ll never see himself as a legend in the scene. Still, he\u2019ll take the time to have coffee or hop on a phone call with anyone who wants to chat, because his experience has given him a unique view of the sector, and one that might butt heads with recent \u201cCanada\u2019s having a moment\u201d headlines.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_106234\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106234\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-106234 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/DcWywf_VMAAM6-c-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"david ossip\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095527\/DcWywf_VMAAM6-c.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095527\/DcWywf_VMAAM6-c-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/07\/13095527\/DcWywf_VMAAM6-c-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-106234\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ossip celebrating at the TSX when Ceridian went public.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>\u201cThe Canadian tech scene, well there&#8217;s good and bad,\u201d says Ossip. \u201cWe have moved forward, but when I look at other countries, some have moved even quicker. It&#8217;s like we\u2019re in a bike lane, but others are in the express lane. There&#8217;s a lot to do from the infrastructure perspective to compete with other countries, and I don&#8217;t think we\u2019re there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Scaling instead of selling is not the industry\u2019s biggest problem according to Ossip\u2014even though some experts in the scene have said the \u201cbuild to sell\u201d mentality hurts the country\u2019s ability to build an international presence.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEntrepreneurship is a profession. It\u2019s not a one-pony race,\u201d says Ossip. \u201cI think for young entrepreneurs, building something and exiting then restarting is part of a natural evolution, and not just in Canada.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe challenge isn&#8217;t with entrepreneurs. The challenge here in Canada is that we don&#8217;t have the same access to capital, and the way it moves here and its network is very different compared to the U.S. We have to solve that. The investment community here has a bigger bias on value investments. You can grow, but you can&#8217;t grow as quickly as competitors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ossip\u00a0dubs this the \u201canti-rich\u201d regime and notes that a lot of his peers have left the country to pursue better access to capital in other parts of the world. His method of fixing it is two-fold: educate investors and entrepreneurs; and build more successful tech companies\u00a0based on knowledge from those who have experience scaling organizations.<\/p>\n<p>Both of those steps are not easy to initiate, let alone follow-through with. But take advice from Ossip, at least for that second step: scaling a company is all about purpose, which breeds culture which then breeds innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Or don\u2019t listen to Ossip\u2014he\u2019s only scaled four companies, experienced two IPOs, and spearheaded two nine-figure business transactions.
