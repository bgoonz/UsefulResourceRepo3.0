After reflecting on what people really need this past year, the popular rideshare app is focused on helping users go where they want and get what they need more quickly and conveniently.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After pivoting away from newer endeavors like its air taxi and self-driving options, Uber is now offering a number of new options like vaccine booking and car rental services, as well as expanding its delivery services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOver the last year, the company has evolved into a platform where we\u2019re doing two things with incredible focus and incredible intensity,\u201d said Uber CPO Sundeep Jain. \u201cAnd those are helping users \u2018go\u2019 and helping users \u2018get.\u2019 We really have evolved this platform where you can go anywhere, get anything.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Uber\u2019s \u201cGo\u201d services, users can book a vaccine appointment and a ride to get there, all within the app. Earlier this year, Uber <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/02\/09\/uber-walgreens-partner-for-free-rides-to-vaccination-sites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnered<\/a> with Walgreens to offer free or discounted rides to vaccine appointments for marginalized groups. And just last week, Uber Canada announced a partnership with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newswire.ca\/news-releases\/the-government-of-canada-and-uber-canada-partner-to-increase-covid-19-vaccine-confidence-across-the-country-862552723.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada<\/a> to share in-app information and resources about vaccinations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber users can also now rent a vehicle using Uber Rent, book a ride in advance using Uber Reserve, and can book a driver by the hour to make running errands easier with a single driver and unlimited stops.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the \u201cGet\u201d services, riders can use Pickup and Go to grab food or stop in a store on the way to their destination. The rideshare-turned-delivery app has enhanced its delivery options, allowing for more flexible checkouts, the addition of additional merchants per order, and has expanded to over 20 cities worldwide.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also get reminders for to-do list items, save money with coupons and deals, and sign up for an Eats Pass membership to save even more and earn more perks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more people staying at home this past year, the need for delivery services has boomed (though active users still <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/4\/28\/22406197\/uber-vaccine-appointment-schedule-app\" target=\"_blank\">declined<\/a> 16%), while the new \u201cgo\u201d services are in preparation for a return to normalcy in the coming months.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last fall, Uber also launched <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/26\/uber-directs-retail-delivery-service-launches-in-canada\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber Direct<\/a>, which allows retail businesses to use Uber as its same-day delivery provider.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know\u00a0 Uber has unveiled its new strategy and suite of services, called \u201cgo anywhere, get anything.\u201d\u00a0 The program offers new and flexible options for users to travel across town or out of town and to have food and retail items delivered.
