Figure saw mortgage lending increase by almost 50% month over month in the fourth quarter of last year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis facility with J.P. Morgan will help us continue to innovate in the lending space,\u201d Mike Cagney, CEO and co-founder of Figure, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope to build on our 2020 momentum, both in volume and in bringing blockchain into the mortgage market.\u201d<br><br>Figure, which was founded in 2018, has received nearly $1.5 billion in financing to date. The fintech currently has more than 20,000 members, for which it has unlocked more than $1 billion in equity using its Provenance blockchain. In addition to mortgage refinancing and home equity loans, Figure offers personal loans and asset management services to individuals, and cap table management and capital raising tools, among other services, for institutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure&#8217;s quick rise and rapid expansion will continue beyond the JP Morgan investment, as the company is also preparing to launch a blockchain-based payments tool, Figure Pay, which uses QR codes at checkout points. In November, Cagney <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pymnts.com\/financial-inclusion-3\/2020\/figure-ceo-figure-pay-national-bank-charter-will-boost-financial-inclusion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">described<\/a> Figure Pay as &#8220;a blockchain rail and a digital wallet&#8221; that the company thinks is more cost-efficient than traditional payments processors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of Figure Pay has prompted Figure to investigate a national banking charter, as the company looks into providing financial services to individuals that Cagney refers to as &#8220;underbanked&#8221;: those who do not have sufficient traditional credit histories to qualify for loans. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is looking at things like transaction history and geolocation, and other factors that will give us some confidence to underwrite credit into that demographic and help them build a history,\u201d Cagney said in November of last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JP Morgan <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/10\/27\/jpmorgan-creates-blockchain-unit-launches-jpm-coin\" target=\"_blank\">launched<\/a> its own cryptocurrency, JPM Coin, in October of last year.
