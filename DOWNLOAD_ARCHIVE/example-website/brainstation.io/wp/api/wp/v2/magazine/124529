The new SOC will consist of round-the-clock surveillance by cybersecurity analysts, in order to detect and respond to threats across endpoints, networks, and the cloud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaseya&#8217;s expansion will be physical, in addition to infrastructural: the company&#8217;s current Miami location will increase in size by 20,000 square feet, and the company is in the process of signing another at least 50,000 square feet of office space in a nearby building. Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said the company is investing &#8220;north of a couple million bucks&#8221; on the expansion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Kaseya plans to triple its workforce in Miami by the end of 2022: the company currently has approximately 250 employees in the Florida city, and hopes to add another 500 employees there over the next 19 months. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hiring blitz will include onboarding at least 50 new associate or graduate hires by the end of June 2021, for positions in technical support and account management. Voccola said the company plans to hire between 25 to 30 cybersecurity engineers, senior architects, analysts, and technicians every year for the foreseeable future, to accommodate the company&#8217;s need for round-the-clock security monitoring. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re getting ready for about 750 to 1,000 more people here in the next three years,&#8221; Voccola said <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.refreshmiami.com\/kaseya-plans-to-triple-miami-workforce-open-new-cybersecurity-operations-center-in-miami\/\" target=\"_blank\">in an interview with Refresh Miami<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe saw the potential in Miami 17 years ago when we decided to open one of our first offices downtown,\u201d Voccola said in the press release announcing Kaseya&#8217;s expansion. \u201cWe\u2019ve found unbelievable talent in South Florida and this aggressive hiring spree reaffirms our commitment to the community and our belief in Miami as a renowned tech epicenter.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaseya, which was founded in 2000, provides security and IT management tools to small- and medium-sized businesses.
