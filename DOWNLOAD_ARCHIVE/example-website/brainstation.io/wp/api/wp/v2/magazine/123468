Peloton would be able to leverage this technology for its bikes and treadmills, which provide on-demand workouts via a built-in tablet device. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Otari, meanwhile, Peloton will acquire the designs for that company&#8217;s Otari Mat, which shut down after a successful crowdfunding campaign in December of last year. The Otari Mat was designed to have an HD screen placed on a yoga mat, with a detachable arm extending from the monitor that held an AI-enabled camera to analyze form and capture workout activity. Peloton has not indicated whether it plans to manufacture or sell the Otari Mat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Atlas Wearables, which Peloton acquired in 2020, produces a wearable smart device called the Multi Trainer. The device, which is worn like a watch, logs workout data, such as distance run and reps performed, as well as performance information such as muscle fatigue and and &#8220;psychological readiness.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Bloomberg, the engineers joining Peloton from Atlas Wearables and Otari say on their LinkedIn profiles that they are focusing on AI and computer-vision technology. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent interview, Peloton CEO John Foley said the company will be releasing a number of new products in the coming months, citing a rowing machine and a strength training device as \u201cgood guesses\u201d as to what the company is developing. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisitions are just the latest in a series of purchases from Peloton, as the brand seeks to expand its capacities as a hardware and software developer. The company paid $78.1 million for three companies during the final quarter of 2020, which did not include Aiqudo, but did include the acquisition of intellectual property from Peerfit, a digital health company. In December, Peloton also reported plans to buy Precor, a fitness equipment provider, for $420 million; and, in 2019, the company purchased Gossamer Engineering, a Silicon Valley firm that has helped design devices for Google and Facebook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peloton&#8217;s acquisitions come on the heels of a hugely successful year for the company, which saw Fitness Subscriptions\u2014which are subscriptions accessed via Peloton\u2019s devices\u2014<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/09\/peloton-grows-subscriptions-137-hits-1-33-million-users\" target=\"_blank\">increase by 137%<\/a>, hitting 1.33 million users. The company also outperformed financial expectations with its fiscal Q1 2021 earnings, hitting $757.9 million in revenue over the period, marking a year-over-year increase of 232%. In May, the company hosted its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/05\/07\/peloton-hosts-its-largest-online-class-ever-as-sales-surge-66\" target=\"_blank\">largest-ever online class<\/a>. Amid its successes, Peloton also struggled to meet demand for its Bike+ device, and as a result underperformed on fulfillment and delivery goals. CEO John Foley chalked these delays up to the unexpected rise in demand during the spike in COVID-19 cases in 2020. Peloton recently made substantial investments in its supply chain to increase production capacity, in order to reduce wait times for its equipment. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know The fitness brand recently added voice AI company Aiqudo to its portfolio, after acquiring Atlas Wearables&nbsp;and Otari, an interactive workout mat producer, last year.
