In 2019, CVS rolled out CarePass, which offers benefits such as free same-day prescription delivery and a 24-hour helpline, for $48 a year. Combined, these two programs offer not only delivery and support benefits, but also exclusive sales and promotions based on a customer&#8217;s past browsing and purchasing habits \u2014\u00a0a tool that CVS says has been key to ExtraCare&#8217;s success. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really one of the best parts of being an ExtraCare member,&#8221; Michele Driscoll, vice-president of customer engagement, loyalty, personalization and promotions of CVS Health, said in a statement. &#8220;It\u2019s important to us to deliver personalized value depending on what you buy, where you live, who you are \u2013 you never know what you\u2019re going to get or when you\u2019re going to get it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CVS app has recently added a Rewards Tracker, which allows ExtraCare members to see their progress toward earned rewards from the ExtraCare, ExtraCare BeautyClub, and ExtraCare Pharmacy &amp; Health Rewards programs, in addition to the $10 monthly reward they receive if they&#8217;re subscribed to CarePass, all in one digital space. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CVS app also shows customers how much they&#8217;re saving over time \u2014\u00a0with CVS app-users saving up to six times as much as non-app users. In addition, coupons sent to users\u2019 ExtraCare cards from the app have more than\u00a0doubled in the past year, while ExtraCare texts have grown by more than 45%, as personalized, SMS advertising has been shown to foster much higher customer engagement than email. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital couponing, meanwhile, has proven to be a huge \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/nextadvisor\/in-the-news\/save-money-with-cvs-receipts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">and somewhat viral<\/a> \u2014&nbsp;success for CVS, as social media users with ExtraCare memberships have taken to their feeds to demonstrate how to combine their digital receipts, coupons, and ExtraBucks to score huge savings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CVS mobile app also hosts a weekly circular, in a digital format, and offers users the ability to scan for deals on products they love. Driscoll said that, in the future, CVS will be working on integrations with companies such as Instacart to expand the reach of their loyalty program. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CVS first <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/19\/cvs-outlines-digital-growth-plan-to-become-a-healthcare-giant\" target=\"_blank\">outlined its robust digital strategy in early 2020<\/a>, leading with a focus on AI and customer engagement.
