I can\u2019t remember the passwords, I don\u2019t want to enter in all my info every time. There are really only eight to 10 apps that we use every single day or every single week. Those apps are going to morph into what we call super apps.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PayPal has already seen success in diversifying its offerings beyond mere payments processing, primarily with its subsidiary Venmo. In January, eligible Venmo customers <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/01\/05\/venmo-debuts-cash-a-check-feature-for-stimulus-payments\" target=\"_blank\">were able to cash government stimulus checks within that app<\/a>; in February, the Venmo credit card was made available to all users. And in April, PayPal <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/04\/20\/venmo-users-can-now-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\">introduced cryptocurrency<\/a> buying, selling, and holding capacities to Venmo. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PayPal has also extended its reach into bricks-and-mortar stores, particularly through a partnership with CVS that allows customers to pay for goods in-store through PayPal or Venmo, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/16\/cvs-launches-qr-code-payments-with-paypal-venmo\">by scanning a contactless QR code<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is in a strong position to act on its super-app goals, after an increase in e-comm, combined with the need for increased flexibility with online payments and digital funds-transfers brought on by COVID-19, led to significant growth for PayPal, which is now valued at $300 billion. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company added 73 million new active user accounts in 2020, hitting 377 million accounts, and posted <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/03\/paypals-historic-q3-cements-its-spot-atop-the-fintech-mountain\">two record-breaking quarters<\/a>. Schulman anticipates PayPal will add another 55 million new users in 2021 but says that more growth is needed before the company&#8217;s ambitions beyond payments processing will be sustainable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This needs massive scale,\u201d Schulman said. \u201cHalf a billion to one billion people, at a minimum. One billion people would be ideal.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know The popular fintech plans to introduce high-yield savings accounts, check-cashing services and stock-investing capabilities later this year.
