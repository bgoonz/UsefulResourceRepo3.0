Ford Power-Up software updates will change that by quickly bringing it to millions of people,\u201d says Alex Purdy, director of business operations and enterprise connectivity at Ford. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in more seamless technology so updates can happen while you\u2019re sleeping \u2014 making your next ride a better experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of voice assistant Alexa, \u201cdrivers will be able to use voice control to start or stop their engine, lock or unlock doors, defrost their windows, make a call or play music.\u201d Plus, if the driver already uses an Alexa smart home device, they can connect the two devices.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new software update system will also allow Ford to collect data and make improvements based on customer needs and preferences. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe can double down on the features people love, get rid of the ones people don\u2019t,\u201d Purdy said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The popular carmaker will work with Amazon \u201cto deliver enhanced features and new services over the next six years, including exploring the development of the first custom Alexa skills for Ford commercial vehicles, using Alexa artificial intelligence to help business owners and fleet managers stay in touch with their teams in the field.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with Amazon to bring powerful new AI-enabled experiences to Ford customers,\u201d says Purdy. \u201cWe believe in the power of teaming up with other innovators. Bringing Ford\u2019s vehicle know-how together with Amazon\u2019s technology expertise will deliver in-vehicle capabilities that help our retail customers travel more enjoyably and with ease, while helping our commercial customers operate more profitably.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford plans to manufacture 33 million vehicles equipped with this service and Alexa by 2028. Customers will also get complimentary access to Alexa for three years.\u00a0<br><br>Interestingly, Ford also recently signed a six-year deal earlier this year with <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/02\/02\/ford-signs-six-year-digital-transformation-deal-with-google\">Google<\/a>, focusing on both in-vehicle offerings like Google Maps and in-office technology, including its cloud service Google Drive. Though Google and Amazon have become competitors (especially in the cloud computing space), it seems Ford wants to include both as pillars of their continued technology rollout. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know\u00a0 Ford and Amazon are partnering to improve the automaker\u2019s in-vehicle software ecosystem, now offering automated software updates and outfitting new vehicles with Amazon&#8217;s voice assistant, Alexa.
