UCG was founded in 2020 with the aim of building a portfolio of purpose-driven DTC brands and helping them scale up. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dustin Jones, co-founder and CEO of UCG, said in a statement that, despite being founded as a &#8220;digitally native brand&#8221;, Frank and Oak has struggled to successfully implement omnichannel capacities in the past. &#8220;NewStore will be critical to removing any remaining friction, for customers and associates, enabling us to fuel our expansion globally with an omnichannel approach,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This partnership helps UCG to accomplish a key part of our vision\u2014to provide a truly seamless omnichannel experience to our customers around the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephan Schambach, founder and CEO of NewStore, said in a statement that &#8220;Omnichannel is essential to DTC brands&#8221; like Frank and Oak. &#8220;On the NewStore platform, Frank And Oak will be able to run their stores more like a website, with e-commerce style payments, rich data collection, and deeply personalized experiences,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seamless, mobile-friendly, omnichannel shopping experiences have proved critical for retailers in recent months, as retailers look to gain a leg up in an increasingly competitive e-comm environment.
