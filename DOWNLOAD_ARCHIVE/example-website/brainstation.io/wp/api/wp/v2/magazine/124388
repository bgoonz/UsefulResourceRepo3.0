Under the new partnership with PayPal, Happy Returns&#8217; technology and platform will extend PayPal\u2019s commerce platform &#8220;beyond discovery and payments to the post-purchase experience,&#8221; according to a Happy Returns blog post announcing the acquisition. Happy Returns plans to now focus on improving its platform and expanding its footprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition by PayPal comes as a spike in online shopping, brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in widespread disruption to the returns and exchanges process for both consumers and retailers. Happy Returns currently offers 2,600 drop-off locations in 1,200 cities across the US, and collaborates with hundreds of brand partners, allowing consumers to easily return or exchange products purchased online that may not have met their expectations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PayPal and Happy Returns already have an established relationship: PayPal invested $11 million in the returns company in 2019. At the time, Happy Returns co-founder and CEO David Sobie said that the investment from PayPal &#8220;speaks to the broader challenge or mission PayPal has, to make e-commerce as easy and frictionless as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, for PayPal, the acquisition marks yet another step forward in the company&#8217;s expansion beyond mere payments processing and into all facets of e-commerce. The company also operates Honey, the digital couponing service, as well as a discovery vertical (Offers &amp; Deals) and Venmo, the money-sending and payments processing app. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company also recently announced its plans to expand into some banking services, with high-yield savings accounts, check-cashing services, and stock-investing capabilities coming later this year, part of CEO Dan Schulman&#8217;s strategy to transform PayPal into a one-stop &#8220;super app.&#8221; The company has already introduced <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/08\/31\/paypal-debuts-buy-now-pay-later-feature\" target=\"_blank\">its own buy now, pay later feature<\/a>, Pay in 4, offering financing on purchases between\u00a0$30\u00a0and $600 made within the app. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PayPal saw <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/03\/paypals-historic-q3-cements-its-spot-atop-the-fintech-mountain\" target=\"_blank\">historic growth in 2020<\/a>, as its introduction of new features and capabilities not only kept pace with a spike in e-commerce but satisfied the increased need for flexible online payments and money-sending tools brought on by COVID-19. With Venmo, the company introduced the ability to cash COVID-19 stimulus checks and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/16\/cvs-launches-qr-code-payments-with-paypal-venmo\" target=\"_blank\">launched QR code payments<\/a> in CVS stores across the U.S. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Happy Returns, the box-free, in-person merchandise return facilitator, has been acquired by PayPal.
