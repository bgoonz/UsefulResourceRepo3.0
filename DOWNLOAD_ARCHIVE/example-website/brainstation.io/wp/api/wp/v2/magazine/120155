After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect programming, RBC launched <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rbc.com\/newsroom\/news\/2020\/20200428-future-launch-at-home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Future Launch at Home<\/a>, an online version of the program that provides virtual programming and learning opportunities for youth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRBC Future Launch at Home is all about delivering virtual programs designed to keep young people engaged while providing valuable content to empower them for the future of work,\u201d says Gary Edgar, director of social media at RBC. \u201cTeaming up with Snapchat to host this campaign allows us to reach the key youth demographic in a way that will resonate and provide access to free advice, tools and resources available through RBC Future Launch in an increasingly virtual world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the virtual program, RBC has collaborated with Snapchat to produce four short videos, which will support and engage youth in finding employment during such uncertain times. The four videos will run as ads on the popular social messaging app and, according to a press release, include topics such as how to gain new skills, enhancing your mental well-being, how to get work experience, and how to grow your network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each episode will also feature a Snapchat Augmented Reality Lens that will offer a fun and engaging way to experience RBC Future Launch content.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snapchat reaches 9 million Canadian users, of which 80% are 13 to 24 years old. Of Snapchat\u2019s 249 million total daily users, over 180 million use augmented reality every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March of this year, RBC launched a new <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/03\/03\/rbc-launches-new-technology-and-innovation-banking-group\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">technology and innovation banking sector<\/a> to deliver solutions for Canada\u2019s rapidly growing technology sector.
