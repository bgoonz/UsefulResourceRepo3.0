Meanwhile, the needs of consumer banking customers changed drastically, as the financial insecurities wrought by COVID-19 altered personal budgeting and financial goals for many around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes implemented by banks around the world were swift, responsive, and efficient, designed to accommodate not only a present in which digital finance has suddenly become the norm but a future in which this will most likely remain the case. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>JPMorgan Targets POS Market with QuickAccept Card Reader<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094855\/1280x960_QA-1024x768-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-120479\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094855\/1280x960_QA-1024x768-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094855\/1280x960_QA-1024x768-1-730x548.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094855\/1280x960_QA-1024x768-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094855\/1280x960_QA-1024x768-1-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>JPMorgan Chase launched a smartphone card reader and app, in direct competition with payment facilitators such as Square and PayPal.<\/li><li>QuickAccept lets merchants accept card payments either through a mobile app or a contactless card reader.<\/li><li>The service is free; competitors such as Square typically charge a 1.5% fee.<\/li><li>JPMorgan will soon migrate many of its more than three million small business customers to QuickAccept.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, JPMorgan Chase <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/10\/21\/jpmorgan-targets-pos-market-with-quickaccept-card-reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched<\/a>&nbsp;a new product, QuickAccept, which allows businesses to accept payments using a card reader or mobile app. The launch of QuickAccept came from JPMorgan\u2019s business branch, Chase for Business, and was part of the launch of Business Complete Banking, a new chequing account for small businesses. The service, which is free, is a direct competitor to existing services such as Square, Clover, and PayPal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch, JPMorgan said, was part of the bank&#8217;s efforts to support small businesses during a period of unprecedented challenge. \u201cEspecially in the challenging times we\u2019ve seen in 2020, helping small business clients make every sale has been our priority,\u201d Max Neukirchen, CEO of JPMorgan\u2019s merchant services arm, said in a statement. Neukirchen also noted that QuickAccept&#8217;s lack of a fee was a great differentiator when comparing the product to offerings from competitors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>JPMorgan to Launch U.K.-Based Digital Bank in Early 2021<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>JPMorgan will launch its Chase-branded entry into the U.K. consumer banking space in the first quarter of next year.<\/li><li>The finance giant has already partnered with suppliers including Amazon Web Services and 10x Future Technologies for digital infrastructure.<\/li><li>JP Morgan already operates as a digital consumer bank in the U.S., where it has 50 million customers.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/08\/24\/jpmorgan-to-launch-u-k-based-digital-bank-in-early-2021\" target=\"_blank\">announced plans<\/a> to expand its online offerings in the U.K., revealing that it would launch its entry into the U.K. consumer banking space in early 2021.

Eric Lane, global co-head of the consumer and investment management division, told investors in January that Goldman Sachs aspires &#8220;to be the leading digital consumer bank.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Goldman Sachs Seeks to Replicate Apple Card with BaaS Offering<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Goldman publicly released APIs that allow developers to integrate the bank\u2019s services into their own products, with the Goldman-operated Apple Card acting as a prime example.<\/li><li>Clients will able to easily open Goldman accounts and access the bank\u2019s automated payments system.<\/li><li>The strategy, called banking-as-a-service (BaaS), is part of Goldman Sachs\u2019 push into corporate and consumer banking.<\/li><li>Goldman first unveiled its BaaS plans at an investor day earlier this year.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman has&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/10\/28\/goldman-sachs-seeks-to-replicate-apple-card-with-baas-offering\" target=\"_blank\">made a bid<\/a>&nbsp;to enter the hugely lucrative world of corporate cash-management, announcing that it will release banking services software to clients that allow businesses to integrate Goldman\u2019s services into their own products. Goldman will publicly release its APIs to developers, who can then build Goldman\u2019s automated payments system into their own products. The move will allow Goldman to begin managing cash for corporations, an industry worth $32 billion a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banking-as-a-service (BaaS) was among the leading trends in finance in 2020, and for Goldman, could also help the bank accelerate its move into corporate and consumer transaction banking. Plus, in entering the banking-as-a-service market, Goldman positioned itself as a strong competitor to companies such as Green Dot and BBVA\u2014fintechs and digital banks that, unlike Goldman, lack a banking license.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wells Fargo Emphasizes Digital With Organizational Restructure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Wells Fargo announced a new organizational restructuring, including five new line-of-business CEOs.<\/li><li>The bank also launched an entire department focused on digital innovation.<\/li><li>Wells Fargo\u2019s EVP &amp; head of innovation sees AI as a central focus for banking innovation moving forward.<\/li><li>As of February, 43% of Wells Fargo\u2019s customer base used online banking.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February, Wells Fargo, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/13\/wells-fargo-emphasizes-digital-with-organizational-restructure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveiled<\/a> a&nbsp;new organizational structure and digital strategy, starting with a whole new department focused on digital innovation.&nbsp;Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf explained that the new model will have five line-of-business CEOs in Consumer and Small Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, Wealth &amp; Investment Management, and Consumer Lending.&nbsp;Plus, the financial institution launched a new Strategy, Digital Platform &amp; Innovation group, designed to enhance \u201cthe company\u2019s focus on planning for the digital future and investing in the customer experience.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move to direct an entire department to digital innovation signalled a new long-term strategy for Wells Fargo to incorporate digital-first thinking into every department\u2019s priorities\u2014a strategy that proved prescient as 2020 unfolded.&nbsp;The bank, however, is no stranger to online banking: as of February 2020, 43% of Wells Fargo&#8217;s total customer base already used online banking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Citi Embraces Robo-Advising With New Citi Wealth Builder<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Citi launched Citi&nbsp;Wealth Builder<em>,&nbsp;<\/em>a new low-cost digital investing platform.<\/li><li>The app was developed in partnership with Jemstep, a fintech firm that specializes in robo-advisor products<\/li><li>With over 200 million customer accounts, Citi joined a number of other banks and apps offering automated investing services.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citi <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/03\/citi-embraces-robo-advising-with-new-citi-wealth-builder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">launched<\/a> a&nbsp;new digital investing platform&nbsp;with an initial investment of just $1,500.&nbsp;Citi Wealth Builder is an easy-to-use, low-cost investing platform that works with new and existing clients to start investing and meet their retirement goals.&nbsp;With no advisory fees and an initial investment of just $1,500, customers can start investing in a matter of minutes. The new app matches customers to one of six portfolios based on their responses to finance-related questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool followed Goldman&#8217;s Marcus onto the market, and mirrors the function of similar, more well-established digital investment platforms such as Wealthsimple.
