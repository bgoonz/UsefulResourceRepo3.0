The campaign is seeking to garner new financial support to help bring sight to some of the 50 million people who suffer from vision loss while increasing awareness of the potential for their technology.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow that eSight exists, an overwhelming majority of the legally blind community has the chance to actually see. They can work for a living, proudly pay taxes, study to their fullest potential in the classroom, and they can perform and experience nearly every activity of daily life as their sighted peers do,\u201d said Jeffrey Fenton, eSight\u2019s director of outreach and communications.<\/p>\n<p>While eSight\u2019s breakthrough technology can renew independence for the legally blind, the company\u2019s headset costs nearly $10,000 USD. The high price tag can seem unobtainable when considering that 30 per cent of people who are legally blind live in poverty and seven out of 10 are unemployed, eSight reports. While the company\u00a0already helps connect potential buyers with grants and funding, eSight&#8217;s new\u00a0mission is far more ambitious.<\/p>\n<p>For those that have been able to access the technology, it has been a game changer. Scott Reese, a legally blind customer service professional, uses eSight every day.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWords cannot express how much this technology has changed my career. I can get around my office with complete independence, see the detailed expressions on my coworkers\u2019 faces, and use any computer, software and smartphone with ease,\u201d said Reese in a statement. \u201ceSight does so much more than just improve my vision; it gives me incredible mobility in my job, and helps me be a more productive and satisfied employee.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Through third-party support, eSight is calling on organizations, schools, medical professionals, community organizations, media, public officials and others to provide the company\u2019s sight-restoring technology to those that need it most. The company is also facilitating fundraising campaigns to help individuals get the financial backing they need to buy a pair of eSight\u2019s electronic glasses.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s glasses made TIME Magazine&#8217;s list of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/5023212\/best-inventions-of-2017\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25 Best Inventions<\/a>\u00a0this year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Toronto\u2019s eSight is hoping to expand access to their clinically-validated electronic glasses that let the legally blind see again in a new global campaign.
