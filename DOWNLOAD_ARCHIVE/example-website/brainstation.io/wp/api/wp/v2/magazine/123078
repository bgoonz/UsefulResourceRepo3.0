Total sales for the company hit $52.7 billion, up from $48 billion in 2019, with net earnings reaching $1.19 billion in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the digital spike is impressive, Loblaw president Sarah Davis acknowledged on an earnings call this week that the shift towards e-commerce presents &#8220;complicated&#8221; challenges for the company, including a loss of $100 million in operating income due to online sales. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe rise of digital retail has been dramatic,\u201d Davis said on the call. \u201cWe know this is where retail is headed, but it creates a challenge. Online grocery is a higher-cost channel. So we are taking steps to manage margin impact over the medium term while maintaining our leadership position.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loblaw also saw significant COVID-19-related costs in 2020: on the earnings call this week, the company cited $445 million in \u201cCOVID-19 related costs,\u201d including ramped-up safety measures, and $180 million in pay bonuses. On the earnings call, Davis noted that the massive revenue spike \u2014&nbsp;online and in-store \u2014&nbsp;is not expected to maintain throughout 2021, as vaccines roll out and customers are able to return to restaurants, adding that Loblaw, which operates the Shoppers Drug Mart chain of pharmacies, is a key player in Canada&#8217;s vaccine rollout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur supply chain can deliver vaccines the day we receive them and we can administer one million shots per week,\u201d she said, noting that some Alberta pharmacies will begin administering the COVID-19 vaccine next week, \u201cbut we have not been given the rollout strategy across all the provinces or the timing yet.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loblaw&#8217;s investments in digital infrastructure and telehealth led to spikes in e-comm sales for the grocery chain throughout 2020: in Q3, for instance, Loblaw <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/12\/loblaw-investments-in-digital-healthcare-lead-to-online-surge\" target=\"_blank\">saw its online sales spike<\/a> by 175% year-over-year.
