During the livestreamed events, viewers will be able to ask questions or add comments and can purchase products by adding them to a cart and checking out during or after the event, without navigating away from Facebook. Events will be hosted on the Shop tab within Facebook, or on participating brands&#8217; Facebook pages. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yulie Kwon Kim, who leads product for Facebook App Commerce, said that almost three-quarters of consumers are currently getting shopping ideas through Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. She says the live events \u2014\u00a0a format Facebook first trialed in 2018 \u2014 are meant not only to drive conversions but to emulate the experience of window-shopping-as-entertainment for digital consumers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Buying is not shopping,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And so, a lot of what people do is window shop to see what\u2019s new, for entertainment. You discover something cool that you didn\u2019t know about. When you\u2019re shopping, people often want to hear from a live person, get suggestions, and see the product and context. And increasingly, people are discovering and deciding what to buy through social media.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are increasingly engaging in livestreamed shopping experiences, too, as more brands adopt the format that has long been popular in Asian markets. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/12\/22\/social-commerce-brought-retail-right-to-shoppers-in-2020\" target=\"_blank\">spike in livestreamed and social shopping experiences<\/a> has been largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the rate at which retailers sought ways to engage consumers online. In recent months, brands including <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/10\/14\/levis-hilfiger-experiment-with-livestream-shopping-model\" target=\"_blank\">Levi&#8217;s<\/a>, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/05\/10\/e-l-f-cosmetics-taps-twitch-for-livestream-shopping\" target=\"_blank\">E.l.f. cosmetics<\/a> have experimented with live shopping streams, while large retailers such as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/03\/18\/nordstrom-launches-livestream-shopping-channel\" target=\"_blank\">Nordstrom<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/02\/02\/qvc-brings-livestream-shopping-to-youtube\" target=\"_blank\">QVC<\/a>, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/03\/17\/walmart-doubles-down-on-social-selling-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart<\/a> have also begun using the format. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other major tech brands, too, have recognized the rising power of live shopping events, with BNPL platform Afterpay <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/04\/06\/afterpay-launches-livestream-shopping-platform\" target=\"_blank\">launching its own livestream shopping platform<\/a> early last month.
