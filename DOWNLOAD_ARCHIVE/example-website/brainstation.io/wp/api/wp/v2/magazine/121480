The launch of checking accounts and debit cards will follow a trend of aggressive expansion into consumer banking for Goldman, traditionally an investment bank, which has also included the launch of a credit card with Apple in 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marqeta is a card-issuing platform and payments processor that launched in 2016, which currently powers companies including Instacart and Square&#8217;s Cash App, while Goldman is already an investor in the fintech. Because of this, Marqueta founder and CEO Jason Gardner says the checking account partnership is &#8220;not a transaction&#8221; and more of an extension of the two companies&#8217; existing relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s years of getting to know the team, sharing roadmaps of where we&#8217;re headed and what we&#8217;re going to do, which ultimately comes to Goldman Sachs choosing Marqeta to help them build these products,&#8221; Gardner said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July of 2020, Marqeta\u2014which, at the time, had issued more than 140 million cards\u2014was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-marqeta-ipo-exclusive\/exclusive-goldman-sachs-backed-payments-startup-marqeta-prepares-for-ipo-idUSKBN24A37L\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly preparing for an IPO<\/a>, though one has not yet been made. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs has been steadily building out Marcus&#8217; capacities, and the launch of checking capabilities has long been rumored.
