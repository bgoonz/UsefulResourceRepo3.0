New York Architect Ernest Flagg designed the facade wrought iron railings reminiscent of the iconic Singer legs and treadle. They still exist in their original glory as an homage to the turn-of-the-century entrepreneurial giant, only\u00a0now it houses a modern entrepreneurial success.<\/p>\n<p>Founded by CEO Robert Madonna, Savant opened its doors\u00a0in 2005. Originally targeting\u00a0luxury homeowners, the company quietly became the leader in premium home automation with celebrity clients like Bono and Steve Jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Savant&#8217;s systems leverages Apple hardware, echoing their simplicity and ease of use: Simply snap a picture of you room and tap on different parts of the photo to control lights, shades, temperature, security, entertainment systems and more, all from a smartphone.

The 8000 square foot\u00a0SoHo\u00a0&#8216;Experience Center&#8217; designed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thomfilicia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Thom Filicia<\/a> was built in 2010 as demo space for the company&#8217;s high rolling clientele to demonstrate the breadth and depth of Savant&#8217;s technology. While this is still the case, when Bryant Brennan, Savant&#8217;s VP of Design,\u00a0joined the company in 2014 he insisted that his creative team should also be based out of the inspiring penthouse.<\/p>\n<p>Entering the third floor, the dedicated elevator doors open to a crisp, warm and decidedly tech-heavy space complete with a flatscreen built into the coffee table.

His staff arrive at 10AM but the atmosphere is cozy enough that staying late is kind of a bonus. The all-nighters aren&#8217;t\u00a0so painful when you can pull up on a giant leather sofa with your own playlist to keep you company.\u00a0Every\u00a0room is set up with Savant &#8216;Scenes&#8217; controlled by the remote, so when the boardroom needs to transition from an interview space to a Superbowl party it is literally one tap away;\u00a0the shades to close, lights dim, volume increases and the TV switches to the right channel.<\/div>\n<div class=\"bigbox_tabletview_placeholder\">\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"bigbox_tabletview_placeholder\">As you go from one space to the next to have a space change to your wants &amp; needs and have it be personal to you is an amazing kind of space for a creative person to play in.\u00a0\u2013<em> Bryant Brennan, Savant VP of Design<\/em><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"bigbox_tabletview_placeholder\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73709 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/10\/13100855\/Savant-Office-22.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/div>\n<p class=\"bigbox_tabletview_placeholder\">Even bringing in family is easy.
