Customers will be offered bi-directional functionality between U.S. Bank&#8217;s My Controls panel and the beta Plaid Portal, allowing them to adjust their permissions quickly and easily through either company\u2019s experience. Those settings will remain synced across more than 4,500 apps on Plaid\u2019s network, which includes Venmo, Stripe, Acorns, and Expensify, among others. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we did together with Plaid is a huge step forward in open finance, especially for our shared customers,\u201d Gareth Gaston, executive VP and chief digital officer for platforms and capabilities at U.S. Bank, said in a statement. \u201cThe overall digital financial ecosystem is stronger when credentials are eliminated and replaced with secure APIs. It also helps customers have greater transparency, control and security to ultimately lead healthier financial lives.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plaid and U.S. Bank said the new integration between the two companies was done &#8220;in record time,&#8221; owing to the close partnership between them. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can accomplish when you have a shared vision for providing customers with secure, transparent and delightful digital experiences,\u201d Ginger Baker, head of financial access at Plaid, said of the speedy integration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration between Plaid and U.S. Bank comes as a number of major financial institutions are embracing open banking.
