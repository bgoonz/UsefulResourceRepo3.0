It\u2019s not your imagination. Entire industries are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to transform themselves for the digital economy.

The problem was, there were no institutions that provided hands-on digital skills training that could keep up with the evolving landscape.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Looking to fill that gap, BrainStation took its first steps with a series of digital skills workshops that were used to gauge interest.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106642\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-30-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-30\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-30-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-30-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-30.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72417\" src=\"https:\/\/borndigital.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-7.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-7\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1007\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the early stages, we were constantly running experiments,&#8221; Field explains. &#8220;The MVP approach was something that was being used in software development, but we figured we could apply it to learning. We called it &#8216;Agile Learning,&#8217; and with that, we were able to run workshops for non-technical professionals and make changes on the fly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Twenty-six people signed up for the first workshop, which was held in a coworking space on King Street West in Toronto. The fledgling company would host four more workshops in the next month.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith every learning experience, we could see this community of ambitious professionals growing, and they were looking to BrainStation for more,&#8221; says Field. &#8220;They would express what they liked, what they didn\u2019t like, and we would make changes. From seating formations and workshop topics to lectures and classwork\u2013it was all trial and error. That process set the foundations for us to become a market leader in digital skills training.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106639\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-33-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-33\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-33-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-33-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-33-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-33-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-33.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106637\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-34-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-34\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-34-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-34-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-34-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-34-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095504\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-34.jpg 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To meet increasing demand, BrainStation started working with industry experts to develop learning options that would better serve working professionals. Workshops soon gave way to part-time professional development courses, which led to full-time career transformation programs and enterprise training, all in a dedicated BrainStation learning space.<\/p>\n<p>Today, BrainStation has state-of-the-art campuses in New York, <a href=\"https:\/\/borndigital.com\/2016\/09\/19\/killer-spaces-brainstation-is-the-heartbeat-of-toronto-tech\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/borndigital.com\/2017\/10\/25\/brainstation-vancouver-opens-doors-to-new-granville-street-campus\" target=\"_blank\">Vancouver<\/a>, as well as a new <a href=\"https:\/\/borndigital.com\/2018\/05\/25\/brainstation-launches-online-live-classroom-platform\" target=\"_blank\">Online Live campus<\/a>, which together have helped empower over 50,000 professionals, and some of the largest organizations in the world.<\/p>\n<h3>Product<\/h3>\n<p>BrainStation set out to develop training options that cover the entire lifecycle of a digital product, including three full-time diploma programs (<a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/course\/toronto\/web-development-immersive\/?utm_source=techvibes&amp;utm_medium=spotlight&amp;utm_campaign=Aug3_TVSpotlightSeries\">Web Development<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/course\/toronto\/user-experience-immersive?utm_source=techvibes&amp;utm_medium=spotlight&amp;utm_campaign=Aug3_TVSpotlightSeries\">User Experience Design<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/course\/toronto\/data-science-bootcamp\/?utm_source=techvibes&amp;utm_medium=spotlight&amp;utm_campaign=Aug3_TVSpotlightSeries\">Data Science<\/a>), and a variety of part-time certification courses (across five disciplines: Data, Design, Marketing, Product, and Development), cloud platform training, and accelerated corporate learning options.<\/p>\n<p>The company realized early on, though, that you can\u2019t \u201cset and forget\u201d the curriculum for digital skills training. To be of value to working professionals, courses need to be as current as possible. To achieve that, BrainStation adopted an adaptive approach to course development, with curriculum updated on a daily basis, in real-time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re constantly benchmarking our curriculum against what\u2019s happening in the field, and then using our data to figure out what skills are most in-demand, now and tomorrow,\u201d says Field.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106646\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-26-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-26\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-26-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-26-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-26-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-26.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106663\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-9-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-9\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-9-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-9-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-9.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106658\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-14-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-14\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095501\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-14-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095501\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095501\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-14-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095501\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-14-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095501\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-14.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As BrainStation discovered, cutting-edge curriculum can only take you so far. The delivery of course material\u2013and that is to say, the learning experience\u2013is the key element, and improving that has been a driving force at the company. BrainStation, for example, only accepts the top 30 applicants for its diploma programs, which are led by a team of four educators and TAs. The small size ensures and emphasizes engagement, collaboration, and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith small class sizes and more hands-on, project-based coursework, we can replicate what professionals experience in the field, letting our students walk away with the knowledge and confidence to apply skills right away,\u201d Field said.<\/p>\n<h3>Campuses<\/h3>\n<p>BrainStation now boasts multiple campuses: a penthouse in New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood; and downtown properties in Toronto and Vancouver. All campuses share a minimalist design sensibility, as well as: a great renovation and renewal story (BrainStation Toronto was the site of the quirky Global Village Backpackers hostel); their own coffee house, Quantum Coffee (BrainStation\u2019s sister company); and a central position in each city\u2019s respective tech scene.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur campuses are designed to inspire creativity, but they\u2019re also meant to be gathering places; we have beautiful, multifunctional event spaces and lounges, and our very own coffee house. All told, between Quantum Coffee patrons and BrainStation learners, tens of thousands of individuals enter our campuses on a monthly basis,\u201d Field said.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, BrainStation has hosted hundreds of student demo days and industry events, including panel discussions, seminars, workshops, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72426\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100912\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-16.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-16\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106665\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-6-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-6\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-6-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-6-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-6.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72435\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100911\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-1-3.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-1-3\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Culture<\/h3>\n<p>BrainStation has nearly doubled its workforce in the last year, but it has maintained an unwritten policy of hiring professionals that fit the lifelong learner profile.

Our clients have extremely busy lives, and Synapse gives us the ability to offer learning experiences for any schedule and location.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Synapse also allows the company to gather key data and insights\u2014including the comprehension of course content\u2014to further refine the platform and curriculum, and create a more personalized learning experience for students.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe power and versatility of our platform really opens up the possibilities,\u201d says Field. \u201cIt\u2019s another way for us to put the client at the center of the best possible learning experience.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106671\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-3-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-3\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-3-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-3-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095459\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-3.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-102916\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/02\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/02\/13095710\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/02\/13095710\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/02\/13095710\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/02\/13095710\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/02\/13095710\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-5.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106643\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-29-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStation Vancouver Office-29\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-29-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-29-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-29-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-29-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/08\/13095503\/BrainStation-Vancouver-Office-29.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-72429\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100911\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-19.jpg\" alt=\"BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-19\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100911\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-19.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100911\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-19-730x487.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100911\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-19-1460x973.jpg 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/13100911\/BrainStationCC-V2_SMALL-19-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ever get the feeling that everything is changing?
