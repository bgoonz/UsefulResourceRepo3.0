Customers who make purchases using their Barclays debit card at H&amp;M, shoe retailer Schuh, Just Eat and Papa Johns will now be able to see itemized receipts within the Barclays app, reducing the need for paper receipts and providing a new tool that appeals to an increasingly contactless retail environment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The itemized receipt tool is opt-in, and Barclays customers will receive a prompt to set up itemized receipts within the Barclays app when they make debit purchases with participating retailers. To set up the feature, customers will log onto the Barclays app, navigate to the &#8220;Products&#8221; tab, and then select &#8220;Digital Receipts&#8221;. The itemized receipts function had previously been available as a pilot to users of the Barclays Launchpad app, which allows customers to test experimental or upcoming digital features from the bank. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new function comes just over a month after Barclay&#8217;s launched its mobile virtual card, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/12\/17\/barclays-introduces-mobile-virtual-card\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Precisionpay Go<\/a>, which will let companies issue virtual cards for their employees\u2019 online purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flux, which was founded in 2016, links itemized receipt data captured by  POS systems to mobile banking apps, and can also give merchants new data on consumer behavior. In addition to receiving a substantial cash investment from Barclays, Flux <a href=\"https:\/\/rise.barclays\/success-stories\/flux\/\">was also part<\/a> of the bank&#8217;s startup accelerator program, Rise. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Barclay&#8217;s tool is part of an overall trend that has seen banks offering more granular, detailed data within their apps. Similarly, in September 2020, Mastercard and Ethoca <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/09\/29\/mastercard-ethoca-launch-transaction-transparency-tool\" target=\"_blank\">partnered<\/a> for a tool that will display information such as company logos and more detailed merchant names within Mastercard&#8217;s app, so customers can more easily identify purchases. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Barclays customers who pay using debit will be able to access itemized receipts within the Barclays app for purchases at H&amp;M, shoe retailer Schuh, and Just Eat and Papa Johns.
