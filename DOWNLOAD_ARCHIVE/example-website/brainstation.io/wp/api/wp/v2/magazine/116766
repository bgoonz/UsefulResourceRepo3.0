The new feature is mainly aimed at convenience, but it also is an easy way for the bank&#8217;s customers to more easily control their finances. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over 1.3 million Lloyds Bank customers added new subscription services when the pandemic hit in March, but the number dropped back down after users began to assess their finances during the pandemic. Plus, many customers may have signed up for a one-month free trial and then forgotten to unsubscribe after the first month, resulting in an unwanted charge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new mobile app feature provides customers a snapshot of the subscriptions linked to their debit card and sends push notifications to keep them informed about charges and price changes. They can also now cancel their subscription within the banking app.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCustomers have been able to manage direct debits and standing orders online for some time,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lloydsbankinggroup.com\/Media\/Press-Releases\/2020-press-releases\/lloyds-bank\/lloyds-adds-new-subscription-management-service-to-mobile-banking-app\/\">said Nick Edwards, digital service director of Lloyds Bank<\/a>. \u201cWith the growing popularity of subscription services we\u2019ve launched this market leading service to respond to our customers\u2019 desire for more control and flexibility in the ways they manage their money.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith over 16 million customers online and 12 million using our mobile app, this is one in a series of new and exciting features we are launching this year to continually improve customers online experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/01\/29\/technology\/personaltech\/paying-subscription-services.html\">Americans each spent a yearly average of $640 <\/a>on digital services like music and television streaming. This number is likely to increase as we become increasingly dependent on digital and cloud-based services. The update from Lloyds makes it easier to track these subscriptions\u2014and easier to cancel them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Lloyds Bank has added a new feature to its mobile app, allowing users to manage subscription services such as streaming platforms and food box delivery.
