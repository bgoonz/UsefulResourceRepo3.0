JPMorgan now plans to return to cxLoyalty as the tech platform behind its travel program; by gaining cxLoyalty\u2019s technology, JPMorgan will own both ends of a two-sided platform, and will eventually be able to offer unique deals to credit card users who have direct relationships with hotel and airline companies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>cxLoyalty Group claims to have 3,000 clients and marketing partners serving 70 million consumers. The company currently serves major credit cards including&nbsp;Citigroup,&nbsp;Capital One,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mastercard. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition of cxLoyalty marks a strong start to the year for JPMorgan and continues on last year&#8217;s trend of strong innovation for the bank.
