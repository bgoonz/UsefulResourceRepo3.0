The company, which will host the third-party marketplace on a revamped thebay.com, is currently accepting applications for vendors via an online form and will be selling goods that fall within its current categories of apparel, home, beauty, and accessories, as well as potential new categories. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to apply for consideration, vendors are asked if they currently ship to the US and Canada, how many retailers currently carry their brand, and whether they currently sell in any other marketplaces. The Bay&#8217;s online vendor application form also asks whether an applicant&#8217;s product is BIPOC owned or designed, though answering this question is not mandatory. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hudson&#8217;s Bay had previously <a href=\"https:\/\/outline.com\/9zaqmG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced plans<\/a> to launch a third-party marketplace in November of last year. At the time, Adam Powell, senior vice-president of OMNI customer experience of Hudson\u2019s Bay, said the company was &#8220;already ahead of where we needed to be in terms of building this platform,&#8221; adding that its development &#8220;coincided with the timing of the pandemic.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bay&#8217;s third-party marketplace is slated to launch later this year. With the new business model, The Bay is competing with retail giants such as Amazon and Walmart, both of which host third-party marketplaces; Walmart&#8217;s Marketplace <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/07\/28\/walmart-marketplace-doubles-in-size-with-help-from-shopify\" target=\"_blank\">doubled in size<\/a> in 2020, thanks to a strategic partnership with Shopify, demonstrating the efficacy of the model\u2014especially now, as most commerce has been driven online due to COVID-19. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other retail chains have entered the third-party marketplace business in the past year, including IKEA, which <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/03\/13\/ikeas-third-party-marketplace-experiment-is-historic-first\" target=\"_blank\">began offering<\/a> its products on third-party sellers\u2014such as Alibaba\u2014early last year. US grocery chain Kroger <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/08\/11\/kroger-expands-third-party-marketplace-via-ship\" target=\"_blank\">launched<\/a> a third-party marketplace late last year, where it will eventually host an additional 50,000 items for Kroger, including toys, housewares, and specialty food items, all of which will be provided by Kroger\u2019s existing brand partners. And in Canada, grocery giant Loblaw <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2019\/11\/25\/loblaw-launches-new-online-marketplace\" target=\"_blank\">launched<\/a> a new online marketplace in late 2019, where it sells items from brands such as Umbra and Lennox Furniture Inc. through its PC Express click-and-collect service. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. will launch an online marketplace for third-party vendors this year.
