Scotiabank can then use that data to drive specific offers, platforms, or advice to the client through the channel they see fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith C.MEE, we&#8217;ll be able to provide customers with relevant solutions in real-time,&#8221; Scotiabank&#8217;s EVP of data and analytics Phil Thomas told Digital. &#8220;The more they interact with us, the more we can run the model. We can learn what channel they&#8217;re using, what products they interact with, and more, then push them relevant offers. It&#8217;s centered around providing customers choice.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, one of the main use cases for C.MEE is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/09\/23\/scotiabank-launches-advice-for-pandemic-financial-planning\" target=\"_blank\">Scotiabank&#8217;s Advice+ platform<\/a>. As the bank engages customers through Advice+, C.MEE can offer more detailed tidbits of information that in turn create a more robust and results-driven conversation. This works whether it&#8217;s a customer looking for advice on their own or meeting with an advisor. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019re able to pull data from multiple sources that informs the discussion,&#8221; says Thomas. &#8220;We can pull information and pop back out to the customer an offer or advice that&#8217;s appropriate for them. It underpins Advice+.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>C.MEE also works for Scotiabank customers engaging through other bank channels. Thomas outlines an example: If a client is searching through the bank&#8217;s website at 2AM looking for investment solutions or advice, C.MEE can gather that data and send a personalized offer that will be waiting for them when they wake up. Depending on if the customer prefers to use email or the app, the offer will be waiting as a push notification or sitting in their inbox. The details of that offer might be a discounted rate for initial investments or something else meant to draw the customer into Scotiabank&#8217;s investment platforms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We can also offer you a phone call,&#8221; says Thomas &#8220;Through C.MEE, we can send a notice to the customer&#8217;s financial advisor that they&#8217;re looking for a solution, and that FA can proactively call them and get a conversation going.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This notion of C.MEE bridging a digital gap is an important one, according to Thomas. Through C.MEE, Scotiabank can centralize all of a customer&#8217;s data across multiple channels and have it prepared for an advisor before they meet with a client. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s predictive and descriptive analytics, all based on customer behavior,&#8221; explains Thomas. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, Thomas describes C.MEE as a platform that supports shifting customer habits and provides a compelling experience, regardless if the customer engages digitally or in-person. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBeing able to receive intuitive value-add offers is important,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of how the consumer interacts with everything else outside banking already, you know? The way people consume products is fundamentally shifting.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas notes that, despite the pandemic driving the majority of consumer banking interactions online, the industry is still very based on face-to-face branch interactions and call centers, and that won&#8217;t go away soon. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The real sweet spot for us is to mesh knowing customer better through AI with providing customers options on how they want to interact with us. It&#8217;s a matter of leveraging these advancements to provide smarter choices. The more we know, the better we can design digital tools that make sense for every customer.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Scaling C.MEE and Scotiabank AI<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>C.MEE runs through Scotiabank&#8217;s Global AI Platform, a solution first launched at the beginning of last year but <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/23\/scotiabank-launches-global-ai-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveiled in November 2020<\/a>. The global platform unites data across several Scotiabank touchpoints into one central location that all other tools\u2014consumer-facing or otherwise\u2014can then utilize. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of this is C.MEE&#8217;s ability to scale into new markets. Although it will be live in only Canada for the first half of 2021, it will push to Scotiabank&#8217;s other markets before the year ends, including Mexico, Colombia, and Peru. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas said one of the main goals for C.MEE was to ensure it could be expanded beyond Canada and impact Scotiabank&#8217;s significant reach in the Americas. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Scotiabank has unveiled C.MEE, a new AI technology that connects a client&#8217;s data across multiple channels to offer personalized experiences and recommendations.
