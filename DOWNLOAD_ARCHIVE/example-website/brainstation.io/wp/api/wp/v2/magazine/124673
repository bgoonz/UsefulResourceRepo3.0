Then, Pipe instantly rates the performance of the business and qualifies it for a trading limit. Trading limits currently range from $50,000 for smaller early-stage and bootstrapped companies to over $100 million for late-stage and publicly traded companies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wide range means Pipe doesn\u2019t just work with startups, but any rapidly scaling company seeking additional funding. And not only does it offer instant access to capital for companies, but it also allows investors to diversify their portfolios with automated trading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe best way to summarize it is we can work with any company that has a high degree of predictability around their revenue,\u201d Hurst explained. \u201cWe\u2019re helping companies grow on their own terms. Virtually every company in the world has a recurring revenue model already, or if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re thinking about how they can shift to it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pipe has no cost for capital. Investors compete against each other for deals on its platform and in return, Pipe charges both parties a fixed trading fee of up to just 1%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re building tools on the product side and we\u2019re providing access to capital markets, and especially in the case of early-stage companies that would not otherwise have access to capital, we\u2019re trying to level the playing field,\u201d said Hurst.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pipe is primed for global expansion, already seeing traction in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada, with India to soon become one of its largest markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pipe&#8217;s own growth<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansion comes off the back of Pipe\u2019s own recent traditional funding: Pipe recently announced it has successfully raised $250 million in strategic equity funding, valuing the company at $2 billion. Just two and a half months prior, Pipe had raised $50 million from a number of high-profile investors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;By fundamentally changing the way entrepreneurs and organizations raise capital to fund their growth, Pipe has quickly emerged as one of the most important financial technology companies in the world,&#8221; said the leader of the funding round, Ashton Newhall, managing general partner, Greenspring Associates. &#8220;Our investment will further Pipe&#8217;s mission to put companies in the driver&#8217;s seat of their growth.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now over <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/19\/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">4,000 companies<\/a> using Pipe, with tens of millions of dollars currently being traded every month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/mac-venture-capital\/pipe-a-new-way-to-fund-saas-growth-5b2b50d698d6\" target=\"_blank\">11,000 SaaS companies<\/a> in the world, and worldwide public cloud revenue growing above 17% year-over-year, the possibility for Pipe\u2019s expansion is undeniable. The market opportunity will only widen as more founders look for non-traditional funding options while embracing a new digital-focused future of work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Miami and beyond<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the post-COVID work world, Pipe is also leaning into a decentralized office concept. The platform currently employs team members in New York, Portland, Seattle, California, and Europe, in addition to its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.refreshmiami.com\/following-founders-move-to-miami-pipe-opens-the-startups-first-microhub-in-wynwood\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Miami \u201cmicrohub.\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs we build up hubs of people within the company, it makes sense for us to invest into strategic locations and set up physical space for people to, at their leisure, collaborate in person once it is safe to do so,\u201d explains Hurst. \u201cIt is never going to be mandated that you need to be in the office, but what we are trying to provide for is a quiet, private collaborating space for our team members.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next micro hub will likely be in New York City, with plans for further expansion in Europe and Asia, too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Pipe COO Michal Cieplinski touts Miami\u2019s culture of innovation. \u201cKnowing that tech is so strongly supported in Miami is invigorating\u2026 It\u2019s ready for tech.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Off the back of its new funding, the company will greatly boost its employee count in the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHarry and I are really committed to building the tech ecosystem,\u201d says Cieplinski. \u201cWe\u2019re actively hiring and looking to mentor young entrepreneurs in the Miami area \u2026 We are investors too \u2013 we want to find the young talent&#8230; Miami breeds innovation in a way we weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scaling a small business comes with a wide range of challenges, but the greatest hurdle most entrepreneurs face is accessing the capital needed to fully embrace the next stages of growth.&nbsp; For service-based online startups, that difficulty is heightened as banks may be hesitant to loan to them without traditional assets for collateral.
