Members need to provide their insurance and prescriber information in order to request an expected co-pay amount, which is displayed within the Amazon Pharmacy platform. Customers can then compare their co-pay cost to the savings offered by Prime. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new tool from Amazon Pharmacy is just the latest in series of moves from Amazon aimed at strengthening the company&#8217;s foothold in the growing virtual healthcare arena. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March, the e-comm giant <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/03\/18\/amazon-expands-healthcare-platform-nationwide\" target=\"_blank\">announced plans to expand Amazon Care<\/a>, its healthcare program, nationwide. Amazon Care functions as an alternative to traditional healthcare programs, providing direct, live chats with a nurse or doctor via the Amazon Care app. If a patient requires in-person care, a medical professional is sent to their home to provide services that may include blood tests, chest exams, or delivery of prescriptions. The company also recently <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/03\/05\/amazon-integrates-alexa-into-halo-fitness-device\" target=\"_blank\">integrated Halo, Amazon\u2019s wearable fitness device, with Alexa speakers<\/a>, allowing users to ask Alexa questions about their health without having to interact with Halo\u2019s app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon is not alone in expanding its healthcare reach. Competitor Walmart is hot on the company&#8217;s trail, most recently with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/05\/07\/walmart-takes-on-amazon-with-memd-telehealth-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\">the acquisition of WeMD<\/a>, a telehealth platform that will allow Walmart to offer virtual healthcare through Walmart Health nationwide. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Amazon Prime members can now compare medication costs at Amazon Pharmacy and more than 60,000 retail pharmacies across the US.
