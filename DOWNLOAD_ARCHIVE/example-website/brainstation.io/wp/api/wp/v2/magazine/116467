But in the meantime, many retailers have done much more than just waiting out the storm. So more so that they are reinventing their online presence and launching new and innovative ways to serve their customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IKEA is a prime example. The Swedish retail giant was named the brand that has had the most success leveraging e-commerce capabilities to maintain a steady stream of revenue according to digital traffic, sales, and customer retention. Although IKEA typically only shares sales data once per year in the fall, reports suggest that IKEA\u2019s online sales have reached double what they were a year ago, and in the U.S., e-commerce sales have reportedly risen by over 60 percent in April and May <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other countries are seeing even starker increases. In Denmark, IKEA&#8217;s e-commerce sales are nearly 10 times pre-pandemic levels. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back to 2019, Ingka Group (IKEA\u2019s parent comapny) reported a <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2019\/12\/04\/ikea-boosts-digital-sales-by-50-and-preps-new-app-launch\">46 percent YoY jump in e-commerce sales<\/a>, with online accounting for 11 percent of total sales. Now, IKEA\u2019s current online sales are closing in on 25 percent of total intake, a massive chunk of the company\u2019s $45 billion-plus revenue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to reach these numbers, IKEA has undergone massive changes and pioneered what they believe should be the new normal for all of retail. IKEA\u2019s chief digital officer Barbara Martin Coppola discussed her company&#8217;s (and the industry\u2019s) overall evolution at the recent Collision 2020 conference.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is a permanent shift towards e-commerce and its convenience,\u201d says Coppola. \u201cWe are absolutely seeing a gain. There has been an incredible increase in online sales.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coppola points towards some of the obvious increases first\u2014as more consumers began to work from home, there was a massive increase in demand for home office decor and furniture. In Australia, the demand for these IKEA products jumped 400 to 500 percent. But as the initial rush died down, other products such as storage solutions and children\u2019s products increased, keeping up the torrid e-commerce pace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201c[The changes] we used to see happen in months, it would be done in days. It\u2019s quick decision-making for everything online.\u201d<\/p><cite>Barbara Martin Coppola, Chief Digital Officer, IKEA<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have actually stopped a lot of non-proactive activities and focused on this opportunity. E-commerce has been developing incredibly fast, and that demands operational excellence from us and a focus on the experience we offer consumers,\u201d says Coppola.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Four ways retail will shift at IKEA<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the surge towards online shopping, retail will eventually return to some sense of normalcy, but as the head of one of the largest e-commerce departments in the world, Coppola has an idea as to what that new standard will look and feel like.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.) Customer privacy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, IKEA wants to respect consumer privacy and make it known that they believe every other retailer should follow suit. Earlier this year, Coppola and her team <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/01\/31\/ikea-announces-new-diy-data-control-for-shoppers\">announced a set of data control measures<\/a> for IKEA shoppers that allows them to control what the retailer has access to. Consumers can toggle whether or not IKEA can see browsing history, previous purchases, preferences, saved credit card information, and even abandoned carts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe have started with an incredible ambition in regards to keeping data safe,\u201d says Coppola. \u201cWe want to continue with the trust people have in our brand. They invite us into their home, and it&#8217;s important to honor that trust. Data is personal\u2014it is part of a human being &#8230; If people don&#8217;t want us to keep credit card information, we need to delete that from our systems immediately. It\u2019s algorithms that update themselves instantly with choices consumers make.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are respecting privacy in-store, but we need to bring those values to e-commerce and online,\u201d Coppola continues. \u201cThat massively changes the e-commerce experience you offer to people. And offering that with dialogue and consent that is understandable is important.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.) Improved e-commerce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coppola\u2019s second idea around the evolution of retail builds on interactivity and IKEA\u2019s ability to inject a bit of personality into the e-commerce experience. She believes that the future of online retail at IKEA will feature the ability to inject personalized knowledge and the feeling of being in a store.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.) New digital experiences<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third aspect of IKEA\u2019s e-commerce retail future is one that highlights the brand\u2019s ability to innovate at a high level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s new experiences,\u201d says Coppola. \u201cOnline, you can do so much. Soon, we will give people the digital ability to design your home photographically in 3D in a very simple way. Take a picture, swap furniture in and out, and visualize how it fits. All of that is a part of new experiences online and it is important to continue doing that.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IKEA\u2019s new experiences do not end there. In fact, the brand is among the global leaders when it comes to rolling out new and unique ways to engage with products online. From using <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/10\/ikeas-locally-targeted-digital-showrooms-boost-sales-17\">locally-standardized living room layouts<\/a> to boost sales 17% in Russia to launching <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2019\/12\/19\/ikeas-2020-strategy-focuses-on-smart-home-automation\">integrated smart home offerings based on simple shortcuts<\/a>, IKEA is consistently pushing the envelope when it comes to combining technology and retail.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.) &#8220;Phygital&#8221; &#8211; when physical meets digital<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Coppola\u2019s final fourth point about IKEA\u2019s evolution as a retailer involves the mixing of e-commerce and physical sales\u2014\u201dphygital\u201d as she describes it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is so much innovation coming to stores to help you purchase and explore products,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few examples include a recent IKEA experiment to <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/19\/ikea-experiments-with-turning-travel-time-into-currency\">turn travel time into currency<\/a>. IKEA created a solution that permitted customers in Dubai to purchase items with the total distance they traveled to get to the store in order to incentivize those who may be discouraged based on store distance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the ongoing pandemic, these changes and more have happened at an incredible pace. Coppola points to an \u201cincreased overall digitization\u201d speed that has allowed IKEA\u2019s digital team to respond to the online influx by developing and launching solutions in an expedited manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat we used to see happen in months, it would be done in days,\u201d says Coppola. \u201cIt\u2019s quick decision making for everything online.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The next stage of fulfillment<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With increased e-commerce numbers comes an increased strain on getting those products out the door. At the onset of the pandemic in April and May, IKEA shoppers were faced with long waits for products and pickup time slots that were nearly impossible to secure. In response to the dramatic rise, Coppola says IKEA shifted many stores to become fulfillment centers themselves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor those countries that allow that, IKEA stores are an hour away\u2014max\u2014from 90% of the customers we serve. You can see how that&#8217;s an incredible advantage. We have turned those stores into fulfillment centers for now and after COVID. That&#8217;s how we go fast.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the pandemic, IKEA invested in all kinds of fulfillment optimizations, including <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/03\/10\/ikea-looks-to-optoro-to-minimize-online-return-waste\">bringing in Optoro<\/a> to reduce waste from returns and utilizing chatbots, digital dashboards, and more <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/03\/next-up-on-ikeas-digital-transformation-menu-meatballs\">to streamline shipping and receiving<\/a> for the retailer\u2019s famous meatballs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coppola\u2019s overall thoughts on fulfillment nicely echo IKEA\u2019s sentiment towards the future of retail. It\u2019s about empowering the consumer by giving them options.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat&#8217;s important is to create a choice and let consumers choose,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a convenience ladder of different services for people to pick from.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is no doubt that retail will look and feel different once the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end.
