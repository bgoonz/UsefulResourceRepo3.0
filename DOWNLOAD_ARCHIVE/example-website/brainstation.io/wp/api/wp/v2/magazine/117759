The design features a dedicated curbside delivery drive-in lane, where customers can pick up wait for pre-orders made on the Burger King app. Additionally, the new restaurants will have pickup lockers, also for pre-orders; multi-lane drive-thrus, including one that is dedicated to delivery drivers; and an outdoor walk-up pickup window. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burger King&#8217;s new restaurants will be 60% smaller than the chain&#8217;s average location, due to less dine-in space, plus a suspended kitchen. Drive-thru customers will have their orders delivered to their cars from a conveyor belt system that is attached to this kitchen. Additionally, there will be a covered outdoor seating area where customers can dine. The emphasis overall will be on the ease of ordering ahead via Burger King&#8217;s app. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/09\/13094922\/960x0.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-117774\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/09\/13094922\/960x0.jpg 960w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/09\/13094922\/960x0-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/09\/13094922\/960x0-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><figcaption>Burger King&#8217;s new concept focuses on order-ahead. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn March our in-house design and tech team accelerated new restaurant design plans and pushed the limits of what a Burger King restaurant could be,\u201d Josh Kobza, COO of Restaurant Brands, said in a statement. \u201cWe took into consideration how consumer behaviors are changing and our guests will want to interact with our restaurants.

Similar to the Burger King design, Taco Bell&#8217;s planned, smaller-footprint restaurants will feature two drive-thru lanes, including one that&#8217;s dedicated to mobile pre-orders, pickup shelves, tablet ordering, and curbside pickup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restaurant Brands has posted a substantial revenue dip for Q2 of 2020: the company <a href=\"http:\/\/cnbc.com\/2020\/08\/06\/restaurant-brands-international-qsr-q2-2020-earnings.html\">was down 25% compared to a year earlier<\/a>, with Burger King in particular posting same-store sales declines of 13.4%.
