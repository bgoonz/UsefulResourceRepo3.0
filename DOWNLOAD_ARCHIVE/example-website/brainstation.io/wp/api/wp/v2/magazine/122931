Overall online sales for Walmart increased 69% in the quarter, up from the 35% increase during the same time last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walmart Canada demonstrated a huge commitment to digital innovation over the course of 2020, as COVID-19 drastically shifted shopping patterns. \u201cCOVID accelerated many of our digital aspirations,\u201d Nicolai Salcedo, Walmart Canada\u2019s chief information officer, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/12\/24\/walmart-canada-puts-customer-experience-at-center-stage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said in December of last year<\/a>. \u201cFor Walmart Canada, our ideal digital experience, whether it is in-store or online, starts with our customers in mind. We start designing things by listening to what our customers need.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Walmart, this included a $3.5 billion investment in \u201cstores of the future,&#8221; which included <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/04\/walmart-canada-invests-110-million-for-online-focused-physical-upgrades\" target=\"_blank\">earmarking<\/a> $110 million for online-focused physical upgrades, such as the construction of two new micro-fulfillment centers. An existing hybrid concept store, in Vaughan, Ontario, currently serves as an incubator to test omnichannel capabilities and features. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investment also includes a plan for 10 hybrid locations, with expanded fulfillment space; renovations to make space for e-commerce capabilities; the expansion of Walmart Grocery Pickup to 70% of Canadian locations by the end of the year; and the hiring of new staff who will be assigned to omnichannel-related roles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on an earnings call this week, Judith McKenna, Walmart&#8217;s President and CEO, also pointed out that Spark\u2014the company&#8217;s in-house courier service\u2014was launched first in Canada, further underscoring the company&#8217;s Canadian commitment to customer service-led innovation. Spark is now available in the US and Mexico; delivery, McKenna said, is a huge part of Walmart&#8217;s current business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now doing about 1.5 million deliveries each and every week from stores, which is more than seven times what we were doing a year ago,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing this through a combination of our own Spark Driver platform and third-parties. We&#8217;re quickly getting items to customers and we expect to see delivery costs to continue to go down as we build volume and density.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>McKenna also noted that Walmart has enabled 586 on-demand stores at 1,390 pickup locations, built 63 stores, opened three new distribution centers, and rolled out Spark&#8217;s last-mile delivery program to almost 30 stores. &#8220;Going forward, we will double down on each of these fronts,&#8221; she added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walmart has launched a number of digital initiatives this year that have helped contribute to its e-comm success, including the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/07\/28\/walmart-marketplace-doubles-in-size-with-help-from-shopify\" target=\"_blank\">expansion of its third-party marketplace<\/a>, a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/12\/17\/walmart-tests-livestream-shopping-with-tiktok\" target=\"_blank\">livestream shopping pilot<\/a> with TikTok, and the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/09\/01\/walmart-set-to-launch-september-15\" target=\"_blank\">launch of Walmart+<\/a>, its subscription program. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Digital sales grew 229% in the quarter ending January 31 for the retailer&#8217;s stores in Canada.
