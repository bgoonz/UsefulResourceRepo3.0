This is one of the ways we&#8217;re reimagining experiences to meet the evolving expectations of Canadians, and offering them more options to pay for larger purchases at competitive rates.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bread was acquired by loyalty services provider Alliance Data in December of last year. Its president, Derek Joyce, said the partnership with RBC is a step toward fulfilling the company&#8217;s &#8220;mission of offering more ways for people to pay globally.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to work with RBC, the largest bank in&nbsp;Canada, to expand our reach and provide a robust digital payment solution at the point-of-sale, giving shoppers convenient payment options and more choices at checkout,&#8221; Joyce said. &#8220;We know that through this strategic alliance, we can help thousands of RBC&#8217;s merchant partners increase their e-commerce sales and profits.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PayPlan integrates seamlessly with merchants&#8217; e-commerce platforms and will be presented to customers when they check out as a payment option. Customers who complete the three-step approvals process for PayPlan are approved within seconds and can select from installment payment plans with terms of between 6-36 months, and interest as low as 0%. There are no hidden fees, and customers are not required to begin repayment until 30 days after their purchase. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buy now, pay later technology has spiked in popularity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers look for more flexible payment options due to sudden financial insecurity. Leaders in the field include Klarna and Splitit, and a number of fintechs and traditional banks have launched their own BNPL tools within the past year, including <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/11\/18\/paypal-is-setting-the-pace-of-digital-fintech-innovation-in-2020\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal<\/a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/08\/04\/citi-introduces-buy-now-pay-later-option-for-amazon-purchases\" target=\"_blank\">Citi<\/a>, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/09\/03\/american-express-launches-new-pay-over-time-option\" target=\"_blank\">American Express<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>RBC, meanwhile, has launched a number of tools in recent months to better serve its customers in an increasingly contact-free banking ecosystem.
