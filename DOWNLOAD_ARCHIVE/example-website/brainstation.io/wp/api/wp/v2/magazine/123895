Goldman&#8217;s investment comes just one month after Starling raised $380 million in an investment round, increasing its valuation to roughly $1.5 billion. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSecuring the support of another global financial heavyweight demonstrates the strength of demand from investors,&#8221; said Starling CEO and founder Anne Boden, adding that the Goldman investment &#8220;represents yet another vote of confidence in Starling.&#8221; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Goldman has been working to increase its digital banking\u2014and consumer-focused\u2014capabilities in recent months, most notably with Marcus, its consumer-facing bank, which <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/10\/15\/goldman-sachs-marcus-grew-by-4-billion-last-quarter\" target=\"_blank\">grew by $4 billion<\/a> in the quarter that ended in October of last year. Marcus, which Goldman debuted in 2016, will <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/01\/14\/goldman-taps-marqeta-to-launch-marcus-checking-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">launch checking accounts<\/a> by the end of this year; the investment in Starling will likely help Goldman better understand how it can continue to grow its own digital banking products and tools. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cStarling is one of the leading and most innovative digital banks in the U.K., with an ambitious technology-first leadership team and addressing a deep market opportunity,\u201d Goldman Sachs managing director James Hayward said in a statement of the investment. \u201cWe are delighted to be supporting their growth with this investment and believe the company has sustainable long-term earnings potential.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Goldman investment in Starling comes after competing investment firms JPMorgan and Barclays allegedly showed interest in purchasing the UK-based fintech, though Starling has denied those rumours. The bank is a rising fintech star, however, with more than 2 million users (of which 350,000 are business clients), and about $8.3 billion in deposits. Starling is reportedly planning an expansion into Europe this year. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the planned launch of checking accounts, Marcus also recently <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/09\/15\/goldman-sachs-adds-personal-finance-tools-to-marcus\" target=\"_blank\">added a number of personal finance tools<\/a> to its app and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2021\/02\/16\/goldman-sachs-launches-robo-advising-through-marcus-invest\" target=\"_blank\">introduced robo-investing<\/a> earlier this year. The latter tool brings Goldman Sachs&#8217; investment expertise, historically reserved for affluent and enterprise customers, to individual consumers and investors, as part of a larger effort by the bank to democratize its services. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Need to Know Goldman Sachs\u2019 growth equity investment arm has invested $69 million in Starling, one of the UK&#8217;s biggest digital-only banks.
