Vancouver is home to several world-class educational institutions and talent incubators, which have contributed to a workforce capable of supporting such a vibrant tech industry\u2014attracting students from within the local community and from other places in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/09\/13100113\/Clio-Office-9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-91777\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/09\/13100113\/Clio-Office-9-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/09\/13100113\/Clio-Office-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/09\/13100113\/Clio-Office-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/09\/13100113\/Clio-Office-9-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/09\/13100113\/Clio-Office-9.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Inside Clio&#8217;s sprawling office<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Psiharis also notes that with the influx of remote work due to the pandemic, professionals are migrating to emerging tech hubs and prioritizing that ever-important work-life balance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe booming tech economy provides unbeatable career opportunities for people interested in being a part of the next big tech community,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been a wild ride over the last few years\u2013both at Clio and across the Vancouver tech community as a whole. The growth we\u2019ve seen has been explosive, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down. It\u2019s truly a thrill to have both helped build and to be benefitting from a world-class tech ecosystem, built on top talent and business-friendly infrastructure\u2013all in one of the most beautiful settings in the country.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other freshly minted Vancouver unicorns include NFT firm Dapper Labs, cybersecurity company GeoComply, and AbCellera, a biomedical research firm known for creating the first COVID-19 antibody treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For tech industry folks looking to leave Ontario and Quebec, Vancouver is able to provide the work opportunities it previously may not have offered. The CBRE&#8217;s 2021 <em>Scoring Tech Talent<\/em> confirms this, with Vancouver climbing one spot to become the 11th best destination for tech talent in North America, trailing only Toronto and Ottawa in terms of other Canadian cities. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with Vancouver, Halifax has also experienced an increase in new residents, growing 39% since the start of the pandemic, offering many of the same benefits, except on the east coast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic put the world on pause, many saw the downtime as an opportunity to reflect and reconnect with what they truly want out of life.
