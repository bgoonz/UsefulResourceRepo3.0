That also means our reliance on technology created to replace those activities will also transition to some kind of companion experience. It may also mean the end of livestreamed living room concerts and Zoom drinks with friends, but that\u2019s a pretty easy trade-off.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment (MLSE) chief technology and digital officer Humza Teherany, the question wasn\u2019t so much about getting sports back to normal, but rather, what could normal sports look like post-pandemic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen COVID hit, the whole sports and entertainment industry was halted,\u201d explains Teherany. \u201cEvery team in North America was asking, \u201cHow do we play? How do we get fans in?\u2019 And we were focused on that, of course\u2014but also, about a month and a half into the pandemic, we started to also think, \u2018What would sports be like once we return?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer showcases an incredible look at how sports\u2014just like nearly every other industry in the world\u2014has evolved to fit the \u201cevery company is a tech company\u201d adage, and even more particularly, the increasing need to focus on customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;About a month and a half into the pandemic, we started to think, \u2018What would sports be like once we return?\u2019\u201d<\/p><cite>Humza Teherany, chief technology and digital officer, MLSE<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs we began to talk about the new normal for sports, we always started with the experience,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cBefore we talked about new technology, or how it might all work, we realized that the concept of an arena was gone.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, MLSE\u2019s vision of a digital arena was born.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is a digital arena? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MLSE is one of the largest sports organizations in North America, overseeing two separate billion-dollar teams in the NHL\u2019s Toronto Maple Leafs and the NBA\u2019s Toronto Raptors, as well as the MLS&#8217; rapidly-growing Toronto Football Club (TFC).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially unveiled last month, MLSE\u2019s digital arena has been in development since May 2020 and beta-launched in August. The entire early prototype for the digital arena was built in just 45 days, helped along by a partnership with Canadian startup Tradable Bits Media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital arena offers fans a number of ways to connect with their favorite teams and other fans. Currently, the digital arena experience is offered through both the Toronto Maple Leafs app as well as the Toronto Raptors app (both of which are the most popular apps in their respective professional leagues) and will be expanded to include the TFC shortly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a fan enters the app, they will see a prompt to join the digital arena. Once inside, there are different activities and games to take part in, all designed to act as a second-screen experience and enhance typical at-home viewing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"792\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/mlse-digital-arena2-1024x792.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123638\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/mlse-digital-arena2-1024x792.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/mlse-digital-arena2-730x565.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/mlse-digital-arena2-768x594.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/mlse-digital-arena2-300x232.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/mlse-digital-arena2.jpg 1300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Integration with Major League Soccer is coming shortly, according to MLSE. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most engaging attractions is predictive trivia. Based on the current game, there are questions posed to the user, such as \u201cWhen was the last time the Raptors wore these alternate jerseys?\u201d If answered correctly, the user receives points they can then redeem for a number of rewards. There are also events such as virtual t-shirt tosses that can also score a fan some points (but not a t-shirt, at least for now).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engagement numbers have been higher than predicted, too, with more than half of the digital arena participants taking part in the different activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;60% of the people in the digital arena are playing the games and using predictive trivia,\u201d explains Christian Magsisi, senior director of technology and digital at MLSE.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;60% of the people in the digital arena are playing the games and using predictive trivia.\u201d<\/p><cite>Christian Magsisi, senior director of technology and digital, MLSE<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital arena also features different sections for fans to \u201cwatch from,\u201d each with their own live chat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe high engagement is important because we know we can build community through chat, but to be a true second-screen experience, we want the fans to engage with us through the interactive elements in the digital arena,\u201d says Magsisi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey can have that digital camaraderie and can now actually talk to other fans,\u201d adds Teherany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teherany is especially excited about this chat function. He realizes chat is nothing new, but MLSE&#8217;s presentation turns it into a dynamic and engaging experience. People will be able to set up private chat rooms with friends, and team alumni and mascots may drop by to say hello. In addition, test rooms set up with season ticket holders led to different fans reaching out to one another, connecting much in the same way they would as if they were sitting a row back from one another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt&#8217;s the way we&#8217;ve integrated the chat into the mobile experience and made it native and put game presentation around it. You could be tracking the score, you&#8217;re seeing trivia, you&#8217;re seeing all these things, and the chat is really the central point,\u201d says Teherany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He points to a recent moment when Maple Leafs star forward Auston Matthews scored an overtime winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you see that happen, you see comments and emojis fly, just like people would be buzzing in a real arena,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cIt&#8217;s inspiring to see the conversation between our fans during COVID when they can&#8217;t be in an arena together, but you can still feel some of that energy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bridging the physical\/digital divide<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key value add for MLSE\u2019s digital arena is the introduction of detailed stat tracking. This is arguably the most vital component of the experience as it offers something for the dedicated superfans, even once they\u2019re allowed back in stadiums.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the stats section is a bit bare, but it will grow over the next few months. In 2019, the NHL introduced league-wide tracking technology for both the puck and players inside every arena and that information will be fed directly into the digital experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"793\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-1024x793.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123629\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-730x565.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-1460x1130.jpg 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-768x595.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-1536x1189.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final-300x232.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-final.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>A look at different features within MLSE&#8217;s digital arena apps. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But MLSE Digital Labs (the innovation arm of MLSE), in collaboration with the NHL, built its own front-end stat tracking technology that will act as a differentiator to keep fans engaged inside the digital arena.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our own puck and player tracking visualization engine that gets plugged into our apps,\u201d explains Teherany. \u201cIt takes the streaming data off the ice and brings it into our visualization engine, providing an amazingly beautiful and exclusive experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The depth of the engine is vast: fans will be able to select a specific player and see stats such as real-time skating speed; breakout paths around the ice; the zones he is spending the most time in, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen we beta tested that technology, it was just remarkable to see that data streaming off the ice,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cThose are the things that continue to be game-changers for us in terms of our development roadmap and filling out that experience in the digital sense.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond building a leading second-screen stat experience, MLSE is also working on other ways to connect the digital world to the physical one. Any sports fan that has watched a game in the last year knows that there has been artificial crowd noise pumped into the empty live games. Even though it sounds similar, it\u2019s just not the same\u2014so as part of the digital experience, MLSE wanted to empower fans to make their own noise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere are moments in the digital arena that you can&#8217;t share with others\u2014you can&#8217;t get up and stand and shout with other fans, right?\u201d says Teherany. \u201cThat&#8217;s one of the most fun parts of being at a game.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution was a \u2018Get Loud\u2019 button. Digital arena fans can rapidly press the logoed buttons and generate crowd noise for pivotal moments in the respective game. It\u2019s straightforward enough\u2014press a button, hear a bit of noise\u2014but it\u2019s a deceptively simple way to continually connect digital fans with the in-person experience. And to answer the question: no, there is not a feature coming to press a button and jeer referees for making a bad call.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRegardless of whether you&#8217;re watching at home or watching in Shanghai, you can actually now participate in a digital arena and it doesn&#8217;t cost you anything to get in,\u201d says Teherany.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cRegardless of whether you&#8217;re watching at home or in Shanghai, you can now participate in a digital arena and it doesn&#8217;t cost you anything to get in.\u201d<\/p><cite>Humza Teherany<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>MLSE Digital Labs is continually experimenting with new ways to connect the app to physical experiences. Some of the obvious ones, such as ordering food from seats and integrating digital ticketing, already exist. Less obvious ones may roll out soon, including digital wayfinding that points fans to less-crowded entrances, or even their seats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think the collision of the physical world and the digital world will be interesting and will evolve post-COVID,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cWe have the number one user base in both the NHL and the NBA, so we have millions of active fans across all of our platforms to introduce this technology to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Digital innovation meets professional sports<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MLSE\u2019s decision to develop a digital arena is a testament to the weight digital innovation now carries within professional sports. When Digital spoke with <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2019\/03\/26\/mlse-leading-digital-revolution-in-sports\">Teherany two years ago<\/a>, he stated that MLSE benchmarks itself against \u201cnot only other sports and entertainment companies and leagues but also against big technology companies and how they approach problems.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prevailing trend among leading technology companies has been to obsess over the customer experience. \u201cWe see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts,\u201d Jeff Bezos famously said while building Amazon into the world\u2019s largest retailer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for MLSE, controlling one leading sports team would be more than enough incentive to build a digital fan experience\u2014but controlling three made the decision table-stakes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-digital-1024x614.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-digital-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-digital-730x438.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-digital-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-digital-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/04\/13094841\/digital-arena-digital.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Other professional teams (including the San Antonio Spurs) have also purchased MLSE&#8217;s digital arena technology. <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the perks of being a massive sports organization is the vastly increased allowance for digital innovation. MLSE Digital Labs is the largest of its kind in North America, featuring nearly 150 engineers, designers, marketers, and more who wake up every morning thinking about how to connect with fans online. That team has grown over the last year, but even before the pandemic sped up every business\u2019 digital roadmap, digital was a priority at MLSE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would say the pandemic has definitely heightened our digital awareness, but I actually don&#8217;t think our focus has changed,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cThe openness to think of ourselves as an enabler of our business through technology has been there well before COVID.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was this culture of innovation that led to the development of the digital arena. The idea came from an early \u201cWhat-if?\u201d session held inside the labs, when many MLSE Digital Labs members kept pitching different experiences they missed from physical arenas, without ever notion of developing new features to replace them. Teherany and his team realized all of the different ideas could come together and form a united experience, much like an in-person NHL or NBA game is itself a microcosm of different events and activities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAgain, experience is the keyword, because we weren&#8217;t sitting there and talking about features,&#8221; he says. &#8220;As we went through these conversations, you try to connect the dots. It wasn\u2019t just like if someone said, \u2018Hey, let&#8217;s build a digital arena.\u2019 It was all about the concept of an experience that we thought could add value for fans.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sharing success<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest validation of the digital arena efforts came when MLSE Digital Labs was approached by two other NBA teams: the Portland Trail Blazers and San Antonio Spurs. Both teams wanted t<span class=\"has-inline-color has-very-dark-gray-color\">o buy <\/span>the digital arena technology off MLSE.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that before,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cThese organizations were talking about how they buy technology from other vendors, so why not buy from each other? So my answer to that was, \u2018Sure!\u2019 It was pretty organic.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these conversations happened during meetings of the NBA\u2019s Team Innovation Advisory Council, which features members from seven teams discussing new ways to innovate the game of basketball. Teherany represents the Raptors from the digital innovation perspective, and because leagues like the NBA and NHL are very collegial, there is a lot of discussion around IP and sharing best practices, along with how new technology can make the game more accessible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the notion of a professional sports organization building an internal technology platform and selling it to another team is unprecedented, Teherany is quick to point out it\u2019s just like working with any other vendor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLook: we&#8217;re not smarter than everybody else,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have the same outlook on where things are going.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also the opportunity to integrate new commercial partnerships in the future. MLSE lists potential features such as direct-to-consumer subscriptions and memberships, embedded e-commerce, and even in-game betting as advantages to buying and utilizing the digital arena technology. There is no word as to when these could roll out, but as sports betting laws become increasingly relaxed across North America, there is massive potential to bring gambling directly inside team apps. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With digital arena technology now rolled out and thousands of fans engaging with different activities within the app, MLSE understands that the lack of in-person crowds offered a perfect opportunity to build a second-screen experience fans will be drawn into.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe like to be pragmatic,\u201d says Teherany. \u201cWe like to build our innovation based on an opportunity and a problem that we&#8217;re solving.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s now the organization&#8217;s mission to ensure the digital arena continues to appeal to fans, even as they trickle back into arenas and cheer in person. With exclusive data visualization engines, stat tracking technology, and engaging contests, MLSE is certainly on the right path\u2014now it\u2019s just up to the teams to put up a few Ws themselves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The global pandemic has instilled a sense of longing for the recreational activities people once took for granted: dining with friends, standing shoulder-to-shoulder at a concert, watching a live sporting event\u2014the list goes on.&nbsp; Thankfully, the pandemic will eventually end and people will gradually return to their favorite weekend routines.
