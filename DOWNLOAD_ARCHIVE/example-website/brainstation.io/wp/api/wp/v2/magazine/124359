To do so, customers can upload a photo of themselves, or select from different models made available by Walmart and Zeekit encompassing different heights, sizes, and skin colors. Zeekit also allows shoppers to share images of the outfits they&#8217;re virtually trying on with their friends, in order to get a second opinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"852\" height=\"453\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/13094837\/Walamrt_zeekit2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-124364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/13094837\/Walamrt_zeekit2.png 852w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/13094837\/Walamrt_zeekit2-730x388.png 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/13094837\/Walamrt_zeekit2-768x408.png 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/05\/13094837\/Walamrt_zeekit2-300x160.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Virtual try-on is a game-changer and solves what has historically been one of the most difficult things to replicate online: understanding fit and how an item will actually look on you,&#8221; Denise Incandela, EVP of apparel and private brands for Walmart wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. &#8220;Zeekit will help us deliver an inclusive, immersive and personalized experience for our diverse customer base.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incandela added in the blog post that Walmart may leverage Zeekit&#8217;s technology for other uses in the future, including the ability to build the world\u2019s largest virtual closet and &#8220;mix and match clothing seamlessly.&#8221; Three members of Zeekit&#8217;s executive team, including the CEO, CTO, and VP of research and development will join Walmart. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtual try-on tools have skyrocketed in popularity over the last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic drove more customers to shop online, and retailers attempted to increase virtual consumer engagement and confidence.
