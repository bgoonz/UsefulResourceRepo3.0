The digital \u201cdiscovery center\u201d is launching in celebration of Nike\u2019s new All Conditions Gear (ACG) HO20 collection.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing augmented reality technology from Hovercraft, Nike shoppers can use their mobile phones to learn more about Nike products and interact with animated wildlife.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By walking through an interactive geozone with a digital checklist, shoppers can track their progress through a series of AR challenges. By using their phones to scan QR codes located on the floor as they move throughout the space, shoppers will reveal animated figures and product information. Upon completion, they are rewarded with \u201ca physical gift brought to them by a masked store associate and a digital AR model of the Nike \u201cACG Hiker\u201d mascot they can keep on their phone.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/492729974\" width=\"855\" height=\"530\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/492729974\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the onset of the pandemic, the iconic athletics brand has been leaning on tech to engage customers in new ways.
