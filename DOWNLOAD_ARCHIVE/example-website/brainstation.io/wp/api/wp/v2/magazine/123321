Despite HSBC&#8217;s business having largely migrated to digital mediums, with more than 90% of interactions taking place online, call-center operations remain integral to HSBC&#8217;s business for customers seeking assistance; about 1.5 million customers access the bank&#8217;s call centers annually. But because there are often language barriers to navigate, quality assurance is often difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Google. HSBC&#8217;s Intelligence Hub, a team of data scientists, engineers, and architects, teamed up with Google Cloud to find ways to leverage HSBC&#8217;s call center data using AI and machine learning. The result was an Automatic Quality Management system (AQM), a voice-processing solution powered by AI that identifies areas of improvement in customer conversations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool is the first of its kind, and will substantially decrease the amount of time HSBC invests in analyzing call feedback and implementing changes to its call center processes based on those analyses \u2014&nbsp;for instance, HSBC will be able to more quickly identify call center agents who could benefit from coaching, and gather data on customer service successes and failures that can be leveraged into adjustments to HSBC&#8217;s call center processes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team that developed the new AI-driven AQM was lead by Maru Chu, who explained in a press release announcing the new tool that the teams used &#8220;AutoML Natural Language&nbsp;and&nbsp;Speech-to-Text&nbsp;to train machine learning models to classify, extract, and detect customer sentiment.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Bates, global head of HSBC\u2019s intelligence hub, wealth and personal banking, HSBC, said that, in addition to improving the current customer journey, the insights provided by the new AI would help with designing &#8220;future customer journeys or work on staff training and reinforcement. Theoretically, it will involve 1,200 man-hours to monitor 100% of our sales calls. It is now unnecessary to spend this amount of time for monitoring,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of retailers, banks, and other consumer-facing organizations have turned to Google Cloud in recent months to optimize their customer experience.
