The Toronto-based self-driving car startup launched to the public early last month, catching many in the industry by surprise after <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2021\/06\/08\/2243365\/0\/en\/Waabi-launches-to-build-a-pathway-to-commercially-viable-scalable-autonomous-driving.html\" target=\"_blank\">earning more than $83.5 million in Series A funding<\/a> led by Khosla Ventures, with additional funding from high-profile backers including Uber. The investment brings the commercialization of autonomous vehicles a giant step closer to reality, not least of all due to Waabi&#8217;s proprietary AI tech, which is backed by Urtasun&#8217;s two decades of experience in the field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The more time I\u2019ve spent in this industry, the more certain I\u2019ve become about what it will take to actually bring this technology to life,&#8221; Urtasun says. &#8220;Our AI-first approach is unique in the industry and, I believe, key to commercializing this technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A history of self-driving expertise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Urtasun founded Waabi after four years behind the wheel at Uber&#8217;s Advanced Technologies Group, where she oversaw the company&#8217;s self-driving car lab. Urtasun is also a co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI, the high-profile Toronto-based AI research hub that also names AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton as its chief scientific advisor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During her tenure leading all things self-driving with Uber, the company invested hundreds of millions of dollars in autonomous tech, with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/04\/11\/uber-spent-457-million-on-self-driving-and-flying-car-rd-last-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nearly $500 million<\/a> being invested in self-driving and flying car R&amp;D in 2019 alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at Uber, Urtasun realized the need for commercially viable self-driving vehicles \u2014 and the fact that, currently, the autonomous vehicle industry is not leveraging AI tech nearly as much as it should be. Rather than apply her idea for an AI-first approach to driverless vehicles to Uber, Urtasun <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.utoronto.ca\/news\/road-ahead-raquel-urtasun-s-startup-unleash-full-power-ai-self-driving-cars\" target=\"_blank\">told the University of Toronto Magazine that<\/a> &#8220;if you really want to change technology, the best way to do it is to start a new company.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1390\" height=\"926\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Urtasun-ATG-Car-Toronto.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-124911\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Urtasun-ATG-Car-Toronto.jpg 1390w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Urtasun-ATG-Car-Toronto-730x486.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/23104034\/Urtasun-ATG-Car-Toronto-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px\" \/><figcaption>Urtasun standing in front of a self-driving Uber ATG car she helped develop.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>A new approach to autonomous driving<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;AI-first approach&#8221; is, indeed, what sets Waabi apart: &#8220;If you look at the more traditional approaches to building self-driving technology, AI is simply one piece of the puzzle,&#8221; Urtasun says. &#8220;At Waabi, AI is at the center of the solution.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s AI system&#8217;s advantages are threefold: it is interpretable, end-to-end trainable, and capable of complex reasoning. Interpretability means Waabi&#8217;s AI produces representations that are explainable, which allows the company&#8217;s engineers to trace back the reasons why the AI system made a particular decision. End-to-end trainability means that the entire self-driving system can be learned from data, which speeds up development, and its complex reasoning capabilities mean Waabi&#8217;s AI is able to closely mimic the human decision-making process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Our AI-first approach is unique in the industry and, I believe, key to commercializing this technology.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of Waabi<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These facets potentially put Waabi&#8217;s AI tech leagues above competitors. When combined with the fact that Waabi&#8217;s technology is being developed entirely in simulation, the model potentially circumvents the massive safety concerns that have plagued the self-driving industry so far. With Waabi\u2019s technology and approach, there is less of a need to log millions of miles driving with a physical car on the open road\u2014an approach her previous employer Uber focused on. Instead, those test miles can be simulated to the same degree of safety and scaled exponentially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI tech she&#8217;s pioneering with her team at Waabi will first focus on trucking. Highway driving, while challenging, is an easier problem for Waabi to solve than city driving, and by focusing on the trucking industry, Waabi will be able to fine-tune its AI tech while also solving the issues of safety and chronic driver shortages that plague the trucking industry. Urtasun points to Waabi\u2019s closed-loop simulator as another example of how the company is leading its competitors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOther companies are using simulation technology, but at scale, they test only motion planning,\u201d she says. \u201c[Our] closed loop simulator \u2026 enables us to test at scale both common driving scenarios as well as safety-critical edge cases. This is a game-changer, as we significantly reduce the need to drive in the real world in order to understand how our system performs.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFurthermore, our autonomy system can learn to act in situations we might have never seen before by training our AI-first approach in simulation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like this: if a self-driving AI company\u2019s first approach to training their system is through driving on real roads and logging that data, it may only run into certain situations (for example, a low-visibility blizzard at night) a handful of times. With Waabi\u2019s system, that scenario can be replicated and trained thousands, if not millions of times, without wheels ever touching the asphalt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Commercializing self-driving<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Waabi will be entering a highly competitive field here, as leading AV companies including Google&#8217;s Waymo, Aurora, and car manufacturers Daimler and Volvo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/6\/8\/22522824\/waabi-raquel-urtasun-autonomous-vehicle-startup-stealth-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">are all competing<\/a> to be the first to introduce autonomous tractor-trailers to the highway.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urtasun says she believes Waabi\u2019s AI-first approach will quickly move the company towards a commercial product but acknowledges that there are a number of external factors \u2014 including regulatory confidence in Waabi\u2019s tech, in addition to consumer buy-in \u2014 that will determine just how quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I intend to lead the industry in transparency and accountability.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Raquel Urtasun<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCommercialization requires regulators and communities buying in, as you mentioned.
