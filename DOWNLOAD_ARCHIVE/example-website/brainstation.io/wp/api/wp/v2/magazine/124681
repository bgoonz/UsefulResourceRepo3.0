Fintech companies are launching new and improved digital banking services every week, and now customers can easily send and receive money, pay bills, and even deposit cheques, all through a non-traditional banking platform accessible directly through their phones.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The customer demand for digital banking is high: in recent years, digital banks worldwide have grown at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.frontier-enterprise.com\/the-rise-and-rise-of-digital-banks\/\" target=\"_blank\">three times<\/a> the rate of traditional banks. This demand was accelerated even further by the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lizfrazierpeck\/2021\/01\/15\/pandemic-accelerated-digital-banking-tools-in-2020-that-will-continue-far-beyond\/?sh=55c6c62d1623\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">54% of banking customers<\/a> to use digital options more frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the UK\u2019s biggest digital bank, Revolut, things are moving forward even faster. Due to the pandemic, the company experienced slower growth than usual in 2020, but after adding a slate of new products and expanding into thirty-one new markets, the digital bank\u2019s revenue increased by 130% in the first quarter of 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rapid growth and expansion of Revolut showcase Europe\u2019s\u2014and most of the world\u2019s, for that matter\u2014increasing reliance on digital banking options. Just five years ago, it would have been unfathomable to think a digital platform could rival the services offered by HSBC or Barclays. But halfway through 2021, Revolut is proving to be more than just a competitor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs the extraordinary circumstances of 2020 drove the trend towards digital financial management, we continued to innovate for customers to make their financial lives easier and accelerate daily use,\u201d Revolut\u2019s founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/21\/revolut-revenue-grew-by-57-in-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said in a statement<\/a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Crypto and new markets = growth<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Revolut, which is building \u201cthe world\u2019s first truly global super-app\u201d launched in the UK in 2015. The platform began by offering only money transfers and exchanges, now evolving to provide prepaid cards, savings accounts, access to cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Revolut\u2019s key differentiators\u2014and a key propellor to the company&#8217;s 2020 growth\u2014is that it provides easy access to cryptocurrency. The digital bank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/revolut-adds-11-cryptocurrencies-to-its-trading-offerings\">added 11 new crypto tokens<\/a> this past year. Revolut users can trade Cardano, Uniswap, Synthetix, and more, as well as withdraw Bitcoin in a much more streamlined manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"390\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-1024x390.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-124776\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-1024x390.png 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-730x278.png 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-1460x556.png 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-768x293.png 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-1536x585.png 1536w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header-300x114.png 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16153443\/Brand_Retail_Marketing-2021_Revolut-app-GLOBAL-Version-8_Blog-Header.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Expansion is also a key part of Revolut\u2019s growth strategy. The company expanded into the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.revolut.com\/us-welcome-to-revolut\/\" target=\"_blank\">United States<\/a> and ten <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.revolut.com\/revolut-bank-expands-into-10-european-markets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">European<\/a> markets earlier this year, making it now available in 31 countries and counting.&nbsp; 15 million users are now logging on to manage their banking through Revolut.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revolut partnered with translation and localization startup Lokalise to support the rollout into so many new markets. \u201cLocalizing\u201d an app involves making it available to citizens in their native language and norms, allowing for equitable access to banking technology to new demographics, and also facilitates a young company\u2019s growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By working with Lokalise, Revolut improved its localization flexibility, which \u201cmade it possible to increase the speed of rollout to new markets,&#8221; according to Revolut\u2019s operations manager Theo Williams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This increased focus on localization has allowed Revolut to add five million new users in just one year\u2014a staggering number that represents the fintech\u2019s best year ever.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansion into the United States is also a huge move for the UK bank. Moving into North America is a huge opportunity for Revolut, and it hinges on the platform\u2019s ability to become a \u201csuper-app\u201d\u2014codeword for a one-stop financial shop.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the U.S., fintechs just do one thing \u2014 and they do it well,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/thefinancialbrand.com\/115750\/how-revoluts-super-app-strategy-could-shake-up-u-s-banking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">says Storonsky<\/a>. \u201cWe offer all the tools you need in your financial life.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, 150,000 U.S. users have joined Revolut, but the fintech\u2019s target is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fnlondon.com\/articles\/revolut-to-launch-major-us-blitz-as-it-targets-a-million-users-this-year-20210406\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one million users<\/a> by the end of the year.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scaling the platform<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Between global expansion and the addition of countless new products and services, Revolut\u2019s growth strategy is paying off. The company reported $361 million in revenue (\u00a3261 million) \u2014 a 57% increase from the year prior \u2014 including $54 million (\u00a339 million) in fair value gains on cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, Revolut raised major funding, too. The company secured a $580 million Series D funding round, which has backed the company\u2019s huge plans to expand through the U.S. and into new European markets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond those new markets, Revolut has also expanded its service offerings. Late last year, Revolut launched its web app. After solely existing as an app, the new Revolut Web App gives users easy access to their banking services from desktop, offering a full view of transactions and bank balances, and providing an alternative to the smartphone app as needed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revolut also launched a Honey-like new feature called <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.revolut.com\/meet-revolut-shopper\/\" target=\"_blank\">Revolut Shopper<\/a>. The browser extension helps you find and automatically apply discount codes while shopping and receive cashback bonuses from select retailers. And its Smart Subscriptions feature lets users manage and track any subscriptions or automatic debits in one easy place. Revolut also debuted a paid, upgraded plan that promises to protect users from fraud and theft.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Digital banking is here to stay<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital banks provide an easy-to-use alternative that is popular with younger demographics: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/dontdisappoint.me.uk\/resources\/digital\/digital-banking-statistics-uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">46% o<\/a>f Gen Z bankers are using a digital bank account.
