It also might just refer to ordering albums from the U.S. and reselling them to fans around his old Paris stomping ground. Either way, Haddad wants to get you something you need and make sure it\u2019s as painless as possible, even if he has to keep a couple vinyls or a Porsche 911 himself for quality assurance.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Beirut, Lebanon, Haddad lived through years of civil war that resulted in his apartment block being bombed, forcing him out of the country.\u00a0He relocated to France and lived there for a decade and a half, graduating school and landing a job with Proctor &amp; Gamble. It was there he was tasked with marketing laundry detergent, \u201cwhich was as exciting as can be,\u201d he laughs.<\/p>\n<p>A love of house music (he recommends Masters at Work or Dimitri from Paris)\u00a0helped lead Haddad to find where he truly belongs\u2014e-commerce.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I discovered eBay and that I could just do some arbitrage\u2014buying vinyl and CDs in the U.S., keeping some then reselling others, I got addicted,\u201d Haddad says. \u201cThen I thought: Why am I doing this in the U.S.? There are untapped opportunities here in Europe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He enlisted a few friends and helped found iBazar in the late nineties, one of the first sites of its kind. At a time when the internet was still gaining traction, the site had close to 2.5 million users in eight countries\u2014not even including North America.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was in my 20s and didn&#8217;t know much about starting a company, but it was lucky. The right place at the right time\u2014it was the beginning of the web and part of the first internet wave,\u201d says Haddad.<\/p>\n<p>iBazar did well, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make it through the dot-com bubble unscathed. A mere 15 years after the bombs fell on his home in Beirut, the company sold to eBay for $150 million and he stayed on to\u00a0head the site&#8217;s European division.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s when Haddad\u2019s trajectory really began to accelerate.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-99441\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Turo-A-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Turo A\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Turo-A-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Turo-A-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Turo-A-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Turo-A-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Turo-A.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had an incredible and unexpectedly long career venture. I pioneered this whole idea of user experience and design, which didn&#8217;t exist really formally at the time. Now we take that for granted, but at the time it was new,\u201d says Haddad.<\/p>\n<p>After seeing eBay do so well, he wanted to step back into a more scrappy and entrepreneurial role, \u201csomething that would provide me the type of satisfaction I felt at iBazar,\u201d he explains.<\/p>\n<p>Haddad left eBay in 2011 with the plans of taking some time to himself\u2014until he ran into Shelby Clark, then CEO of RelayRides. That company would rebrand itself as Turo in 2015, four years after Haddad took over the company.<\/p>\n<p>Turo is a platform that enables car owners to rent out their ride when it is not in use. Anything from a Corolla to Corvette or Model T to Tesla is available, almost always at prices cheaper than rental cars. If someone\u00a0needed to quickly\u00a0pitch Turo in an elevator, they might say it\u2019s an Airbnb for cars.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI loved what Shelby was thinking about and I loved the mission of the company, which hasn&#8217;t changed. It\u2019s always been about transforming a car into an asset when an owner not using it,\u201d says Haddad.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI could see how that idea could be incredibly powerful\u2014I saw it at eBay and iBazar, turning stuff in people\u2019s attics into something valuable.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to be convinced, but it\u2019s another thing to turn that conviction into reality. That process has been Haddad\u2019s journey for the past six years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne thing I love about these platform businesses is that they\u2019re fundamentally based on optimistic principles that people are great,\u201d Haddad explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a vote of confidence in human nature and the ability for us to be entrepreneurial and scrappy, and to find different ways to create economic empowerment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-99442\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/12-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"12\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/12-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/12-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/12-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/12-1280x720.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/12.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In terms of economic empowerment, there\u2019s almost no better way then to repurpose cars. North America is home to 330 million cars and by 2030 there will be two billion cars in the world. According to data from AAA, Americans spend one out of every 30 minutes in their car a year\u2014so why not use the other 29 minutes making money?<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to\u00a0working on Turo, it helps that Haddad is a pretty big car junkie. He won\u2019t\u00a0say how many cars he owns, but gladly shows the three cars he owns that are available to rent on Turo\u2013an Audi R8, a Porsche 911 and a Tesla Model X.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTuro is a perfect intersection for me. From a business standpoint, it\u2019s something I\u2019m familiar with, as well as passionate about the model and platform, combined with something I care deeply about\u2014cars,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Haddad isn\u2019t one of <em>those<\/em> car owners though\u2014the ones who keep people an arms-length away from their\u00a0prized possession at all times. His Porsche was the 259th car listed on Turo, proving he wants others to have as much fun with it as he does.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get people excited about driving cars again, instead of the utilitarian and commuter approach,\u201d says Haddad. \u201cWe offer professional photography to all our hosts, so it\u2019s a real pleasure seeing these cars in beautiful settings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still though, try as Haddad may when it comes to making cars into beautiful objects, they are still just a product.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the car, it\u2019s about connecting people. If we can establish a framework that makes a human connection and they feel like they&#8217;re actually hosting a car, we can bring out the best in people,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Turo started as a hardware-based model, where renters never met with owners and simply picked up keys left in a box in the car, \u201cbut that approach was something people were not comfortable with,\u201d says Haddad. Now a user introduces themselves before renting, telling a story of why they want that car. Maybe it\u2019s a birthday party or just a method of cruising around a new city.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-99457\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Andre-Haddad-1.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Haddad\" width=\"750\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Andre-Haddad-1.jpg 750w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13095821\/Andre-Haddad-1-300x162.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even as Haddad\u2019s views on Turo remain more about people and less about cars, it\u2019s hard to ignore the imminent and impersonal nature of automation that is shaking the industry. Haddad doesn&#8217;t perceive this\u00a0as a death sentence for cars or driving\u2014\u201cit&#8217;s not a black and white issue,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAutomation will win in the use-cases where it provides superior experience and value, but driving yourself and taking part in the travel experience will thrive,\u201d says Haddad. \u201cThe road trip will live on.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe more automation grows, the more there will be a need for human connection.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Haddad is savvy\u2014he knows the great things a connected or autonomous car can do. But his emphasis lies more towards the social connections technology can bring, despite the rise of trends pointing to the decline of humans driving cars. Haddad thinks that these futuristic trends will only lead to more P2P car-sharing.<\/p>\n<p>Renters are much more likely to list their car on Turo if there\u2019s a connectivity element involved, as it\u2019s easier to remotely unlock a door with an app in case someone forgets a key inside or check mileage. Electric cars owners also more likely to list rides, as they have less maintenance and wear-and-tear. These are two examples of new car technologies that are only increasing the presence of vehicles on Turo.<\/p>\n<p>As the conversation shifts from automation to companies that employ these new technologies, like Uber or car producers, Haddad\u2019s eyes light up at the mention of Turo\u2019s competition, because the question goes so deep. It gets split into two ideas: supply and demand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to think about two competitive sets. The biggest competitor for us when it comes to potential hosts is a lack of awareness that your car can be monetized. Secondly is vanquishing that initial sense of \u2018is this a real thing,\u2019 or \u2018is this safe,\u2019\u201d says Haddad.<\/p>\n<p>Companies like Airbnb had a basis for rents to go off\u2014they\u00a0saw vacation homes rented safely years before Airbnb was a thing. Uber drivers had the taxi or limo industry to look at. Turo hardly had anything for potential suppliers of cars to look towards.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe are truly pioneering something that has never been done before. We have to work extra hard to make people feel comfortable that this is actually okay to do, and it\u2019s not something weird,\u201d he says.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On the demand side, the picture is broad. There are buses, Uber, taxis, rental cars, buying a car. It\u2019s hard to quantify.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people use Turo for so many different things, it\u2019s hard to tell you there\u2019s one set of competitors. The average rental is four days, but it hides a bunch of use cases,\u201d explains Haddad. \u201cPeople might book for a day, or book for months. For each use case, there\u2019s almost a unique alternative.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Aside from trying to figure out how people get around, there\u2019s the question of why. Maybe someone uses Turo as an extended test drive before buying a Tesla, or maybe it&#8217;s to rent a convertible that will drive up and down the California coast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome cases, there\u2019s no competition. Others, there\u2019s a lot,\u201d describes Haddad. Still, there are some focus points.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe traveller market certainly is the bigger market. But how we focus on it is by delivering a great customer experience that will make people so happy about their experience that they need to talk about it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Turo is such a new thing, it\u2019s challenging to try and target people\u2014you want to just make sure you can leverage your user base and make them a promoter of the brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Haddad lives and breathes that notion of customer experience above all\u2014and his unanimous five-star reviews on Turo only cements it. Just keep an eye out the next time you rent a Porsche. You may just meet the CEO himself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Andre Haddad is a master when it comes to connecting a person with what they need.
