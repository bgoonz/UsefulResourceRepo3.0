The new readers will also work with a brand new  OMNY Card, which will replace the Metrocard. The MTA plans to begin the rollout of a reduced-fare version of the OMNY Card this year and aims to completely phase out the Metrocard by 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/13094855\/digital-nyc-contactless1-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-120657\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/13094855\/digital-nyc-contactless1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/13094855\/digital-nyc-contactless1-730x486.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/13094855\/digital-nyc-contactless1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/13094855\/digital-nyc-contactless1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/01\/13094855\/digital-nyc-contactless1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The MTA&#8217;s new payment systems.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MTA first launched OMNY in May 2019 and had planned to finish the implementation of the system by October 2020, but experienced delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Since its launch, the system has seen approximately 34 million swipes. The final OMNY tap-and-go readers, installed at the end of the month, were installed at the last subway stop in Brooklyn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Everything that Metrocard does today, OMNY will do in the future, but better,&#8221; OMNY executive director Al Putre said in an interview last month, adding that the cards will be available at major retailers \u2014&nbsp;such as drugstores, just as the Metrocard is. Putre added that the MTA will continue to accept cash, but is hoping users will migrate towards contactless payment options instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contactless payment has spiked in popularity over the last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
