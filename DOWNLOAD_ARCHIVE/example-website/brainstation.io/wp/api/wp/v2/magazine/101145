But with the startup\u2019s software, nurses at Bayshore HealthCare can tap into a patient\u2019s entire health record in real-time, something that telemedicine services don\u2019t typically have access to.<\/p>\n<p>MedChart\u2019s portal lets\u00a0nurses see a patient\u2019s complete medical chart, make informed clinical decisions, and ultimately determine if they need to visit an emergency room.<\/p>\n<p>In Ontario, roughly 60,000 cancer patients are currently receiving systemic therapy, including chemotherapy, the most common form of systemic cancer treatment. Nearly 50 per cent of those patients will experience treatment-related side effects, often resulting in unnecessary visits to the emergency department, according to Cancer Care Ontario.\u00a0The organization calculates the\u00a0annual impact of these potentially avoidable emergency department visits to about $7.5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Bateman said\u00a0CAREChart@Home is hoping to relieve some of the burden on the healthcare system while also helping cancer patients avoid waiting in\u00a0emergency rooms for hours only to be told they are fine.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese hospitals can easily connect their health information systems to MedChart, and now patients have ownership of their data and can provide it to telemedicine after-hour nurses,\u201d said Bateman. \u201cIf they have to go to emerge, patients can go with their complete medical history in hand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The startup has been working with Southlake Regional Health Centre since May 2017 and currently has eight hospitals apart of its network.\u00a0To date, 1,700 unique healthcare providers and institutions have released 23,500 records to MedChart with patient permission.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new MedChart\u00a0partnership will empower Ontario cancer patients to receive after-hours care without visiting an emergency room.
