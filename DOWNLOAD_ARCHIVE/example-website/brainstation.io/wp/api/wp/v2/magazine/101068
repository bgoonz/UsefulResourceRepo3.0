Making the plan easy to understand was a priority for Planswell CEO Eric Arnold.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that basically no one knows what they need to do on a monthly basis to maintain their lifestyle in retirement,\u201d said Arnold in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to ensure that everyone has the same opportunity to secure their financial future, regardless of their current status.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The online plan shows people how to maximize their investment potential, minimize their borrowing costs and financially protect themselves. From there, Canadians can either follow the free plan\u00a0on their own or tap Planswell to guide them through each step for a fee.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOver 100,000 financial advisors across Canada will tell you that their ideal client has $1 million or more in investable assets. That\u2019s just under 1 percent of the population,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cThe other 99 per cent have been completely ignored, or worse, have been targets of predatory, high-fee products in the absence of a plan. We\u2019re finding we can save Canadians hundreds of thousands of dollars towards their retirements through better planning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s free online financial planning solution gained the attention from a range of investors as Planswell also announced the startup secured a $6.8-million seed round. Some of that funding came from former senior executives from some of Canada\u2019s top financial institutions, according to\u00a0the company.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re using our seed capital to continually enhance our financial planning software and to provide free financial plans to Canadians across the country,\u201d said\u00a0Arnold.<\/p>\n<p>The fintech startup can also help people invest their money through Planswell Portfolios, an operating name of Higgins Investment Group, a registered portfolio manager in B.C., Alberta and Ontario.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Toronto\u2019s Planswell is lifting the startup\u2019s waitlist for its online financial planning engine, opening up its software Canada-wide and revealing $6.8 million\u00a0in new funding.
