As a result, they are often able to bring solutions to market faster than a large global bank with numerous competing technology investment demands. And when partnerships are pursued that are targeted and relevant, they can help a bank adapt\u2014and grow\u2014to meet clients\u2019 changing needs,\u201d wrote Allyson Laurance, Citi&#8217;s global partnerships head, Treasury and Trade Solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to collaborating with emerging fintech companies, Citi has invested in its digital strategy in other ways.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the popular banking group unveiled a <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/04\/citi-unveils-new-ai-powered-intelligent-virtual-agents\">new AI-powered intelligent virtual agent <\/a>(IVA) that operates as a new customer service solution. The IVA can \u201cunderstand languages, accents, and dialects, and can understand the intent of the call by making sense of the customer\u2019s word choice.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/05\/14\/citibank-expands-digital-banking-onboarding-to-37-countries\">Citibank expanded digital banking capabilities to 37 countries worldwide<\/a>.
