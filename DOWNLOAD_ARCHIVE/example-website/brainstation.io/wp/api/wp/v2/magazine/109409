The real distinction, and perhaps the true indicator of long-term success, is how that company is able to rebound from the hurdles it encounters through its early growth stages.<\/p>\n<p>Clearbanc found their way, but it wasn&#8217;t easy. Founded in 2015, the startup has been on a tear over the last six months after having to pivot business ideas two times within the past four years. Co-founded by Andrew D\u2019Souza and Michele Romanow\u2014who\u00a0are now CEO and president respectively\u2014Clearbanc has jumped around a bit in terms of focus. They seem to have landed on a solid business plan in the last 18\u00a0months\u00a0as the company raised two separate funding rounds within a month of each other totaling $120 million.<\/p>\n<p>Romanow\u2019s name <a href=\"https:\/\/borndigital.com\/2017\/07\/19\/vanguards-michele-romanow\" target=\"_blank\">probably sounds seem familiar<\/a>. As a serial entrepreneur, Romanow has built companies like Buytopia and SnapSaves, selling the latter to Groupon in 2014 after building its valuation up to over $25 million in under a year. A member of the 2019 Canadian Top 40 Under 40 list, Romanow is also a Dragon on CBC\u2019s Dragons\u2019 Den, a show where she was able to invest in explosive startups like Endy.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109443\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-104.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109415\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109415\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-109415 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-10.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clearbanc&#8217;s main boardroom.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109444\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102-768x511.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102-1280x852.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-102.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The exposure\u00a0to rapidly-growing companies that Dragons&#8217; Den offered allowed Romanow and D\u2019Souza to recognize startup success stories, but it took a bit of shuffling around first. The company found its legs by funding Uber drivers and offering them cash advance payday loans. That idea landed Clearbanc in Y Combinator but lost steam quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Around early 2017, Clearbanc turned to funding Airbnb hosts, providing them cash to buy new properties, furniture, and anything else they would need to earn new customers. That went great until regulations came down and scared off almost every Airbnb user from making formal agreements with the company. The Clearbanc team was forced to pivot once more.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, another co-founder and current VP of product Tanay Delima had been working with e-commerce companies on the side. The whole team realized that they could create a better solution for companies selling products online to scale. Instead of giving up equity and board seats to investors, they could engage in corporate revenue sharing, the technical name for what Clearbanc does now.<\/p>\n<p>Growing a company is tough work, and Clearbanc created the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.20mintermsheet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">20-minute term sheet<\/a> to address that challenge. Clearbanc invests between $10,000 to $10 million in companies with positive advertising spending, as long as Clearbanc\u2019s algorithm has reviewed and verified the company\u2019s revenue data. The company\u00a0must then pay back 106 per cent of Clearbanc\u2019s investment, plus a share of revenue each month until that investment is paid back.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Clearbanc has set a goal to invest $1 billion in non-dilutive capital before the end of 2019.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There is a heavy reliance on direct to consumer brands when it comes to companies Clearbanc funds\u2014about 70 per cent. Another 20 per cent comes from online retailers who buy in bulk. Clearbanc has found themselves a niche as well with subscription boxes, finding them to be a great growth segment and easy to track in terms of success. Clearbanc is currently looking into B2B SaaS, mobile apps, and people who are just starting out with their online business as well.<\/p>\n<p>One particular example of a unique Clearbanc customer is a candle company that launched on a Thursday and had $15,000 in sales by the following Wednesday. This is the kind of company investors would never touch, but they needed money to scale quickly, and Clearbanc was right there to give it to them.<\/p>\n<p>With a business model like that, things are going well so far. Currently sitting around 100 total employees, Clearbanc\u2019s office is spread between two floors and reaching close to 15,000 square feet. Expansion has been incredibly rapid\u201420 new employees are in the process of on-boarding, while another 37 will join in August, bringing the total to over 150 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109417\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-14.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109423\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-25.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109413\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109413\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-109413 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-8.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109413\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The values every Clearbanc employee lives by.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Clearbanc trains its staff in a unique way through something they call Founder School, the brainchild of D\u2019Souza.

True GoT fans will know.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>One of the most interesting aspects of Clearbanc\u2019s working culture comes from the energy every employee comes into contact with while chatting with e-commerce entrepreneurs. Inspiration is contagious, so Clearbanc knows that if their employees leave the company, it\u2019s typically to start their own business. Clearbanc recognizes this, so if an employee does leave the company, they\u2019ll try to work with them to fund their new startup and get them on their way. Clearbanc considers it a badge of honor if their employees leave to start businesses and enlist their help to scale.<\/p>\n<p>The work culture at Clearbanc is reminiscent of many high-growth startups: A mix of\u00a0intense\u00a0energy and careful strategy. The engineers, operations team, and others occupy the top floor, while the sales team has its own floor down below. Growth has been so rapid that the sales floor is almost completely bare, save for workstations. Clearbanc needed room to expand and heard from another tenant that office space\u00a0freed up, and within a week, Clearbanc was in. They knocked down meeting rooms to create more open space, and the minimalist exposed design captures the company\u2019s meteoric success well.<\/p>\n<p>The sales floor has a lot of the sales\u00a0paraphernalia necessary to fit the mold, from a putting green and basketball net to a golden sledgehammer and championship belt. One employee&#8217;s desk also boasts two Union Jacks\u00a0as he is responsible for working on Clearbanc&#8217;s U.K accounts.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109458\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24-1024x632.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24\" width=\"1024\" height=\"632\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24-1024x632.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24-768x474.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24-1280x789.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-24.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109442\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-1024x688.jpg\" alt=\"clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces\" width=\"1024\" height=\"688\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-300x202.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-768x516.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces-1280x860.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095117\/clearbanc-techvibes-killer-spaces.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109422\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109422\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-109422 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-23.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109422\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Alec says ABC: Always Be Clearbanc-ing.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109424\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-26.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Clearbanc\u00a0has a few remote employees in\u00a0New York City and San Francisco who work closely with the local venture firms.

Snacks provide sustenance for the Clearbanc crew, though there may be an abundance of keto-friendly eats, as D\u2019Souza and Romanow are both advocates of the diet.<\/p>\n<p>Twice a year, the company goes on a retreat to a former nunnery near Buffalo. The staff all align on values and plan goals for the next six months, focusing on the pillars they need to achieve in order to scale and find new talent. They also know how to have a good time inside the office. In early June, the\u00a0Toronto Raptors championship parade marched right under Clearbanc, flooding the street with millions of fans. To celebrate, the company invited an investor of theirs, iNovia Capital, to bask in the\u00a0historic day. The VC\u2019s partners showed up\u00a0with\u00a0supplies of champagne, ready to\u00a0toast the city\u2019s flagship basketball team and celebrate with their fast-growing portfolio member. Talk about a fun day at the office.<\/p>\n<p>Growth and success create good problems, and as a company that is constantly expanding, Clearbanc is already looking for a new location. Ideally, they want the whole company to be together on one floor, allowing the sales team to chat with marketing and operations and streamline onboarding for clients. They actually expect to outgrow this office\u00a0by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109411\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109411\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-109411 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095342\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-4.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109411\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos from Clearbanc&#8217;s most recent company retreat.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-109418\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095340\/techvibes-killer-spaces-clearbanc-15.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109451\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109451\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-109451 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/michele-romanow-killer-spaces-techvibes-1-1024x856.jpg\" alt=\"michele-romanow-killer-spaces-techvibes-(1)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"856\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/michele-romanow-killer-spaces-techvibes-1-1024x856.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/michele-romanow-killer-spaces-techvibes-1-300x251.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/michele-romanow-killer-spaces-techvibes-1-768x642.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2019\/07\/13095116\/michele-romanow-killer-spaces-techvibes-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109451\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Romanow looking over the recent Toronto Raptors championship parade from the Clearbanc office.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><em>Do you have an amazing office and would like to be featured here?
