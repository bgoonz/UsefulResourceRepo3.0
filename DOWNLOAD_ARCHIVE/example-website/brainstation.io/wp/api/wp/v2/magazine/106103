It might mean standing up for what you believe in, or sticking with the best option because it&#8217;s what works for you.<\/p>\n<p>To Craig Underwood, Sam Duboc and Rob Gierkink, loyalty meant giving something back to consumers who found a favourite retailer and stuck with it. It meant giving someone a little something back for forming a routine. So those young entrepreneurs jammed desks together in a small Toronto hotel room,\u00a0gathered around a single computer, and founded Loyalty Management Group Canada back in 1991.<\/p>\n<p>Those three wanted to ditch the then-typical loyalty experience that was tied to a single retailer, so they brainstormed. The idea for multi-retailer loyalty came to them and it quickly took off\u2014literally. In 1992, the company launched Air Miles, entering the daily lexicon of Canadians across the country as two million users picked up the program in its first six months.<\/p>\n<p>Loyalty Management Group Canada caught the attention of Alliance Data, who acquired the Toronto company in 1998 and switched the name to Alliance Data Loyalty Services. The three founders eventually parted ways with the company, and as the company began to grow, it developed a distinct focus on three key capabilities: coalition loyalty, customer analytics and custom loyalty services. To better focus on those, the platform rebranded as LoyaltyOne Co. in 2008.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-106117\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-2.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-2\" width=\"1550\" height=\"1033\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-2.jpg 1550w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-2-1280x853.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1550px) 100vw, 1550px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bryan Pearson took over as president and CEO in 2007. Now at 1,500 employees strong around the world, LoyaltyOne is the global leader when it comes to designing and implementing loyalty programs and services. The company operates some of the leading customer-centric solutions in the world, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.precima.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Precima<\/a>, their global retail strategy and analytics arm; the Netherlands-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandloyalty-int.com\/en-GB\/home\/\" target=\"_blank\">BrandLoyalty<\/a>; and a working partnership with Latin America&#8217;s leading coalition program, <a href=\"http:\/\/dotz\" target=\"_blank\">dotz<\/a>. Oh, and Air Miles, of course.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of what\u2019s happening at home in North America, all you have to do is think of the stores you visit every week. There\u2019s a good chance they have all worked with LoyaltyOne, including the LCBO, Cineplex, Shell, Coca-Cola, Loblaw and Unilever.\u00a0Whoever said loyalty points don&#8217;t go as far nowadays?<\/p>\n<h3>Work<\/h3>\n<p>LoyaltyOne moved offices in August 2017 into a new build and spared no expense to give their employees the office of the future. Gensler designed the 200,000 square-foot space to combine innovation, collaboration and culture into one functional workspace. The office was not a typical design job either\u2014to get the best results, LoyaltyOne interviewed employees, performed camera journalling, held focus groups, analyzed high activity areas and more, finally settling on an activity-based workspace with a 1:1.25 sharing space ratio.<\/p>\n<p>The workplace attitude is fuelled by four guiding principles. First is to plan for a variety of experiences, as employees thrive on choice, balance and focus. That could mean taking a phone call in an isolated booth, heading to a shared meeting room to dissect it, then taking in a company-wide event in the atrium.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106142\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-30\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-730x487.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-1460x974.jpg 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095527\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-30.jpg 1549w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106127\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-12-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-12\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-12-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-12-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-12-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-12-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-12.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Second is to support a tech-savvy culture, which means state-of-the-art communications throughout the office.

On any day you can find vegan, low sodium, and gluten-free options, and all meat is certified halal.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, every office runs on good coffee, and LoyaltyOne is no stranger to the good stuff. Their on-site Taddle Creek Coffee Co. barista bar is named after a creek that used to run through\u00a0the area and has its own brand of beans (created with the help of local roasters Propeller) to please both the early-morning sippers and mid-afternoon energy-seekers.

The President\u2019s Circle Award is another intra-office recognition program that rewards excellent workers with an all-expenses-paid weekend trip along with four extra vacation days and more.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106124\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-9-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-9\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-9-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-9-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-9-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-9.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106122\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-7-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-7\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-7-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-7-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-7.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106136\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-22-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-22\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-22-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-22-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-22-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-22.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Fun<\/h3>\n<p>If the working culture wasn&#8217;t engaging enough, LoyaltyOne knows how to throw down as well\u2014as partiers and community activists. The team runs the Marathon of Sport, walks dogs, plants trees, and continually supports their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loyalty.com\/content\/good-food-machine\" target=\"_blank\">Good Food Machine<\/a>, a program that teaches students to adopt healthier habits into their lives. Add on employee-led committees like the Women\u2019s Leadership Initiative and the Working Parent\u2019s Group, and workers at LoyaltyOne can rest knowing they\u2019ve made a difference in the world.<\/p>\n<p>But sometimes rest is overrated, so LoyaltyOne looks out for those who want to let their hair down as well. Their town halls often feature industry-leaders such as Chris Hadfield and their company fun days include concerts from the likes of The Arkells. Every other Friday, the beer and wine taps provide liquid joy as\u00a0teams get together to blow off steam. Recently, the company held a music festival-themed bash, bringing in food truck food and giving away 40 concert tickets to employees.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106130\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-16-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-16\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-16-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-16-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095530\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-16.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106140\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-28-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-28\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-28-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-28-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-28-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-28-1280x853.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-28.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_106115\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-106115\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-106115 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-24-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-24\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-24-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-24-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-24-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095532\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-24.jpg 1549w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-106115\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Everyday I&#8217;m shufflin&#8217;.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-106137\" src=\"https:\/\/localhost:8080\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-23-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"LoyaltyOne Office - Killer Spaces-23\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-23-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-23-1280x854.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2018\/06\/13095528\/LoyaltyOne-Office-Killer-Spaces-23.jpg 1549w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Do you have an amazing office and would like to be featured here?
