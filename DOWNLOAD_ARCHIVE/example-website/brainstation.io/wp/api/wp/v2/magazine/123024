Shoppers and Canada Life will give patients remote access to pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians. Health Solutions by Shoppers helps employers and their benefits providers\u2014like Canada Life\u2014deliver health benefits, with the ultimate goal of improving employee well-being and health outcomes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At Canada Life, we&#8217;re always on the lookout for programs and initiatives that support the financial, physical and mental well-being of Canadians,&#8221; says&nbsp;Ryan Weiss, vice president of product and experience for group customer, Canada Life. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The health coaching program evolved from a successful diabetes management coaching and medication counselling program that we launched together with Shoppers Drug Mart in 2013. By expanding that early program, we aim to build on that earlier success by tackling some known care gaps and empowering plan members to better manage their health.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbara Carnegie, vice president of Payor Partnerships at Shoppers Drug Mart, said that the new program&#8217;s goal is &#8220;providing the tools they need to successfully manage their overall health.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Now more than ever, Canadians need convenient access to resources that help them navigate their health challenges,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Through participating employers, our&nbsp;pharmacists, nurses, and dieticians from our health coaching team can provide the support required to help employees and their dependents both prevent and manage their conditions more effectively.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada Life has been boosting its telehealth offerings throughout the pandemic, having earlier <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/03\/09\/canada-life-and-dialogue-partner-for-virtual-telehealth\" target=\"_blank\">partnered<\/a> with Montreal-based Dialogue Technologies to offer virtual healthcare solutions to clients, shortly after <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/28\/canada-life-onboards-league-to-integrate-flexible-benefits\" target=\"_blank\">onboarding<\/a> virtual healthcare giant League.
