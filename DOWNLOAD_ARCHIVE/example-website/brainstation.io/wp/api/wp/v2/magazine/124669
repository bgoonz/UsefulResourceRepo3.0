In this case, success is two-fold. Not only do consumers have a more streamlined, digital-first approach to listing and selling their car, but they actually typically end up getting more for their vehicle compared to traditional means.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motorway works like this: a customer uploads details of their used car via a Motorway app. Then, the app uses AI and enhanced computer vision to virtually assess the state of the car.&nbsp; Once the car has been assessed and verified, it is listed in a daily auction to more than 3,000 used car dealers, all of which individually bid on it. The highest offer wins the car, and then it is collected for free by the dealer within 24 hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"671\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16131647\/sellerApp.58843b8b82adfe5e705c4a5d854f6dc4-1024x671.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-124695\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16131647\/sellerApp.58843b8b82adfe5e705c4a5d854f6dc4-1024x671.png 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16131647\/sellerApp.58843b8b82adfe5e705c4a5d854f6dc4-730x478.png 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16131647\/sellerApp.58843b8b82adfe5e705c4a5d854f6dc4-768x503.png 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16131647\/sellerApp.58843b8b82adfe5e705c4a5d854f6dc4-300x196.png 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/07\/16131647\/sellerApp.58843b8b82adfe5e705c4a5d854f6dc4.png 1371w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Over 90% of cars are sold within 24 hours of being listed on Motorway.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, a car can go from listed in auction to off a driveway in under a day, and it\u2019s all completely free for the seller. Over 90% of cars are sold within 24 hours of being listed on Motorway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBy cutting out the dealer and moving the whole process online, we get a much better deal for both sides, without the hassle and with a much better experience,\u201d says Leathes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motorway\u2019s seamless auction-based platform also makes the experience for the seller much smoother. It removes every instance of high-pressure in-person situations, where a seller may not fully understand the value of their car before trading it in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a benefit for the dealers themselves. Motorway\u2019s platform improves the overall infrastructure around used car markets, connecting dealers to the absolute best stock of used cars to then offer to their own customer bases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one in the middle, and that ensures the dealers always get the best price,\u201d explained Leathes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Motorway&#8217;s impressive growth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The model is obviously working, as Motorway recently secured a massive \u00a348 million funding round. As the pandemic drove every type of commerce online, Motorway has seen an exponential rise in the need for its services. The company saw sales top \u00a350 million in May 2021 alone, and is currently hitting around \u00a32.5 million of transactions per day and 4,000 car sales each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a lot of room for Motorway to grow. In the U.K., the used car market sits at around \u00a360 billion per year. Since the start of 2021, Motorway reported that average transaction prices for cars listed on its site have risen 8.2%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to North America, Carvana, the second-largest used car marketplace in the U.S. (which is also online-only) sold 37% more cars in its most recent reported quarter. Clearly, there is a rising demand for used cars across the world, and Motorway is intent on scaling up to grab it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt has been a crazy year for the used car industry,\u201d says Leathes. \u201cEver since the pandemic, there has been this shift for people to buy a car. There are lots of reasons for that: people are avoiding using public transport, and there&#8217;s a shortage of new cars, so this has led to a very buoyant used car market and a renaissance for that market.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BMW&#8217;s interest in Motorway<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more interesting aspects of Motorway\u2019s growth is a key investor behind its recent funding round. BMW\u2019s venture fund arm, BMW i Ventures, took a stake in Motorway, obviously believing in the power of bringing a digital edge to a used car market ripe for disruption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith Motorway, we have invested in a company that has created an innovative way for car owners to sell their vehicles by connecting consumers to car dealers directly,\u201d said Kasper Sage, partner at BMW i Ventures. \u201dTheir platform marks the start of a new era in used car retail by making the selling process simpler, faster, and hassle-free \u2013 and by delivering both a superior experience and a better deal for both parties.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motorway is set to expand: it will build the \u201cmost advanced platform for used car transactions,\u201d according to Leathes, and in order to do so, the company will grow from its current size of 160 to about 200 by the end of 2021. The company is currently looking for all kinds of engineering, marketing, and sales roles at its London office.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just 5% of all vehicles in the UK are sold online, even though pre-COVID, 43% of auto shoppers wanted to do their entire transaction online without ever visiting an auto dealer.\u00a0 Buying and selling used cars is deeply annoying as it generally entails excessive market research, a myriad of nontransparent negotiations, and lowball offers.&nbsp; But &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/magazine\/motorways-mission-to-optimize-online-used-car-sales\">Continued<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":76244,"featured_media":124696,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":[],"categories":[13],"tags":[],"magazine-series":[3161],"magazine-region":[3681],"magazine-topic":[3674,3679],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine\/124669"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/types\/magazine"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/users\/76244"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine\/124669\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":125115,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine\/124669\/revisions\/125115"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/media\/124696"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=124669"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=124669"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=124669"},{"taxonomy":"magazine-series","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine-series?post=124669"},{"taxonomy":"magazine-region","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine-region?post=124669"},{"taxonomy":"magazine-topic","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/wp\/api\/wp\/v2\/magazine-topic?post=124669"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
