Taylor and his team lean hard on data-based decision making as well as data-sharing with their partners to build a mobile gaming juggernaut in Vancouver&#8217;s Coal Harbour neighborhood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cInstead of watching international companies come in and gobble up Canadian talent and build studio powerhouses, [we thought] there was no reason why we couldn\u2019t build a gaming powerhouse out of Canada that could compete on a global level,\u201d Taylor says. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of building up that powerhouse is giving its gaming partners the power to develop products on their own terms, armed with data from the parent company Leaf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1460\" height=\"1079\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/10\/05120531\/The-Ofice-App-BrainStation-Magazine-3-1460x1079.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-125694\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/10\/05120531\/The-Ofice-App-BrainStation-Magazine-3-1460x1079.jpg 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/10\/05120531\/The-Ofice-App-BrainStation-Magazine-3-730x539.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/10\/05120531\/The-Ofice-App-BrainStation-Magazine-3-768x568.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/10\/05120531\/The-Ofice-App-BrainStation-Magazine-3-1536x1135.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2021\/10\/05120531\/The-Ofice-App-BrainStation-Magazine-3.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1460px) 100vw, 1460px\" \/><figcaption>Last month LEAF announced its newest title <em>The Office: Somehow We Manage<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re there to provide value-add services that allow them to focus on their business,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cOur view is that the game development world is a mix of science and art, with a heavy overlay of culture. So it&#8217;s not about us trying to make one homogeneous culture. It&#8217;s about a mix of great leaders, great entrepreneurs, great game builders, great storytellers, who really want to share their knowledge across the group.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h3 has-text-align-left\"><h3 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">Digital Inclusivity<\/h3><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaf\u2019s primary product focus is on IP-driven games, but also on an audience that is both highly engaged <em>and <\/em>underserved.

Third-party developers using Idle Kit are able to bring fully optimized, easily monetized games to market faster \u2014 and with a higher likelihood of success \u2014&nbsp;than their competitors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe help de-risk development,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cStudios do art design and gameplay very well, and what we provide is a framework that does the science, on the back end.\u201d The science, as Taylor calls it, is everything from live ops and events management to analytics and API tools, allowing developers to \u201cincrease the surface area of their success.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, Leaf has access to large, rich datasets from its various gaming partners, which the company then feeds into its analytics tool and provides back to its partners, allowing them to further optimize their game operations and decision-making process. The whole thing, in short, is a fine-tuned, data-driven machine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading bstn-blocks-heading--h3 has-text-align-left\"><h3 class=\"bstn-blocks-heading__heading-element\">Data makes the difference<\/h3><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>With more data and a large portfolio of games, Leaf is able to take a holistic approach to their marketing, and make increasingly data-driven decisions relating to how they reach, acquire, and attain new players. Leaf is able to provide gaming entrepreneurs with a hugely diverse set of data points to help them achieve their product goals, in addition to access to other gaming entrepreneurs already operating under Leaf\u2019s umbrella: \u201cThey get to talk to like-minded people who&#8217;ve either gone down those paths, or have some life experience, and it&#8217;s a tremendous value to all parties within the group,\u201d Taylor says.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the team at Leaf is constantly at work analyzing user gameplay to develop best practices for its partners and developers, Taylor is reluctant to divulge too much information as to what, exactly, this analysis looks like. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give away the special sauce,\u201d he laughs. He will divulge that the team conducts frequent A\/B tests to learn about player reactions and habits and to determine what types of gaming elements or incentives drive loyalty. \u201cThen, we basically disseminate that knowledge and those toolsets across our studio partners, as well as across our Idle Kit partners,\u201d he says \u2014 not unlike what a SaaS model.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leaf prepares to continue developing new games such as Rupaul&#8217;s Drag Race, it is doing so off the back of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/leafmobile.io\/news-release-leaf-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-may-17-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\">a Q1 that saw whopping 95% year-over-year revenue growth<\/a>.&nbsp;Taylor says Leaf is just getting started, and he\u2019s excited to continue building the gaming industry within Vancouver in particular, and Canada in general. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe think Canada, and Vancouver in particular, is a talent hotbed for gaming companies, as well as people in gaming,\u201d he says. \u201cOur view is that going forward, we will be a global player in this space while flying that Canadian flag.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Something interesting happened in mobile gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014&nbsp;at least if you ask Darcy Taylor.
