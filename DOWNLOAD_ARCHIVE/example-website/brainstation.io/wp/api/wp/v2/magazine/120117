A quick search is all it takes to video chat with a doctor, create a detailed nutrition plan, discover the best ways to manage stress, or access a plethora of health and wellness information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With seemingly infinite options, users have to make a choice, which is usually a good thing. But in the world of healthcare, choice can actually create barriers. Different tools, platforms, and services are each tied to their respective companies and organizations. These tools may be great at addressing a specific problem or challenge but rarely do they connect to a holistic view of a person&#8217;s healthcare. If a digital service can only solve one aspect of health, it\u2019s only marginally better than its traditional predecessor. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, digital access is a critical piece of the health puzzle, but right now exists as a collection of siloed services. It\u2019s a tough problem to solve, but Loblaw feels up to the task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We are breaking new ground here.

A logical place to start is Loblaw&#8217;s 2014 $12.4 billion (CAD) acquisition of Shopper Drug Mart, the country\u2019s largest chain of pharmacies. Since then, Loblaw has steadily increased its healthcare services with moves like in-store dieticians, a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newswire.ca\/news-releases\/shoppers-drug-mart-and-trutrace-technologies-successfully-complete-phase-1-of-the-medical-cannabis-verification-pilot-program-899840698.html\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain cannabis verification program<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/09\/16\/loblaw-expands-virtual-healthcare-with-maple-investment\">investments in telehealth startups<\/a>, and now, PC Health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"587\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-1024x587.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-120118\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-730x418.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-1460x836.jpg 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-768x440.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-1536x880.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2-300x172.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/pc-health-digital2.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>A look at the PC Health app.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While at first glance PC Health is just an app, Doug Bryce, VP of health and pharmacy programs and innovation at Shoppers Drug Mart, knows it has the potential to become a fully-fledged healthcare environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNavigating healthcare can be challenging and time-consuming,\u201d he says. \u201cThrough PC Health, we\u2019re going to empower customers to manage their health, with access to care how, where, and when they want it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce also points out that PC Health is, in his mind, unlike anything that exists in the Canadian healthcare market. They&#8217;re not here to push others out of the healthcare space, but instead bring together the parts of healthcare that work, all within one platform. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about competing with other systems\u2014quite the opposite actually,&#8221; says Bryce. &#8220;This is about helping people navigate and access public systems more efficiently. In terms of who we compare ourselves to, there really isn&#8217;t anything. There are groups and companies that do this in a particular way and fulfill one need, but because of how hard it is to do that in a country where there are provincial variations and technical challenges, no one has really tried to do this. We are breaking new ground here. It&#8217;s not just about the front door to Loblaw, but the front door to healthcare.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The PC Health basics<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of PC Health is to weave many different healthcare services together and offer incentives to ensure the healthiest possible outcomes. After downloading the app, users are taken through a 25 question onboarding flow that \u201ccreates an endless aisle of programs, content, and education for the user,\u201d according to Bryce. After they\u2019re enrolled, a number of services become available.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major differentiators touted by PC Health is free live access to caregivers. Earlier this year, Loblaw invested $75 million (CAD) into virtual healthcare startup Maple, and now the service is a core component of the platform. Today, users can chat with nurses and dieticians, and a fully-integrated platform with Maple will debut in early 2021, granting real-time access to physicians, specialists, physiotherapists, psychotherapists, social workers, and more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"652\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-1024x652.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-120119\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-1024x652.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-730x465.jpg 730w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-1460x930.jpg 1460w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-768x489.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-1536x978.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1-300x191.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/12\/13094859\/PC-Health-digital1.jpg 1550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Inside the PC Health app.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to bridge this gap between all of these siloed solutions and give people one font door where they can get access to whatever provider they need to solve their problem,\u201d says Bryce.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another service currently offered is called Health Programs. Created in partnership with League, a health benefits company that <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/02\/28\/canada-life-onboards-league-to-integrate-flexible-benefits\">works with insurance giants like Canada Life<\/a>, the programs prompt users to enroll and solve a specific health problem. It might be reducing sugar, managing stress, or getting healthier through exercise. Whatever the topic may be, League and Loblaw provide educational content that guides the user on their specific journey to get healthier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Using PC Optimum points to prompt specific daily activities that are associated with positive health outcomes is a really huge opportunity.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Doug Bryce<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Optimism for PC Optimum rewards<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guided programs aren\u2019t new by any means, but the real differentiator here rewards integration: once a user marks a daily activity as complete in the app, they receive PC Optimum points to their linked account. PC Optimum is the biggest loyalty program in Canada, with more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s adult population enrolled. Points are as good as cash and combined with goal-oriented health programs, they create a system that, while still unproven, has a chance to massively impact the Canadian digital healthcare ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPC Optimum has a really big opportunity to motivate Canadians and drive healthy behavior,\u201d says Bryce, pointing out that it could really make an impact on those with chronic diseases. \u201cWe\u2019re weaving loyalty and health together and we\u2019re still experimenting. Using PC Optimum points to prompt specific daily activities that are associated with positive health outcomes is a really huge opportunity and we\u2019re really working towards that.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s difficult to underscore the importance of rewards in an app like PC Health. There are hundreds of healthcare solutions that provide services similar to PC Health, but none of them offer points that can be redeemed for household staples as soon as they are earned. This loyalty-first concept is a huge part of Loblaw\u2019s overall roadmap to success across each of its brands.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLoyalty as a strategy is woven through the platform,\u201d says Bryce. \u201cAs customers in our network would expect, you earn points on services. So the real opportunity here is to help motivate customers to make healthier choices and manage their conditions and health goals by offering PC Optimum points.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a marketplace tied to Loblaw\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/brainstation.io\/2020\/07\/27\/loblaws-digital-sales-surge-280-passing-1-2-billion-in-2020\">billion-dollar e-commerce business<\/a> where users can browse healthy foods and goods in the app. Bryce says this will continually expand, and even begin to offer items that fit directly into tailored health programs, along with extra injections of loyalty to help prod users towards healthy choices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Wearables and integrated data<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing Bryce is careful to note is that PC health is in its infancy. He realizes there is so much to learn in the digital healthcare space, and so much room to grow, going as far as to call PC Health Loblaw\u2019s MVP in the space. But he is excited about the future, and the future means integrated data and wearables. For example, a user could walk 10,000 steps and get 500 PC Optimum points. Or they can keep a heart rate at 180 for 10 minutes and receive 250 rewards points<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;100% wearables are the future of this platform. You can imagine how you will connect a set of trackable activities and use loyalty to drive healthy activities.&#8221;<\/p><cite>Doug Bryce<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c100% that&#8217;s the future of this platform,\u201d Bryce excitedly explains. \u201cThink of simple things like wearables and step counters, then look further to different ranges of tools like connected blood pressure devices. You can imagine how you will connect a set of trackable activities and use loyalty to drive people to keep those readings within range.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s certainly a future version of PC Health coming down the line that connects directly with a Fitbit device or an Apple Watch and streams data directly into the app. A huge chunk of people are already exercising, so they may as well get rewarded for it too. This kind of thinking can drive huge loyalty to the Loblaw banner and create massive value outside of the PC Health ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPeople are now considering services through digital channels that they have not in the past,\u201d says Bryce. \u201cWhen you embed that wearable data and partner with really clinically credible associations, you can really drive outcomes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe more you get people to try them, the more they engage. There can be some real positive changes in health.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the most meaningful benefits to come from continued digital evolution is the power to access healthcare and wellness on-demand\u2013the barrier has never been lower.
