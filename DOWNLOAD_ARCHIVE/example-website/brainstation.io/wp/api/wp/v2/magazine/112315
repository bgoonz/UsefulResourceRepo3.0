The goal for Oxford was to invite new ideas to push the thinking of traditional workspaces as well as create actual units to attract tenants seeking turnkey alternatives to traditional options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four spaces, now dubbed &#8216;Districts on 10&#8217; range from 3,900-5,100 square feet and all occupy the 10th floor of the iconic 200 Bay Street tower. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The competition culminated in an awards gala that saw Connect, The Jesslin Group, and BVN take home the top prize in the form of a design contract for a 25,000 square foot space from Oxford Properties. The other teams were comprised of Gensler + DPI, Ray + The Pentacon Group, and IBI + Marant. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An eight-person judging panel, which included Digital Magazine, toured the four completed &#8216;Districts&#8217; and were scored on aesthetics, efficiency, flexibility, sustainability, wellness, and execution. Outside of the initial brief and the $125\/square foot budget, Oxford Properties remained hands-off throughout the design\/build process, allowing each team free reign to execute as they please.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one bonus for each team, and subsequent tenants, is the single common kitchen and seating area dubbed Canteen 10 which itself was designed by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Britain (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.britacan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Britacan<\/a>. Inspired in part by European shared workspaces and the popularity of co-working spaces, the new office configuration represents Oxford Properties&#8217; vision for the future of work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"745\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095028\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-Digital-Magazine-1024x745.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-112299\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095028\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-Digital-Magazine-1024x745.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095028\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-Digital-Magazine-300x218.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095028\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-Digital-Magazine-768x559.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095028\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-Digital-Magazine.jpg 1460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>The Canteen, a kitchen space shared by all four offices.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095027\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-B-Digital-Magazine-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-112310\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095027\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-B-Digital-Magazine-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095027\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-B-Digital-Magazine-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095027\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-B-Digital-Magazine-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wpassets.brainstation.io\/app\/uploads\/2020\/01\/13095027\/Oxford-WIC-Canteen-10-B-Digital-Magazine.jpg 1460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe knew we needed to experiment with the design process, because if we didn&#8217;t, we would just be doing the same old things,\u201d says John Peets, VP of office leasing at Oxford Properties. \u201cBy 2025, 75% of the global workforce will be of the millennial age. Yesterday&#8217;s way of working isn&#8217;t going to engage and excite and make people more productive, so we tapped into those organizational needs of customers to figure out how to make work exciting again.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though only one office could win, each space demonstrated unique qualities that championed environmentalism, efficiency, collaboration, and concentrative productivity. The competition resulted in four finished products indicative of a new reality in work: a rise in turnkey offices that share common areas and offer a balance between communication and contemplation. These four spaces are geared towards companies in their scale-up hyper-growth period. Potential clients can lease a beautiful office in the heart of Toronto\u2019s financial district, then move up or expand when they are ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>District 1<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design Firm: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Connect (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/connectresource.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Connect<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"BVN (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bvn.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BVN<\/strong><\/a><strong> Construction: <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The Jesslin Group (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/thejesslingroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Jesslin Group<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>District 1 focused on one trait above all: flexibility.
