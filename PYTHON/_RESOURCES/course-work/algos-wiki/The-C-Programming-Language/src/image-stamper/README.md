# Image Stamper

Write a C program that stamps images.

## Suggested runtime process

- Create 3 or more template structs with an image contained within that are created in their own separate file.
- These templates can be manually programmed, or you can load them from a file. Consider writing a C program that reads the image to be stamped and writes out C code with the data in it. This is called a _code generator_.
- Create an array of r,g,b values that is 1024x768.
- Using the templates you created in the other files, copy the templates into your large array.
- Write the array to a file according to the .PPM file specification, then convert it to .png using GIMP or another tool such as ImageMagick, below.

## Invocation

This should generate a file called outputfile.ppm with a duck, circle, turkey, and square stamped on it. (You can use whatever shapes you wish; these are merely ideas.)

```
simple_image_machine -o outputfile.ppm duck 40 100 circle 90  500 turkey 600 600 square 200 200
```

## How to attack this problem?

Start breaking it down into pieces.

- Whole program
  - Parse Command Line
  - Stamp images on main image
  - Write out final PPM image

If any of those ideas are still unclear on how to implement, break _them_ down:

- Whole Program
  - Parse Command Line
    - Get arg count from argc
    - Get args from argv
      - Write a while loop to loop over all arguments
        - look for -o, if so, get next argument and save as output file name
        - otherwise it's the name of an image followed by two numbers
          - convert number argument to int

Keep breaking it down until you get down to something that you can code up.

## ImageMagick

Install ImageMagick to help manipulate these images to get them ready to load into your program.

Mac with HomeBrew: `brew install imagemagick`

Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S imagemagick`

### Getting a plain (ASCII) PNM file

Use `convert` like so to generate an RGB image:

`convert foo.jpg -compress none foo.ppm`

Then the file will be in the format specified by the [plain PPM format specification](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html). This is an ASCII format that you might have an easier time reading in C.

If you want to read the data in binary format, use:

`convert foo.jpg foo.ppm`

and use `fread()` to read entire rows of the image into arrays at once. This is easier to code than parsing the ASCII version, but it does involve learning about reading binary data in C (not rocket science).

After you generate your final PPM image, you can convert it back to a format that's friendly to image viewers:

`convert myimage.ppm myimage.png`
