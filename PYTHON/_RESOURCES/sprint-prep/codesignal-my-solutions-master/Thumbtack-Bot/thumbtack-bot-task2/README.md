Thumbtack helps Professionals (Pros) grow their business by identifying new customers. Upon registering on Thumbtack, a Pro specifies which categories of services they provide. To help match customer requests with qualified Pros, Thumbtack maintains a list of Pros grouped by service categories.

Given a list of `pros` and their category `preferences`, return the list of Pros for each category.

**Example**

For `pros = ["Jack", "Leon", "Maria"]` and

```
preferences = [["Computer repair", "Handyman", "House cleaning"],
               ["Computer lessons", "Computer repair", "Data recovery service"],
               ["Computer lessons", "House cleaning"]]

```

the output should be

```
proCategorization(pros, preferences) = [[["Computer lessons"], ["Leon", "Maria"]],
                                        [["Computer repair"], ["Jack", "Leon"]],
                                        [["Data recovery service"], ["Leon"]],
                                        [["Handyman"], ["Jack"]],
                                        [["House cleaning"], ["Jack", "Maria"]]]

```
