Given a digital time, your task is to return a string that represents this time in regular English. The time should be rounded to the nearest multiple of `5`.

**Example**

- For `time_str = "12:00"`, the output should be `tellTime = "It's twelve o'clock"`.

- For `time_str = "08:42"`, the output should be `tellTime = "It's twenty to nine"`
