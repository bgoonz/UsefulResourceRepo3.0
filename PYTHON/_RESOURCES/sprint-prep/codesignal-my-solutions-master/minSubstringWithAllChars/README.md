## Minimum substring with all characters

You have two strings, `s` and `t`. The string `t` contains only unique elements. Find and return the minimum consecutive substring of `s` that contains all of the elements from `t`.

It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are several answers, return the one which starts from the smallest index.

###Example For `s ="adobecodebanc"` and `t = "abc"`, the output should be `minSubstringWithAllChars(s, t) = "banc"`.
