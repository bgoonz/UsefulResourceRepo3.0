# subprocess \-\-- Spawning Additional Processes

::: {.module synopsis="Spawning additional processes"} subprocess :::

Purpose

: Start and communicate with additional processes.

The `subprocess` module supports three APIs for working with processes. The `run()` function, added in Python 3.5, is a high-level API for running a process and optionally collecting its output. The functions `call()`, `check_call()`, and `check_output()` are the former high-level API, carried over from Python 2. They are still supported and widely used in existing programs. The class `Popen` is a low-level API used to build the other APIs and useful for more complex process interactions. The constructor for `Popen` takes arguments to set up the new process so the parent can communicate with it via pipes. It provides all of the functionality of the other modules and functions it replaces, and more. The API is consistent for all uses, and many of the extra steps of overhead needed (such as closing extra file descriptors and ensuring the pipes are closed) are \"built in\" instead of being handled by the application code separately.

The `subprocess` module is intended to replace functions such as `os.system()`, `os.spawnv()`, the variations of `popen()` in the `os`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} and `popen2`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} modules, as well as the `commands()` module. To make it easier to compare `subprocess` with those other modules, many of the examples in this section re-create the ones used for `os`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} and `popen2`{.interpreted-text role="mod"}.

::: {.note} ::: {.admonition-title} Note :::

The API for working on Unix and Windows is roughly the same, but the underlying implementation is different because of the difference in process models in the operating systems. All of the examples shown here were tested on Mac OS X. Behavior on a non-Unix OS may vary. :::

## Running External Command

To run an external command without interacting with it in the same way as `os.system()`, use the `run()` function.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_os_system.py :::

The command line arguments are passed as a list of strings, which avoids the need for escaping quotes or other special characters that might be interpreted by the shell. `run()` returns a `CompletedProcess` instance, with information about the process like the exit code and output.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_os_system.py

index.rst
interaction.py
repeater.py
signal_child.py
signal_parent.py

subprocess_shell_variables.py
subprocess_signal_parent_shell.py
subprocess_signal_setpgrp.py
returncode: 0
```

Setting the `shell` argument to a true value causes `subprocess` to spawn an intermediate shell process which then runs the command. The default is to run the command directly.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_shell_variables.py :::

Using an intermediate shell means that variables, glob patterns, and other special shell features in the command string are processed before the command is run.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_shell_variables.py

/Users/dhellmann
returncode: 0
```

::: {.note} ::: {.admonition-title} Note :::

Using `run()` without passing `check=True` is equivalent to using `call()`, which only returned the exit code from the process. :::

### Error Handling

The `returncode` attribute of the `CompletedProcess` is the exit code of the program. The caller is responsible for interpreting it to detect errors. If the `check` argument to `run()` is `True`, the exit code is checked and if it indicates an error happened then a `CalledProcessError` exception is raised.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_run_check.py :::

The `false` command always exits with a non-zero status code, which `run()` interprets as an error.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_run_check.py

ERROR: Command '['false']' returned non-zero exit status 1
```

::: {.note} ::: {.admonition-title} Note :::

Passing `check=True` to `run()` makes it equivalent to using `check_call()`. :::

### Capturing Output

The standard input and output channels for the process started by `run()` are bound to the parent\'s input and output. That means the calling program cannot capture the output of the command. Pass `PIPE` for the `stdout` and `stderr` arguments to capture the output for later processing.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_run_output.py :::

The `ls -1` command runs successfully, so the text it prints to standard output is captured and returned.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_run_output.py

returncode: 0
Have 522 bytes in stdout:

```

::: {.note} ::: {.admonition-title} Note :::

Passing `check=True` and setting `stdout` to `PIPE` is equivalent to using `check_output()`. :::

The next example runs a series of commands in a sub-shell. Messages are sent to standard output and standard error before the commands exit with an error code.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_run_output_error.py :::

The message to standard error is printed to the console, but the message to standard output is hidden.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_run_output_error.py

to stderr
ERROR: Command 'echo to stdout; echo to stderr 1>&2; exit 1'
returned non-zero exit status 1
```

To prevent error messages from commands run through `run()` from being written to the console, set the `stderr` parameter to the constant `PIPE`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_run_output_error_trap.py :::

This example does not set `check=True` so the output of the command is captured and printed.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_run_output_error_trap.py

returncode: 1
Have 10 bytes in stdout: 'to stdout\n'
Have 10 bytes in stderr: 'to stderr\n'
```

To capture error messages when using `check_output()`, set `stderr` to `STDOUT`, and the messages will be merged with the rest of the output from the command.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_check_output_error_trap_output.py :::

The order of output may vary, depending on how buffering is applied to the standard output stream and how much data is being printed.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_check_output_error_trap_output.py

Have 20 bytes in output: 'to stdout\nto stderr\n'
```

### Suppressing Output

For cases where the output should not be shown or captured, use `DEVNULL` to suppress an output stream. This example suppresses both the standard output and error streams.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_run_output_error_suppress.py :::

The name `DEVNULL` comes from the Unix special device file, `/dev/null`, which responds with end-of-file when opened for reading and receives but ignores any amount of input when writing.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_run_output_error_suppress.py

returncode: 1
stdout is None
stderr is None
```

## Working with Pipes Directly

The functions `run()`, `call()`, `check_call()`, and `check_output()` are wrappers around the `Popen` class. Using `Popen` directly gives more control over how the command is run, and how its input and output streams are processed. For example, by passing different arguments for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` it is possible to mimic the variations of `os.popen()`.

### One-way Communication With a Process

To run a process and read all of its output, set the `stdout` value to `PIPE` and call `communicate()`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_popen_read.py :::

This is similar to the way `popen()` works, except that the reading is managed internally by the `Popen` instance.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_popen_read.py

read:
stdout: '"to stdout"\n'
```

To set up a pipe to allow the calling program to write data to it, set `stdin` to `PIPE`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_popen_write.py :::

To send data to the standard input channel of the process one time, pass the data to `communicate()`. This is similar to using `popen()` with mode `'w'`.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 -u subprocess_popen_write.py

write:
stdin: to stdin
```

### Bi-directional Communication With a Process

To set up the `Popen` instance for reading and writing at the same time, use a combination of the previous techniques.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_popen2.py :::

This sets up the pipe to mimic `popen2()`.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 -u subprocess_popen2.py

popen2:
pass through: 'through stdin to stdout'
```

### Capturing Error Output

It is also possible watch both of the streams for `stdout` and `stderr`, as with `popen3()`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_popen3.py :::

Reading from `stderr` works the same as with `stdout`. Passing `PIPE` tells `Popen` to attach to the channel, and `communicate()` reads all of the data from it before returning.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 -u subprocess_popen3.py

popen3:
pass through: 'through stdin to stdout'
stderr      : 'to stderr\n'
```

### Combining Regular and Error Output

To direct the error output from the process to its standard output channel, use `STDOUT` for `stderr` instead of `PIPE`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_popen4.py :::

Combining the output in this way is similar to how `popen4()` works.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 -u subprocess_popen4.py

popen4:
combined output: 'through stdin to stdout\nto stderr\n'
stderr value   : None
```

## Connecting Segments of a Pipe

Multiple commands can be connected into a _pipeline_, similar to the way the Unix shell works, by creating separate `Popen` instances and chaining their inputs and outputs together. The `stdout`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute of one `Popen` instance is used as the `stdin` argument for the next in the pipeline, instead of the constant `PIPE`. The output is read from the `stdout`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} handle for the final command in the pipeline.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_pipes.py :::

The example reproduces the command line:

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ cat index.rst | grep ".. literalinclude" | cut -f 3 -d:
```

The pipeline reads the reStructuredText source file for this section and finds all of the lines that include other files, then prints the names of the files being included.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 -u subprocess_pipes.py

Included files:
subprocess_os_system.py
subprocess_shell_variables.py
subprocess_run_check.py
subprocess_run_output.py
subprocess_run_output_error.py
subprocess_run_output_error_trap.py
subprocess_check_output_error_trap_output.py
subprocess_run_output_error_suppress.py

repeater.py
interaction.py
signal_child.py
signal_parent.py
subprocess_signal_parent_shell.py
subprocess_signal_setpgrp.py
```

## Interacting with Another Command

All of the previous examples assume a limited amount of interaction. The `communicate()` method reads all of the output and waits for child process to exit before returning. It is also possible to write to and read from the individual pipe handles used by the `Popen` instance incrementally, as the program runs. A simple echo program that reads from standard input and writes to standard output illustrates this technique.

The script `repeater.py` is used as the child process in the next example. It reads from `stdin` and writes the values to `stdout`, one line at a time until there is no more input. It also writes a message to `stderr` when it starts and stops, showing the lifetime of the child process.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} repeater.py :::

The next interaction example uses the `stdin`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} and `stdout`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} file handles owned by the `Popen` instance in different ways. In the first example, a sequence of five numbers are written to `stdin`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} of the process, and after each write the next line of output is read back. In the second example, the same five numbers are written but the output is read all at once using `communicate()`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} interaction.py :::

The `"repeater.py: exiting"` lines come at different points in the output for each loop style.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 -u interaction.py

One line at a time:
repeater.py: starting
0
1
2
3
4
repeater.py: exiting


All output at once:
repeater.py: starting
repeater.py: exiting
0
1
2
3
4
```

## Signaling Between Processes

The process management examples for the `os`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module include a demonstration of signaling between processes using `os.fork()` and `os.kill()`. Since each `Popen` instance provides a _pid_ attribute with the process id of the child process, it is possible to do something similar with `subprocess`. The next example combines two scripts. This child process sets up a signal handler for the `USR` signal.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} signal_child.py :::

This script runs as the parent process. It starts `signal_child.py`, then sends the `USR1` signal.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} signal_parent.py :::

The output is:

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 signal_parent.py

PARENT      : Pausing before sending signal...
CHILD  26976: Setting up signal handler
CHILD  26976: Pausing to wait for signal
PARENT      : Signaling child
CHILD  26976: Received USR1
```

### Process Groups / Sessions {#subprocess-process-groups}

If the process created by `Popen` spawns sub-processes, those children will not receive any signals sent to the parent. That means when using the `shell` argument to `Popen` it will be difficult to cause the command started in the shell to terminate by sending `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_signal_parent_shell.py :::

The pid used to send the signal does not match the pid of the child of the shell script waiting for the signal, because in this example there are three separate processes interacting:

1.  The program `subprocess_signal_parent_shell.py`
2.  The shell process running the script created by the main python program
3.  The program `signal_child.py`

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_signal_parent_shell.py

PARENT      : Pausing before signaling 26984...
Shell script in process 26984
+ python3 signal_child.py
CHILD  26985: Setting up signal handler
CHILD  26985: Pausing to wait for signal
PARENT      : Signaling child 26984
CHILD  26985: Never received signal
```

To send signals to descendants without knowing their process id, use a _process group_ to associate the children so they can be signaled together. The process group is created with `os.setpgrp()`, which sets process group id to the process id of the current process. All child processes inherit their process group from their parent, and since it should only be set in the shell created by `Popen` and its descendants, `os.setpgrp()` should not be called in the same process where the `Popen` is created. Instead, the function is passed to `Popen` as the `preexec_fn` argument so it is run after the `fork()` inside the new process, before it uses `exec()` to run the shell. To signal the entire process group, use `os.killpg()` with the `pid`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} value from the `Popen` instance.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} subprocess_signal_setpgrp.py :::

The sequence of events is

1.  The parent program instantiates `Popen`.
2.  The `Popen` instance forks a new process.
3.  The new process runs `os.setpgrp()`.
4.  The new process runs `exec()` to start the shell.
5.  The shell runs the shell script.
6.  The shell script forks again and that process execs Python.
7.  Python runs `signal_child.py`.
8.  The parent program signals the process group using the pid of the shell.
9.  The shell and Python processes receive the signal.
10. The shell ignores the signal.
11. The Python process running `signal_child.py` invokes the signal handler.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 subprocess_signal_setpgrp.py

Calling os.setpgrp() from 75636
Process group is now 75636
PARENT      : Pausing before signaling 75636...
Shell script in process 75636
+ python3 signal_child.py
CHILD  75637: Setting up signal handler
CHILD  75637: Pausing to wait for signal
PARENT      : Signaling process group 75636
CHILD  75637: Received USR1
```
