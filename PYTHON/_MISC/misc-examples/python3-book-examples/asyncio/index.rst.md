# asyncio \-\-- Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and concurrency tools

::: {.module synopsis="Asynchronous I/O, event loop, and concurrency tools"} asyncio :::

Purpose

: An asynchronous I/O and concurrency framework.

The `asyncio` module provides tools for building concurrent applications using coroutines. While the `threading`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module implements concurrency through application threads and `multiprocessing`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} implements concurrency using system processes, `asyncio` uses a single-threaded, single-process approach in which parts of an application cooperate to switch tasks explicitly at optimal times. Most often this context switching occurs when the program would otherwise block waiting to read or write data, but `asyncio` also includes support for scheduling code to run at a specific future time, to enable one coroutine to wait for another to complete, for handling system signals, and for recognizing other events that may be reasons for an application to change what it is working on.

In Python 3.5, `asyncio` is still a _provisional_ module. The API was stablized in Python 3.6, and most of the changes were backported to later patch releases of Python 3.5. As a result, the module may work slightly differently under different versions of Python 3.5. :::
