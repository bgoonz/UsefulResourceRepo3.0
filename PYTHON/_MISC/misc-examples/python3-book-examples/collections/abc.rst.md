# collections.abc \-\-- Abstract Base Classes for Containers

::: {.module synopsis="Abstract base classes for container data types."} collections.abc :::

Purpose

: Abstract base classes for container data types.

The `collections.abc` module contains abstract base classes that define the APIs for container data structures built into Python and provided by the `collections` module. Refer to `Abstract Base Classes`{.interpreted-text role="table"} for a list of the classes and their purposes.

Class Base Class(es) API Purpose

---

Container Basic container features, such as the `in` operator.

Hashable Adds support for providing a hash value for the container instance.

Iterable Can create an iterator over the container contents.

Iterator Iterable Is an iterator over the container contents.

Generator Iterator Extends iterators with the generator protocol from PEP 342.

Sized Adds methods for containers that know how big they are.

Callable For containers that can be invoked as a function.

Sequence Sized, Supports retrieving individual items, Iterable, iterating, and changing the order of Container items.

MutableSequence Sequence Supports adding and removing items to an instance after it has been created.

ByteString Sequence Combined API of `bytes` and `bytearray`.

Set Sized, Supports set operations such as Iterable, intersection and union. Container

MutableSet Set Adds methods for manipulating the set contents after it is created.

Mapping Sized, Defines the read-only API used by `dict`. Iterable,  
 Container

MutableMapping Mapping Defines the methods for manipulating the contents of a mapping after it is created.

MappingView Sized Defines the view API for accessing a mapping from an iterator.

ItemsView MappingView, Part of the view API. Set

KeysView MappingView, Part of the view API. Set

ValuesView MappingView Part of the view API.

Awaitable API for objects that can be used in `await` expressions, such as coroutines.

Coroutine Awaitable API for classes that implement the coroutine protocol.

AsyncIterable API for iterables compatible with `async for`, as defined in PEP 492.

AsyncIterator AsyncIterable API for asynchronous iterators.

: Abstract Base Classes

In addition to clearly defining the APIs for containers with different semantics, these abstract base classes can be used to test whether an object supports an API before invoking it using `isinstance()`. Some of the classes also provide implementations of methods, and they can be used as mix-ins to build up custom container types without implementing every method from scratch.
