# itertools \-\-- Iterator Functions

::: {.module synopsis="Iterator functions for efficient looping"} itertools :::

Purpose

: The itertools module includes a set of functions for working with sequence data sets.

The functions provided by `itertools` are inspired by similar features of functional programming languages such as Clojure, Haskell, APL, and SML. They are intended to be fast and use memory efficiently, and also to be hooked together to express more complicated iteration-based algorithms.

Iterator-based code offers better memory consumption characteristics than code that uses lists. Since data is not produced from the iterator until it is needed, all of the data does not need to be stored in memory at the same time. This \"lazy\" processing model can reduce swapping and other side-effects of large data sets, improving performance.

In addition to the functions defined in `itertools`, the examples in this section also rely on some of the built-in functions for iteration.

## Merging and Splitting Iterators

The `chain()` function takes several iterators as arguments and returns a single iterator that produces the contents of all of the inputs as though they came from a single iterator.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_chain.py :::

`chain()` makes it easy to process several sequences without constructing one large list.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_chain.py

1 2 3 a b c
```

If the iterables to be combined are not all known in advance, or need to be evaluated lazily, `chain.from_iterable()` can be used to construct the chain instead.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_chain_from_iterable.py :::

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_chain_from_iterable.py

1 2 3 a b c
```

The built-in function `zip()` returns an iterator that combines the elements of several iterators into tuples.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_zip.py :::

As with the other functions in this module, the return value is an iterable object that produces values one at a time.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_zip.py

(1, 'a')
(2, 'b')
(3, 'c')
```

`zip()` stops when the first input iterator is exhausted. To process all of the inputs, even if the iterators produce different numbers of values, use `zip_longest()`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_zip_longest.py :::

By default, `zip_longest()` substitutes `None` for any missing values. Use the `fillvalue` argument to use a different substitute value.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_zip_longest.py

zip stops early:
[(0, 0), (1, 1)]

zip_longest processes all of the values:
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, None)]
```

The `islice()` function returns an iterator which returns selected items from the input iterator, by index.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_islice.py :::

`islice()` takes the same arguments as the slice operator for lists: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. The start and step arguments are optional.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_islice.py

Stop at 5:
0 1 2 3 4

Start at 5, Stop at 10:
5 6 7 8 9

By tens to 100:
0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90
```

The `tee()` function returns several independent iterators (defaults to 2) based on a single original input.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_tee.py :::

`tee()` has semantics similar to the Unix `tee` utility, which repeats the values it reads from its input and writes them to a named file and standard output. The iterators returned by `tee()` can be used to feed the same set of data into multiple algorithms to be processed in parallel.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_tee.py

i1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
i2: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The new iterators created by `tee()` share their input, so the original iterator should not be used after the new ones are created.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_tee_error.py :::

If values are consumed from the original input, the new iterators will not produce those values:

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_tee_error.py

r: 0 1 2
i1: [3, 4]
i2: [3, 4]
```

## Converting Inputs

The built-in `map()` function returns an iterator that calls a function on the values in the input iterators, and returns the results. It stops when any input iterator is exhausted.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_map.py :::

In the first example, the lambda function multiplies the input values by 2. In a second example, the lambda function multiplies two arguments, taken from separate iterators, and returns a tuple with the original arguments and the computed value. The third example stops after producing two tuples because the second range is exhausted.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_map.py

Doubles:
0
2
4
6
8

Multiples:
0 * 5 = 0
1 * 6 = 6
2 * 7 = 14
3 * 8 = 24
4 * 9 = 36

Stopping:
(0, 0, 0)
(1, 1, 1)
```

The `starmap()` function is similar to `map()`, but instead of constructing a tuple from multiple iterators, it splits up the items in a single iterator as arguments to the mapping function using the `*` syntax.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_starmap.py :::

Where the mapping function to `map()` is called `f(i1, i2)`, the mapping function passed to `starmap()` is called `f(*i)`.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_starmap.py

0 * 5 = 0
1 * 6 = 6
2 * 7 = 14
3 * 8 = 24
4 * 9 = 36
```

## Producing New Values

The `count()` function returns an iterator that produces consecutive integers, indefinitely. The first number can be passed as an argument (the default is zero). There is no upper bound argument (see the built-in `range()` for more control over the result set).

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_count.py :::

This example stops because the list argument is consumed.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_count.py

(1, 'a')
(2, 'b')
(3, 'c')
```

The start and step arguments to `count()` can be any numerical values that can be added together.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_count_step.py :::

In this example, the start point and steps are `Fraction` objects from the `fraction`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_count_step.py

1/3: a
2/3: b
1: c
```

The `cycle()` function returns an iterator that repeats the contents of the arguments it is given indefinitely. Since it has to remember the entire contents of the input iterator, it may consume quite a bit of memory if the iterator is long.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_cycle.py :::

A counter variable is used to break out of the loop after a few cycles in this example.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_cycle.py

(0, 'a')
(1, 'b')
(2, 'c')
(3, 'a')
(4, 'b')
(5, 'c')
(6, 'a')
```

The `repeat()` function returns an iterator that produces the same value each time it is accessed.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_repeat.py :::

The iterator returned by `repeat()` keeps returning data forever, unless the optional `times` argument is provided to limit it.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_repeat.py

over-and-over
over-and-over
over-and-over
over-and-over
over-and-over
```

It is useful to combine `repeat()` with `zip()` or `map()` when invariant values need to be included with the values from the other iterators.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_repeat_zip.py :::

A counter value is combined with the constant returned by `repeat()` in this example.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_repeat_zip.py

0 over-and-over
1 over-and-over
2 over-and-over
3 over-and-over
4 over-and-over
```

This example uses `map()` to multiply the numbers in the range 0 through 4 by 2.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_repeat_map.py :::

The `repeat()` iterator does not need to be explicitly limited, since `map()` stops processing when any of its inputs ends, and the `range()` returns only five elements.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_repeat_map.py

2 * 0 = 0
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
2 * 4 = 8
```

## Filtering

The `dropwhile()` function returns an iterator that produces elements of the input iterator after a condition becomes false for the first time.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_dropwhile.py :::

`dropwhile()` does not filter every item of the input; after the condition is false the first time, all of the remaining items in the input are returned.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_dropwhile.py

Testing: -1
Testing: 0
Testing: 1
Yielding: 1
Yielding: 2
Yielding: -2
```

The opposite of `dropwhile()` is `takewhile()`. It returns an iterator that returns items from the input iterator as long as the test function returns true.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_takewhile.py :::

As soon as `should_take()` returns `False`, `takewhile()` stops processing the input.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_takewhile.py

Testing: -1
Yielding: -1
Testing: 0
Yielding: 0
Testing: 1
Yielding: 1
Testing: 2
```

The built-in function `filter()` returns an iterator that includes only items for which the test function returns true.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_filter.py :::

`filter()` is different from `dropwhile()` and `takewhile()` in that every item is tested before it is returned.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_filter.py

Testing: -1
Yielding: -1
Testing: 0
Yielding: 0
Testing: 1
Testing: 2
Testing: -2
Yielding: -2
```

`filterfalse()` returns an iterator that includes only items where the test function returns false.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_filterfalse.py :::

The test expression in `check_item()` is the same, so the results in this example with `filterfalse()` are the opposite of the results from the previous example.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_filterfalse.py

Testing: -1
Testing: 0
Testing: 1
Yielding: 1
Testing: 2
Yielding: 2
Testing: -2
```

`compress()` offers another way to filter the contents of an iterable. Instead of calling a function, it uses the values in another iterable to indicate when to accept a value and when to ignore it.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_compress.py :::

The first argument is the data iterable to process and the second is a selector iterable producing Boolean values indicating which elements to take from the data input (a true value causes the value to be produced, a false value causes it to be ignored).

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_compress.py

3 6 9
```

## Grouping Data {#itertools-groupby}

The `groupby()` function returns an iterator that produces sets of values organized by a common key. This example illustrates grouping related values based on an attribute.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_groupby_seq.py :::

The input sequence needs to be sorted on the key value in order for the groupings to work out as expected.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_groupby_seq.py

Data:
[(0, 0),
 (1, 1),
 (2, 2),
 (0, 3),
 (1, 4),
 (2, 5),
 (0, 6)]

Grouped, unsorted:
0 [(0, 0)]
1 [(1, 1)]
2 [(2, 2)]
0 [(0, 3)]
1 [(1, 4)]
2 [(2, 5)]
0 [(0, 6)]

Sorted:
[(0, 0),
 (0, 3),
 (0, 6),
 (1, 1),
 (1, 4),
 (2, 2),
 (2, 5)]

Grouped, sorted:
0 [(0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 6)]
1 [(1, 1), (1, 4)]
2 [(2, 2), (2, 5)]
```

## Combining Inputs

The `accumulate()` function processes the input iterable, passing the nth and n+1st item to a function and producing the return value instead of either input. The default function used to combine the two values adds them, so `accumulate()` can be used to produce the cumulative sum of a series of numerical inputs.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_accumulate.py :::

When used with a sequence of non-integer values, the results depend on what it means to \"add\" two items together. The second example in this script shows that when `accumulate()` receives a string input each response is a progressively longer prefix of that string.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_accumulate.py

[0, 1, 3, 6, 10]
['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'abcde']
```

It is possible to combine `accumulate()` with any other function that takes two input values to achieve different results.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_accumulate_custom.py :::

This example combines the string values in a way that makes a series of (nonsensical) palindromes. Each step of the way when `f()` is called, it prints the input values passed to it by `accumulate()`.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_accumulate_custom.py

a b
bab c
cbabc d
dcbabcd e
['a', 'bab', 'cbabc', 'dcbabcd', 'edcbabcde']
```

Nested `for` loops that iterate over multiple sequences can often be replaced with `product()`, which produces a single iterable whose values are the Cartesian product of the set of input values.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_product.py :::

The values produced by `product()` are tuples, with the members taken from each of the iterables passed in as arguments in the order they are passed. The first tuple returned includes the first value from each iterable. The _last_ iterable passed to `product()` is processed first, followed by the next to last, and so on. The result is that the return values are in order based on the first iterable, then the next iterable, etc.

In this example, the cards are ordered by value and then by suit.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_product.py

 2H  2D  2C  2S
 3H  3D  3C  3S
 4H  4D  4C  4S
 5H  5D  5C  5S
 6H  6D  6C  6S
 7H  7D  7C  7S
 8H  8D  8C  8S
 9H  9D  9C  9S
10H 10D 10C 10S
 JH  JD  JC  JS
 QH  QD  QC  QS
 KH  KD  KC  KS
 AH  AD  AC  AS
```

To change the order of the cards, change the order of the arguments to `product()`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header" emphasize-lines="10-11,17"} itertools_product_ordering.py :::

The print loop in this example looks for an Ace card, instead of the spade suit, and then adds a newline to break up the output.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_product_ordering.py

 2H  3H  4H  5H  6H  7H  8H  9H 10H  JH  QH  KH  AH
 2D  3D  4D  5D  6D  7D  8D  9D 10D  JD  QD  KD  AD
 2C  3C  4C  5C  6C  7C  8C  9C 10C  JC  QC  KC  AC
 2S  3S  4S  5S  6S  7S  8S  9S 10S  JS  QS  KS  AS
```

To compute the product of a sequence with itself, specify how many times the input should be repeated.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_product_repeat.py :::

Since repeating a single iterable is like passing the same iterable multiple times, each tuple produced by `product()` will contain a number of items equal to the repeat counter.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_product_repeat.py

Repeat 2:

(0, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2)
(1, 0) (1, 1) (1, 2)
(2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 2)

Repeat 3:

(0, 0, 0) (0, 0, 1) (0, 0, 2)
(0, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 2)
(0, 2, 0) (0, 2, 1) (0, 2, 2)
(1, 0, 0) (1, 0, 1) (1, 0, 2)
(1, 1, 0) (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 0) (1, 2, 1) (1, 2, 2)
(2, 0, 0) (2, 0, 1) (2, 0, 2)
(2, 1, 0) (2, 1, 1) (2, 1, 2)
(2, 2, 0) (2, 2, 1) (2, 2, 2)
```

The `permutations()` function produces items from the input iterable combined in the possible permutations of the given length. It defaults to producing the full set of all permutations.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_permutations.py :::

Use the `r` argument to limit the length and number of the individual permutations returned.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_permutations.py

All permutations:

abcd abdc acbd acdb adbc adcb
bacd badc bcad bcda bdac bdca
cabd cadb cbad cbda cdab cdba
dabc dacb dbac dbca dcab dcba

Pairs:

ab ac ad
ba bc bd
ca cb cd
da db dc
```

To limit the values to unique combinations rather than permutations, use `combinations()`. As long as the members of the input are unique, the output will not include any repeated values.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_combinations.py :::

Unlike with permutations, the `r` argument to `combinations()` is required.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_combinations.py

Unique pairs:

ab ac ad
bc bd
cd
```

While `combinations()` does not repeat individual input elements, sometimes it is useful to consider combinations that do include repeated elements. For those cases, use `combinations_with_replacement()`.

::: {.literalinclude caption="" start-after="#end_pymotw_header"} itertools_combinations_with_replacement.py :::

In this output, each input item is paired with itself as well as all of the other members of the input sequence.

```{.sourceCode .none}
$ python3 itertools_combinations_with_replacement.py

Unique pairs:

aa ab ac ad
bb bc bd
cc cd
dd
```
