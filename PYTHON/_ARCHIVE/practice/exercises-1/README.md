# Importing packages and modules
#  - Module - A Python code in a file or directory
#  - Package - A module which is a directory containing an __init__.py file
#  - Submodule - A module which is contained within a package
#  - Name - An exported function, class, or variable in a module
# Unlike JS, modules export ALL names contained within them without any special export key
# Assuming we have the following package with four submodules
#  math
#  |  __init__.py
#  | addition.py
#  | subtraction.py
#  | multiplication.py
#  | division.py
# If we peek into the addition.py file we see there's an add function
# addition.py
# We can import 'add' from other places because it's a 'name' and is automatically exported


# def add(num1, num2):
#     return num1 + num2


# Notice the . syntax because this package can import it's own submodules.
# Our __init__.py has the following files
# This imports the 'add' function
# And now it's also re-exported in here as well
# from .addition import add
# These import and re-export the rest of the functions from the submodule
# from .subtraction import subtract
# from .division import divide
# from .multiplication import multiply
# So if we have a script.py and want to import add, we could do it many ways
# This will load and execute the 'math/__init__.py' file and give
# us an object with the exported names in 'math/__init__.py'
# print(math.add(1,2))
# This imports JUST the add from 'math/__init__.py'
# from math import add
# print(add(1, 2))
# This skips importing from 'math/__init__.py' (although it still runs)
# and imports directly from the addition.py file
# from math.addition import add
# This imports all the functions individually from 'math/__init__.py'
# from math import add, subtract, multiply, divide
# print(add(1, 2))
# print(subtract(2, 1))
# This imports 'add' renames it to 'add_some_numbers'
