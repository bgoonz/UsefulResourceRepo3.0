    </h2>
    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      A queue is a data structure that stores its items in a first-in, first-out
      (FIFO) order. That is precisely why it is called a queue. It functions
      just like a queue (or a line) would in everyday life. If you are the first
      to arrive at the check-in desk at a hotel, you will be the first to be
      served (and therefore, the first person to exit the queue). So, in other
      words, the items that are added to the queue first are the first items to
      be removed from the queue.

    <p><strong>Enqueue</strong></p>
    <p>
      To enqueue an item (add an item to the back of the queue) takes
      <code>O(1)</code> time.

    <p><strong>Dequeue</strong></p>
    <p>
      To dequeue an item (remove an item from the front of the queue) takes

    </p>
    <p><strong>Space</strong></p>
    <p>
      The space complexity of a queue is linear (<code>O(n)</code>). Each item

    <h4 id="strengths">Strengths</h4>

      There are no weaknesses in this data structure. The reason is that it is a
      very targeted data structure designed to do a few things well.

    <h4 id="when-are-queues-useful">When are queues useful?</h4>
    <p>
      Queues are useful data structures in any situation where you want to make
      sure things are processes in a FIFO order. Think of a web server. The
      server might be trying to service thousands of page requests per minute.
      It would make the most sense for the server to process and respond to the
      requests in the same order that they were received. That way, the first
      client to request a page is the first client to receive a response. Also,
      you’ll learn soon enough about traversing hierarchical data structures.
      One of the ways you do that is called a breadth-first traversal. To
      conduct a breadth-first traversal, a queue can be used.

      weaknesses, and the common uses of a stack
    </h2>
    <h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      A stack data structure handles information in a last-in, first-out order.
      This means that the last item added to the storage will be the first item
      removed from the storage. A stack is like having a paper tray inbox on
      your desk. Anytime a person walks by and drops a piece of paper or a
      letter in your inbox, it will go on the top of your inbox. So, when you
      process your inbox, the first item you would remove from the top of the
      stack of papers would be the last item added to it.

    <h4 id="when-are-stacks-useful">When are stacks useful?</h4>
    <p>
      Stacks can be useful in any situation where you desire a LIFO order. One
      common use-case is for parsing strings. Let’s say you wanted to parse a
      string to ensure that all the parentheses in your string are correctly
      nested. A stack could be useful for this. When you encounter an opening
      parenthesis, you add it to the stack. When you encounter a closing
      parenthesis, you remove the top opening parenthesis from the stack. After
      going through all the characters in the string, the stack should be empty.
      If it isn’t or if you try to remove an item from an empty stack, you’ll
      know that the parentheses were not correctly nested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, function calls and execution contexts are managed on a call
      stack. When you call a function, it’s added to the call stack. When it
      returns, it gets popped off of the stack. Last, an iterative
      depth-first-search can be done using a stack.

      Objective 03 - Implement a queue using a linked list
    </h2>
    <h3 id="overview-2">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      To implement a queue, we need to maintain two pointers. One pointer will
      point at the front (the first item) of the queue, and another pointer will
      point at the rear (the last item) of the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we need to have two methods available:
      <code>enqueue()</code> and <code>dequeue()</code>.
      <code>enqueue()</code> adds a new item after the rear.
      <code>dequeue()</code> removes the front node and resets the front pointer
      to the next node.
    </p>
    <h3 id="follow-along-2">Follow Along</h3>
    <p>
      We will use a <code>LinkedListNode</code> class for each of the items in
      the queue.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class LinkedListNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None</code></pre>
    <p>
      For our <code>Queue</code> class, we first need to define an
      <code>__init__</code> method. This method should initialize our instance
      variables <code>front</code> and <code>rear</code>.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.front = None
        self.rear = None</code></pre>
    <p>Next, we need to define our <code>enqueue</code> method:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.front = None
        self.rear = None
    def enqueue(self, item):
        new_node = LinkedListNode(item)
        # check if queue is empty
        if self.rear is None:
            self.front = new_node
            self.rear = new_node
        else:
            # add new node to rear
            self.rear.next = new_node
            # reassign rear to new node
            self.rear = new_node</code></pre>
    <p>Now, we need to define our <code>dequeue</code> method:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.front = None
        self.rear = None
    def enqueue(self, item):
        new_node = LinkedListNode(item)
        # check if queue is empty
        if self.rear is None:
            self.front = new_node
            self.rear = new_node
        else:
            # add new node to rear
            self.rear.next = new_node
            # reassign rear to new node
            self.rear = new_node
    def dequeue(self):
        # check if queue is empty
        if self.front is not None:
            # keep copy of old front
            old_front = self.front
            # set new front
            self.front = old_front.next

        # check if the queue is now empty
        if self.front is None:
            # make sure rear is also None
            self.rear = None

        return old_front</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now we have a <code>Queue</code> class that uses a singly-linked list as
      the underlying data structure.
