          <h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Current physics explains well most of known phenomena, yet it lacks
            answers to the fundamentals questions.
          </p>
          <p>It explains mostly 'how' questions, but less 'why' questions.</p>
          <p>
            Here I will try to answer these questions. The answers are
            scientific speculations.
          </p>
          <p>The physics chapter includes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Basic concepts definitions.</li>
            <li>
              Deriving part of special relativity theory from the basic
              concepts.
            </li>
            <li>Assumptions about the universe.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3><a name="space"></a>What is space?</h3>
          <p>
            Space is vacuum that has spatial waves that advance only at the
            speed of light (<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>c</i></font
            >).<br />
            The space has several dimensions. The 3 dimensions that we know (<i
              ><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">x,y,z</font></i
            >) and at least 6 closed modulated dimensions that are modulated to
            the size that is smaller then proton.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does not mean that the regular 3 dimensions are not modulated.
            If they are modulated, they have the size of the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use these assumptions for explaining the other concepts.
          </p>
          <h3><a name="matter"></a>What is matter?</h3>
          <p>
            Matter is a type of spatial wave that is directed to the modulated
            dimensions.<br />
            When the spatial wave forms electrons, protons and neutrons, it is a
            part of a wave group of an object like a chair or a man.<br />
            Quantum mechanics claims that matter particle can be found with
            different probabilities on several places. Actually the particle is
            really scattered on several places, since it is a spatial wave.<br />
            A visual example to the unity of matter and space can be found
            with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tv5.org/TV5Site/la_linea/">La Linea</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h3><a name="velocity"></a>What is velocity?</h3>
          <p>
            When we move an object in space like a ball with a constant velocity
            of <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>v</i></font
            >, the ball's speed does not change and the direction does not
            change. Yet the molecules of the ball are moving with Brownian
            motion and the electrons are circling the atoms with their own
            velocity.<br />
            The velocity is defined as the 3 dimensional vector component of the
            spatial wave vector: <br />
            <img src="physics/tmol_img_1.gif" align="center" />
          </p>
          <p>
            When <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">c</font></i> is the
            speed of the spatial wave in hyperspace (speed of light) and
            <img src="physics/tmol_img_2.gif" align="center" />is the angle
            between the spatial wave vector and its 3D vector component.
          </p>
          <h3 align="left">
            <a name="speedmatter"></a>Why is the speed of light is smaller in
            matter?
          </h3>
          <p align="left">
            When light travels through matter the speed of light seems to be
            reduced below <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>c</i></font
            >.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            Matter is bended space so the light has longer way to go when it
            travels trough matter. This results with reduced speed of light
            inside matter.
          </p>
          <h3 align="left">
            <a name="limit"></a>Why is the highest speed is the speed of light?
          </h3>
          <p align="left">
            According to Einstein's relativity theory you can't pass the speed
            of light. <br />
            The reason for this outcome is because hyperspace waves run only at
            the speed of light, so 3D space movement must be less then or equal
            to the speed of light. Imagine a car that drives in a constant speed
            <i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">c</font></i> and a constant
            direction in an
            <i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">x-y</font></i> plain, the
            velocity vector has magnitude of
            <i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">c</font></i> , but if we
            will look at the velocity in the
            <i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">x</font></i>
            direction (<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"
              ><i>v<sub>x</sub></i></font
            >), the magnitude of the velocity component must be less then or
            equal to<i> <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">c</font>:</i>

          </p>
          <h3><a name="force"></a>What is force?</h3>
          <p align="left">
            Force is a spatial wave that bends the direction of another spatial
            wave. <br />
            Force is defined as the amount of direction bending of a spatial
            wave by another spatial wave. When a spatial wave direction is
            bended it is accelerated.
          </p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="energy"></a>What is energy?</h3>
          <p align="left">
            Energy is any type of spatial wave that can increase the velocity of
            matter particles, when interacted.
          </p>
          <h3 align="left"><a name="time"></a>What is time?</h3>
          <p align="left">
            We are used to think about time as an additional fourth dimension to
            the 3 spatial dimensions.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Here I will introduce a different approach.</p>
          <p align="left">
            Time is defined as a
            <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
              <i>spatial state </i>or
              <i>three dimensional spatial state</i></font
            >.<br />
            Time change is defined as a
            <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
              <i>three dimensional spatial state change</i></font
            >.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            These definitions can be expanded when applied to subsets of
            hyperspace.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            Since all spatial waves advance with the speed of light (
            <i> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">c</font> </i> ), the time
            actually can be derived from the velocity and the 3 dimensional
            distance that the spatial wave moves. <br />

            When an object is at rest, the Brownian motion has the average

            .

          <p align="left">
            Because the spatial wave advance always at the speed of <i>c</i> ,

            The Brownian motion has decreased by a factor of

          <p align="left">
            While we read this page, we are traveling through time. When we
            speak about time travel, we mean that the time traveler is going
            through a process that freezes his own time while the rest of the
            universe changes.<br />
            A guy is entering into a time machine and goes 10 years to the past.
            Then he kills himself and goes back to the future. This scenario is
            impossible it does not make sense and violates the causality
            principle. Thinking of time as a spatial state may simplify this
            discussion.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Here are 2 methods for forward time traveling:</p>

                Reverse all spatial waves in the universe (except yourself) or
                an isolated subset of the universe - the time should go
                backwards. Doing this of course is impossible. Yet we can wonder
                if the spatial waves are not already reversed. How can we
                determine that the time goes forward? Every morning that we
                think that we wakeup, we actually go to sleep (actually
                unsleeping, since all biologic process are reversed). We can
                picture this sort of universe like a backwards-played movie.

            We can't change the past, but we can try to change the consequences
            of the past. <br />
            Imagine a ball that is flying in space, its course was changed in
            the past, we want to undo the change - we need to change its course
            to the original path. <br />
            The past can be &quot;changed&quot; by undoing the unwanted results.
            <br />
            This can't be done in 100% change, but can be done roughly. <br />
            The change will probably be match harder to do now and will require
            much more energy, then doing it in the past.

          <p align="left">
            When you toss a coin, you can't tell which side the coin will land.
            The odds will be close to 50% for each side of the coin. Yet if you
            could measure the initial velocity the initial angle the mass and
            the shape of the coin, you could get a pretty accurate answer from a
            simulation. What has changed? You have now additional information.
            The completely random system is now perceived as almost
            deterministic system. <br />
            The universe is random in every subset of the universe, but

            The universe is random in every subset of the universe, since we

            This means that the universe is deterministic and not random. <br />
            Einstein expressed this idea with the phrase: 'God does not throw

            created the universe. <br />
            Astronomical big bang theory does not help much. The big bang theory
            was based on precise astronomical observations that all the galaxies
            in the universe are moving away from each other, like two dots on
            the surface of an inflating balloon. When applying these finding
            with linear estimation, suggests that the universe has started from
            one singular point. This means that the universe emerged from
            nothingness, first not universe and then universe. This is an
            unacceptable explanation, since it contradicts everything that
            happened afterwards. <br />
            More reasonable explanation is that the universe existed forever in
            the past and will exist forever in the future. <br />
            This idea is not new, it does not contradict the big bang theory, it
            just says that the universe did not started from one singular point.

            According the Hubble's observations and General relativity, the
            universe expands. <br />
            Actually the universe expands and shrinks at the same time: <br />
            While the universe expands, there is a lot of matter that shrinks
            within black holes.

            What is an object? An object is a spatial waves group with specific
            properties - like house or ball or light wave. Yet all spatial waves
            are part of hyperspace, so do objects really exist on their own?
