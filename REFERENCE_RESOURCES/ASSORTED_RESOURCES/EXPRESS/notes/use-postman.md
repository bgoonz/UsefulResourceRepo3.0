[Postman (Links to an external site.)](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a prevalent tool used to test APIs manually. It comes loaded with a lot of useful features that make testing APIs very easy and painless.

## Overview

Testing APIs is different from testing websites or web applications. A web browser is sufficient to test the latter, but for APIs, we need to make POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests and even modify the request headers.

For testing, we will use a tool called **Postman**. Postman and other similar tools allow full control when making requests. We can easily change the HTTP Method used, add JSON data to the body, add form data, add headers, examine the response, and more.

In Postman's case, you can do a lot more. But, for now, we'll limit our discussion to the basics needed to test APIs by passing test data and examining whether we're getting the expected response.

We recommend installing the native application for your Operating System.
