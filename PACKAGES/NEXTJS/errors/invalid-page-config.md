# Invalid Page Config

#### Why This Error Occurred

In one of your pages you did `export const config` with an invalid value.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

The pageâ€™s config must be an object initialized directly when being exported and not modified dynamically.

This is not allowed

    export const config = 'hello world'

This is not allowed

    const config = {}
    config.amp = true

This is not allowed

    export { config } from '../config'

This is allowed

    export const config = { amp: true }
