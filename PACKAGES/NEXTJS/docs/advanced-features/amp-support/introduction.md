# AMP Support

**Examples**

- [AMP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp)

With Next.js you can turn any React page into an AMP page, with minimal config, and without leaving React.

You can read more about AMP in the official [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) site.

## Enabling AMP

To enable AMP support for a page, and to learn more about the different AMP configs, read the [API documentation for `next/amp`](/docs/api-reference/next/amp.md).

## Caveats

- Only CSS-in-JS is supported. [CSS Modules](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support.md) arenâ€™t supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can [contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/10549).
