A Beautiful Site was founded in 2007 by [Cory LaViska](https://twitter.com/claviska), a full-stack software engineer and UX architect with nearly 20 years of experience. You may know Cory from his work on [Shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/), [Surreal CMS](https://www.surrealcms.com/), or [his open source work](https://github.com/claviska).

Cory holds a Master's degree in Information Technology and a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems, both from [Florida Tech](https://fit.edu/). His experience creating, maintaining, marketing, and supporting a SaaS product for over 10 years speaks to his capablities as a product owner and business manager. He's also a veteran of the [U.S. Army](https://www.goarmy.com/).

Open source software is something Cory has been passionate about for a long time. His most notable project is [Shoelace.style](https://shoelace.style/), a library of web components that boasts millions of monthly CDN downloads and a vibrant community of users. Much of his spare time is dedicated to building and maintaining open source software.

Cory is currently a senior software engineer at Microsoft building great things with web components. In prior roles, he led the charge to establish and deliver a framework-agnostic design system for a $300M organization; he has been the lead engineer in a university-wide website redesign; he digitized an in-person orientation system for a university that saved an estimated $42K per year; he built a production tracking app that powers a complex manufacturing process for machine shops; and he has served as a consultant for numerous organzations.

Cory describes himself as a developer with an eye for design. His philosophy is that software should be simple. In fact, he is an enemy of complexity and over-engineering and believes that software should be smarter and conform to _our_ needs, not the other way around.

As a New Hampshire native, Cory spent many years living under the Florida sun. He now resides back home in New Hampshire.
