        <h1>Thoughts on being a good manager</h1>

        <p>
          Some thoughts I had after conversations with a friend who has a
          terrible manager. This isn't nearly a comprehensive list, but it
          highlights many of the problems they were experiencing. Maybe my
          friend's manager will stumble upon it some day.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >When someone has a grievance, take an objective stance.</strong
          >
          Listen to them, understand what they're trying to tell you, and react
          accordingly. Don’t deny issues that really are issues, and don’t
          ignore them in hopes that the problems just go away. They won’t.
          They’ll just snowball into bigger issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You’re the manager.</strong> You’re in charge of making sure
          the organization is running smoothly. If an employee is faltering,
          it’s your job to step in and help get things back up to speed. Don’t
          expect everyone else to pick up the slack—they have a lot of work to
          do too. As a manager, you’ll gain a lot of respect for getting “down
          in the trenches” when the team really needs you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Discipline employees when they need to be disciplined.</strong
          >
          Have a plan in place and follow it for everyone. No exceptions,
          otherwise you risk enabling abusers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t be afraid of confrontation.</strong> This is a sign of
          weakness, and cunning employees will take advantage of it time after
          time. When the moment comes, stand your ground, explain the problem
          clearly, and be prepared to offer a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Realize when something is out of an employee’s control</strong
          >
          (e.g. bereavement leave) versus under an employee’s control (e.g.
          personal appointments). In case of the latter, insist they try to make
          time for it outside of their normal work schedule. If that’s not
          possible, require them to make up missed time before work, after work,
          or during lunch. This compromise asserts the employee’s value to the
          organization and will significantly reduce absenteeism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody deserves preferential treatment, no matter who they are or what
          their situation is. Business is business, and if someone has committed
          to a position, they should honor that commitment or step down until
          they have the time and energy to resume their obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >When you hire someone and train them for a position, let them do
            their job.</strong
          >
          Correct them when mistakes are made, but if the job is being done
          correctly and with reasonable efficiency, don’t keep stepping in to
          micromanage them. This is frustrating for employees, and it’s also a
          trait of poor management skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Treat your employees like an investment:</strong> pay them
          well and they will perform well. Don’t tell them that the organization
          doesn’t have enough money to provide raises—most employees are smarter
          than that. Give them what they’re worth and set goals for them to earn
          more. This will motivate them, reduce turnover, and show compassion.
          Your employees will remember that and will be more apt to stick around
          and do great work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A workplace is like a team:</strong> you have a group of
          people working together to achieve a common goal. Each player in a
          team has a specific purpose. When one of those players is
          underperforming or absent, the rest of the team has to make up for it.
          When this happens on a regular basis, morale suffers and players
          become disgruntled—some may even choose to quit. As the “team
          captain”, this is your fault—not theirs. Don’t let other players
          adversely affect the rest of the team. It’s your job to step in and
          keep everything in line.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Know when to let someone go.</strong> It's always better for
          the organization and the employee to try to work things out. Alas, the
          time will come when an employee is no longer a good fit for their
          position and you need to be OK with letting them go. It's not the end
          of the world. In many cases the employee will find a new job that
          suits them even better. If nothing else, being let go is an eye opener
          that can actually help them become a better employee at their next
          job.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>At the end of the day, you're the manager.</strong> How your
          organization operates is a reflection of you. So here's something to
          keep in mind. It's a quote from Napoleon that I hope will resonate in
          your thoughts for the rest of your management career: &quot;An army of
          lions commanded by a deer will never be an army of lions.&quot;
