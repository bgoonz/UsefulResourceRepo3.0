            Heads up! This post was written in 2007, so it may contain
            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please
            keep this in mind as you're reading.

          An internal build of IE8 is reported to have passed the
          <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/tests/evil/acid/002/">Acid 2 test</a>.
          This is great news, as Microsoft is showing more and more progress
          towards incorporating web standards into Internet Explorer, even
          though IE7 has remained dormant since it's release back in October
          2006.

          was a breath of fresh air, but I was very impressed by one statement
          in particular:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            With respect to standards and interoperability, our goal in
            developing Internet Explorer 8 is to support the right set of
            standards with excellent implementations and do so without breaking
            the existing web. This second goal refers to the lessons we learned
            during IE 7. IE7's CSS improvements made IE more compliant with some
            standards and less compatible with some sites on the web as they
            were coded. Many sites and developers have done special work to work
            well with IE6, mostly as a result of the evolution of the web and
            standards since 2001 and the level of support in the various
            versions of IE that pre-date many standards. We have a
            responsibility to respect the work that sites have already done to
            work with IE. We must deliver improved standards support and
            backwards compatibility so that IE8 (1) continues to work with the
            billions of pages on the web today that already work in IE6 and IE7
            and (2) makes the development of the next billion pages, in an
            interoperable way, much easier. We'll blog more, and learn more,
            about this during the IE8 beta cycle.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          A lot of people argue Microsoft's ability to create a browser that is
          standards compliant, but the preceding paragraph highlights a few
          important points. Whether they want to or not, Microsoft has an
          obligation to make their software backwards compatible. This is
          understandable to a reasonable degree, especially considering the fact
          that a significant number of websites would suffer considerably if
          they didn''t.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Beta version of IE8 is expected to be available in the first half of
          2008.
