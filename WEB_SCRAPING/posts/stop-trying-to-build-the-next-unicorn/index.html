        <p>
          So, you're building the next big thing? You say you're going to make
          millions and have a fancy office building out in the valley? That's
          cool. By the same odds we'll both be rich, because I'm holding
          tonight's winning lotto ticket.
        </p>
        <h2 id="your-idea-probably-won't-be-the-next-big-thing">
          Your idea probably won't be the next big thing

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's true. The odds are against you. Whatever you're building probably
          won't be the next Facebook or Twitter, but that doesn't mean you can't
          make a living doing what you love.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounds discouraging, but I'm really just trying to bring you down
          to earth. Stop reading all those articles about multi-million dollar
          funding rounds and IPOs. They're exciting. They trigger ambition. But
          they're not realistic. You might as well be reading about last night's
          lottery winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're probably well aware that
          <a
            href="http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-odds-of-success-2013-5"
            >most startups fail</a
          >. It's a vicious world out there with entrepreneurs trying
          desperately to get their ideas funded. They have an exit strategy even
          before they have a product. Building something great has taken a
          backseat to trying to become a billionaire.
        </p>
        <h2 id="success-may-not-be-what-you-think-it-is">
          Success may not be what you think it is

        </h2>
        <p>
          When someone says &quot;success&quot;, what do you think of? Is it the
          money? The fame? The idea of retiring young? Is it having big houses
          and little cars? What type of lifestyle would you live if you were
          &quot;successful&quot; by your own standard?
        </p>
        <p>
          When we're young, we're taught to aim for the sky, but success doesn't
          have to be so glamourous. In fact,

          <p>
            If we can get people just a little bit more informed, so they know
            that getting the $20 million or $200 million won’t necessarily bring
            them all that they’d hoped for, then maybe they’d concentrate
            instead on things that would make the world a better place and could
            help to make them truly happy.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So what makes you truly happy?</p>

        <p>
          What if you could live in a comfortable house, have a nice car, work
          decent hours, enjoy the work you do, have a healthy budget for your
          day-to-day needs, and be able to spend more time with your family and
          friends? The average person would kill to have this life. (If you
          didn't know that already, you must be a very fortunate person.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, your success is based on many things that are important
          to you, not just your work. When you put too much focus on one thing,
          everything else ends up on the back burner. Working too much can

          and even cause you to

            >die young</a
          >. I wouldn't consider that to be very successful.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how do you reach that balance yet still be successful? There's
          nothing wrong with aiming high—just don't aim too high.

          Some people don't like the term
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business"
            >lifestyle business</a
          >. If you're not familiar with it, a good definition is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            A business that is set up and run by its founders primarily with the
            aim of sustaining a particular level of income and no more; or to
            provide a foundation from which to enjoy a particular lifestyle.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          That's exactly what I started in 2008, albeit unknowingly. Of course,
          at the time, I was hoping my service would take off and be the next
          big thing—but it wasn't. It didn't make me millions of dollars and it
          didn't attract a group of check-writing VCs. But it also didn't crush
          my dreams. Rather, it enlightened me.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see, I ended up starting a sustainable business that's been paying
          my bills since 2008. I live the life I mentioned above, and I consider
          myself reasonably successful. I have a great service that I enjoy
          running, awesome users that I love helping, and there's nobody I have
          to report to at work. I take most weekends off and have plenty of time
          for family. In fact, I'll be celebrating my honeymoon for a week in
          the Caribbean next month. Life is good running a lifestyle business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Does that mean I won't reach a bit higher with my next project?
          Absolutely not. I'd love to start another service that's just as (or
          more) successful than what I'm doing now, but I'm not going to let it
          dictate my life. The truth is, I'm happy running a lifestyle business.
          I'm not trying to build the next unicorn and, unless you like being
          disappointed, neither should you. You'll find much more success in
          launching something smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're stuck with that &quot;go big or go home&quot; mentality, my
          advice to you is figure out what you're good at, find a niche you
          enjoy, and start solving a problem. Grow your idea slowly but
          steadily, be good to your users, and stop worrying about becoming a
          millionaire. With your focus on building something you believe in,
          you'll have a much better chance of success and you just might end up
          with a business that will be around for years to come. That's way
          better than most startups do.
        </p>
        <p>
          And who knows? Maybe your idea will take you to the top. But if it
          doesn't, at least you'll still be doing something you love.
