            Heads up! This post was written in 2007, so it may contain
            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please
            keep this in mind as you're reading.

          A friend of mine recently graduated and spread his wings by venturing
          into the corporate world. He obtained a position as a junior project
          manager for a web consulting firm in Atlanta. Their work is very
          professional and their designs are great, but it was immediately
          evident that they had no understanding of web standards whatsoever. I
          asked my friend about his company's stance on the matter.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I asked about that. The sites we build are for industrial use,
            non-computer people, so we make em work and don't fuss about the
            minor details — web standards anyway. We focus on functionality.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          [Jeffrey Zeldman](Jeffrey Zeldman) would pop a blood vessel if he had
          heard that. After all, isn't that what web standards is all about?
          Seems like someone is missing the point here. Mark my word, web
          companies that worry more about the appearance of their work than the
          framework that supports it will soon find themselves struggling to
          keep up with the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, I'd like to recommend a very good book called
          <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/">Designing With Web Standards</a
          >. Whether you want to give a hard-headed employer some insight about
          the future of the web or you just want to learn a little bit about it
          yourself, this book will provide you with a complete understanding of
          what the web was meant to be, and how we're going to get it there.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            An equal opportunity disease afflicts nearly every site now on the
            web, from the humblest personal home pages to the multi-million
            dollar sites of corporate giants. Cunning and insidious, the disease
            goes largely unrecognized because it is based on industry norms.
            Although their owners and managers might not know it yet, 99.9% of
            all websites are obsolete.
          </p>
