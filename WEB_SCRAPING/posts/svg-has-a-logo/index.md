# SVG has a logo

August 01, 2014 • 1 min read

HTML5 was the first to get an [official logo](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/). Web designers rejoiced, some even hacking together matching logos [for CSS](http://www.bobbyberberyan.com/2012/03/html-5-css-3-logos/). But did you know that SVG also has an official logo, and it's—flowery?

The W3C describes it as:

> The flower-like structure of the SVG logo evokes creativity and growth, while the connected nodes indicate integration with other technologies.

The logo was based off a design by [Harvey Rayner](http://www.root2art.co.uk/svg_logo_download/index.php). According to the W3C:

> It was selected by the SVG Working Group from among hundreds of entries in a contest conducted in 2006 by supporters and vendors of the SVG format.

It's a very symbolic representation of an otherwise difficult technology to sum up in an image. I'd say it's a decent fit, but the version without text might confuse people.

What do you think of the SVG logo? Have you seen it used anywhere? I have to be honest, I'm on the Internet quite a bit and only stumbled across this yesterday. I wonder what other cool logos I'm missing out on.
