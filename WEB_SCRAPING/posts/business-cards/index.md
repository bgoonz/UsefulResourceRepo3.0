Heads up! This post was written in 2007, so it may contain information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please keep this in mind as you're reading.

[VistaPrint](http://vistaprint.com/) delivered 1,000 “A Beautiful Site” business cards the other day, and I couldn't resist playing with them.

I decided to go conservative with the design, relying a bit on curiosity to draw attention to the business. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the way they turned out.
