            Heads up! This post was written in 2009, so it may contain
            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please
            keep this in mind as you're reading.

          I remember, not too long ago, arguing with people who said that
          JavaScript would never be as good as Flash. Granted, at the time many
          people were afraid of JavaScript and, thus, it wasn't used as widely
          as it is today. With the introduction of popular libraries such as
          <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>,
          <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>,
          <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a> and
          <a href="http://www.extjs.com/">many</a>,
          <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">many</a>,
          <a href="http://mochikit.com/">many</a> others, JavaScript has been on
          the forefront of the Web 2.0 movement. In fact, it's rare today to
          visit a webpage that doesn't use JavaScript for at least
          <em>something</em>. Sure, Flash is still pretty popular, but trends
          seem to indicate that people are moving further away from it for
          design and reserving it for <a href="http://youtube.com/">videos</a>,
          <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/uploader/">file uploaders</a>,
          <a href="http://www.pogo.com/">online games</a>, and
          <a href="http://aviary.com/">high level web-based applications</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >So why bother comparing JavaScript to Flash? Everyone knows Flash
            is better, right?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          And by <em>better</em>, we can pretty much agree that Flash can do
          smoother animations, higher level programming, awesome 3D stuff...the
          list goes on. In fact, you can make an entire website out of pure
          Flash if you so desire, and it will look exactly the same in every
          browser. Why use anything else?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well,
          <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html"
            >Flash has its problems</a
          >, and that goes without even mentioning the fact that it's a
          closed-source, proprietary technology. (Hint:
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript"
            >JavaScript <em>isn't</em></a
          >.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >But still, you can't do much when it comes to JavaScript. I mean,
            it's slow, clunky, and each browser does things just a little bit
            differently.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, this is very much true. Until now, and even still to some degree,
          JavaScript remains an emerging technology for more advanced
          applications such as
          <a
            href="http://sixrevisions.com/javascript/10-impressive-javascript-animation-frameworks/"
            >animation</a
          >, <a href="http://ui.jquery.com/">user interface</a>, and even
          <a
            href="http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/25-amazing-javascript-games-some-fun-and-inspiration/"
            >games</a
          >, but it is by no means primitive. Proof of this lays with JSNES, an
          8-bit Nintendo Emulator that was built purely in JavaScript.
        </p>

          <img

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're running Internet Explorer right now, don't bother with the
          link. You'll need to switch to
          <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> if you want to play it
          at near-normal speed. Even Firefox's JavaScript engine is too slow,
          but it's playable...just really slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there you have it. No, JavaScript isn't anywhere near Flash in
          speed or capabilities, but it's definitely getting there and it's
          making plenty of waves in the process.
