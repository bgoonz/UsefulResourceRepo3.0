Lessons from my 20s: a presentation by Ryan Allis
=================================================

August 12, 2014 • 1 min read

Author and entrepreneur [Ryan Allis](https://twitter.com/ryanallis) shares 1,264 slides about life, entrepreneurship, and the world.

We all have goals, but sometimes they seem hard to reach. Really hard. Life happens and things get tough, but don't let it get you down. It's not impossible. It just means you'll have to work a little harder smarter.

If you're like me, you're driven by aspiration, but it can be easy to get lost on the road to success. Sometimes, simply writing down your goals can make them that much more obtainable. It may sound silly, but it's been repeated by too many successful people to ignore, and Ryan Allis is one of them.

> The first ever goal I wrote down at age 16 was "build a company to $1M in sales by 21. I missed this goal by 18 days.

[In this monster presentation](http://hive.org/20s/), Ryan shares many experiences and provides great inspiration for anyone with an interest in running a successful business.

It's a long read and lots of scrolling, so make sure you save it for later if you don't have the time to absorb it all today.
