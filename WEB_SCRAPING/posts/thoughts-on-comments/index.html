        <h1>Thoughts on comments</h1>

        <div class="post-date">
          <time datetime="2016-06-12"> June 12, 2016 </time>
          &bull; 3 min read
        </div>

        <p>
          For as long as I can remember, comments have been a staple of blogging
          software. After all, what's a good blog post without a relevant
          discussion to accompany it?
        </p>
        <p>
          You might find it strange to learn that Postleaf doesn't ship with
          comments. This is by design, and I'll explain why in this post.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-comment-problem">
          The Comment Problem
          <a class="direct-link" href="#the-comment-problem">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Everyone thinks they want comments on their blog. That is, until they
          have to deal with the problems that those comments create. The biggest
          problem is by far comment spam. This is such a huge issue that the
          makers of WordPress established
          <a href="https://akismet.com/">a dedicated service</a> just to fight
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why does it happen? Well, spammers post bogus comments, those
          comments contain links, and those links make them money when people
          click. Since it costs them practically nothing to do it, they keep
          posting comment spam. A lot of it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="fighting-spam">
          Fighting Spam <a class="direct-link" href="#fighting-spam">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways to fight comment spam. One is to moderate all
          comments before they go public. This really sucks because comments
          don't go live immediately and you have to manually approve every
          single one. That makes it hard to have a discussion and it can fill up
          your inbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another approach is to add some kind of crazy
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> test to
          your comment form, but these can be difficult even for humans and
          often discourage visitors from leaving comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://xkcd.com/233/"
            ><img
              src="../../images/a-new-captcha-approach.png"
              alt="XKCD comic: a new CAPTCHA approach"
          /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most effective approach is to require users to create an
          account, verify their email address, and then let them post. But let's
          be honest, how many people are actually going to take the time to do
          that? In my experience, not very many. Most people aren't comfortable
          typing their email address into a web form, so they're probably not
          going to give you their name, email address, and a password.
        </p>
        <h2 id="everyone-has-an-opinion">
          Everyone Has An Opinion
          <a class="direct-link" href="#everyone-has-an-opinion">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Yes, everyone. And many of them feel invincible hiding behind their
          keyboard so they're not afraid to force that opinion down your throat
          in the comments. Which brings us to the next big problem with
          comments: <em>accountability</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you force users to create an account before posting a comment,
          there's nothing stopping them from using a bogus name and email
          address. You're going to end up with a lot of flaming, trash talking,
          and senseless discussions because there's a huge lack of
          accountability on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/"

              alt="XKCD comic: duty calls"
          /></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          So how do we fix that? Well, I could spend the next year trying to
          develop the perfect comment system for Postleaf, but it's a massive
          undertaking and, to be honest, it would probably never really be good
          enough.<a href="https://xkcd.com/233/">https://xkcd.com/233/</a>
        </p>
        <p>So what now? Do we ditch comments altogether? ðŸ¤”</p>
        <h2 id="a-better-way">
          A Better Way <a class="direct-link" href="#a-better-way">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some time ago, I got tired of dealing with comment problems and
          disabled them on my blog. The conversation went quiet, and I started
          to feel alone in the world. (Ok, not really, but still, not allowing
          comments at all was pretty lame.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I decided to try out
          <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. I added a small JavaScript
          snippet to my website and BOOM, comments. But not just any comments,
          good comments.
        </p>
        <h3 id="why-disqus-works">
          Why Disqus Works <a class="direct-link" href="#why-disqus-works">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The power of Disqus is in its community. Users login to their Disqus
          account (which they can create from your site if they don't already
          have one) and they're able to post comments to your blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're probably wondering, &quot;how is this any different from
          letting them create an account on <em>my</em> website?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It's very different, because they only need to create one account
          which can be used on any website that runs Disqus. You have immediate
          access to millions of registered users that you don't have to bother
          keeping track of. Furthermore, Disqus lets users login through
          Facebook, Twitter, or Google, which provides the best form of
          accountability you're going to get on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I started using Disqus, I haven't had to deal with comment spam
          and the conversation has been just that â€” a conversation. Disqus
          handles notifications so I know when people post comments and they
          know when I respond. I can even reply to notifications with various
          commands to moderate comments by email â€” a huge time saver! ðŸ“«
        </p>
        <p><em>Update: February 26, 2017</em></p>
        <p>
          As of February 2017, Disqus converted their free plan into an
          ad-supported plan. That means, unless you remove Disqus from your
          website or fork up $10 per month, your website is going to show ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm in no way opposed to a SaaS making money, but this feels like a
          bait and switch. Nobody gets to opt out. Nobody gets grandfathered in.
          You either pay up, stop using Disqus, or your visitors get subjected
          to whatever ads Disqus wants to show on your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not having control over one's own website is something I'm vehemently
          against.
        </p>
        <h2 id="comments-in-postleaf">
          Comments in Postleaf
          <a class="direct-link" href="#comments-in-postleaf">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Comments shouldn't be a chore. They should form relevant, civil
          discussions that engage your visitors. When you spend all your time
          moderating comments, you end up with less time for the finer things in
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I intentionally left comments out of the Postleaf core. If
          you want them, I suggest finding a third-party platform or service
          that suits your needs for now. They are absolutely the best way to
          promote relevant discussions on your blog without the hassle of
          dealing with traditional comments.
