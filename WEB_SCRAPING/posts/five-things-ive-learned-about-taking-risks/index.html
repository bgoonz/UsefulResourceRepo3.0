        <p>
          I had a cush job at a university with great benefits, decent pay, and
          normal hours. Five years ago, I took a risk and gave it all up to
          start a company. Here are the five most important lessons I've learned
          about risk-taking.

        <p>
          People that jump into things too quickly tend to achieve unfavorable
          results. They get excited by the potential and become blind to the
          consequences. On the other hand, people that wait too long end up
          missing opportunities due to fear and reluctance. Taking risks can be
          stressful and dangerous, but it can also change your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've learned that there are good risks and bad risks, but figuring out
          how to measure them isn't easy. Even if you write down all the pros
          and cons, the answer might still be unclear. Perhaps that's why so
          many people talk about risks. It's a complicated subject.

            >Look how many books there are</a
          >
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd love to say &quot;just go with your gut&quot;, but that hasn't
          always worked for me. You have to be smart enough to recognize
          opportunity while being cautious enough to realize what's at stake.
          It's a lot like gambling, but if you understand the game you're
          playing you have a much better shot at coming out ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do your research. Run numbers. Consider your best and worst case
          scenarios. Listen to your gut instinct, but don't let it trump logic.
          At the end of the day, there should be a little bit of comfort and a
          little bit of concern when you decide to take a risk. If either is
          missing, consider it a red flag.

        <p>
          When I quit my job, I already had something going on the side to help
          cover my expenses while the business ramped up. I planned it out so if
          things didn't go the way I expected, I'd have something to fall back
          on. I would never recommend risking everything without having some
          kind of safety net. That's a crapshoot and, if you've ever been to
          Vegas, you should know there's a good chance that it won't work out in
          your favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to taking risks is to take smart ones, which requires a solid
          understanding of how things work. Of course, there are always
          uncertainties—that's why it's called a &quot;risk&quot;—but you can
          stack the deck in your favor by being knowledgeable, timely, and
          persistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I launched my first product, it was second to market for the type
          of service it was. That means it wasn't featured on many tech blogs
          and it didn't get the kind of coverage or hype that its competitor
          did. Rather than give up, I decided to roll out some key features
          quickly and promote the service as much as possible anyway. Marketing
          wasn't my thing back then (it still isn't), but I studied up and kept
          at it. My persistence ultimately paid off. In November, my service
          will see its sixth profitable year of operation!

        </h2>
        <p>
          I talked to a lot of people before quitting my job. I spoke with my
          parents, my friends, and even some coworkers about it. Their advice
          was mixed. Some of them told me to go for it and start my own thing,
          but most of them told me it was a bad idea. While the former fueled my
          adrenaline, the latter made me very anxious. I wasn't sure how to
          handle that type of feedback. I mean, these people were all smart and
          well-educated and I thought my plan was solid. So who should I listen
          to?
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is none of them. While getting advice from smart and
          experienced people is perfectly fine, you shouldn't let others decide
          what risks you take in life. No matter how close you are to someone,
          they'll never fully understand your situation like you do. They don't
          know your financial status, how motivated you are, or how successful
          you'll be. They can only tell you what they would do (or what they
          wouldn't do) if they were in your shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that could be valuable advice if you're talking to a successful
          entrepreneur, but how many successful entrepreneurs do you personally
          know? I didn't know any, so I had to go with my gut. I listened to
          everyone's advice, thought it through, and decided to take the risk.
          Six years later, I have no regrets.

        <p>
          Oh, the many nights I've spent developing things, writing blog posts,
          fixing bugs, repairing databases, responding to support tickets, and
          playing around with new technologies. I'm fortunate enough to do what
          I love for a living, and I never take that for granted. Even when
          things get stressful, I never wish I were doing something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep things moving forward, I have numerous goals: growth, new
          products, hiring employees, an office building downtown...but there
          isn't any finish line, nor should there be. With each goal comes new
          risks, and with each risk my journey gets more exciting. There's no
          point at which you'll sit down and say, &quot;there, I've done it.
          It's all over now.&quot; Instead, you'll ask yourself, &quot;what can
          I do next?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you nailed that goal of $1M in revenue, you don't stop working
          and that's it. There's always something else you can turn your
          attention to. When you succeed, remember what works. When you fail,
          remember what doesn't. Use that to your advantage and you'll make
          better decisions in the future. If starting a business is like a road
          trip, then knowledge is your fuel. Don't worry so much about the
          destination—just enjoy the ride and keep putting gas in your tank.

        <p>
          Sometimes, it just isn't meant to be. Even if you've done something
          once, doing it again can be a completely different experience. I've
          played around with many ideas, developed prototypes, bought domain
          names, and most of them are just memories now. You have to know when
          to call it quits before it drags you down and burns you out.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a project I really wanted to develop a few years ago. I had
          a logo designed, created a website for it, and even had a partially
          working prototype until I hit a major road block. At the time, I had
          to make a decision. I already wasted months of resources working on a
          project that I didn't even know was viable, and another project was
          already overdue for a major update. Should I spend the next six months
          trying to get this thing to work while the other (more successful)
          project suffered? No way. It was time to call it quits.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have a lot of time invested into a project—especially your
          project—it can be very hard to let go. Maybe it's pride or simply the
          fear of failure. Maybe a bit of both? In the end, I knew I had to give
          up on it and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crazy thing is that once I killed the project, I felt so much
          better. It was a huge weight off my shoulders. I was able to focus on
          the more successful service and ultimately launched a new version that
          caused its user base to triple in one year!

        <p>
          Risk-taking shouldn't be something that scares you—it should be
          something that excites you. Look for opportunities, but be cautious
          and plan when to make your move. If you asked me for just one piece of
          advice I've learned about taking risks, it would be this:
