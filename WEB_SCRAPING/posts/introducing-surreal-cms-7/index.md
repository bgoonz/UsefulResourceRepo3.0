Introducing Surreal CMS 7
=========================

April 26, 2019 • 1 min read

Last November was the 10 year mark for [Surreal CMS](https://www.surrealcms.com/), a content management service I created to manage static (and mostly static) websites.

Last week, [I soft launched Surreal CMS 7](https://www.surrealcms.com/blog/announcing-surreal-cms-7.html). This new version is a complete rebuild from scratch using Node.js + Vue.js. I worked on this new app for a long time, and I'm incredibly happy with the result.

Everything has been improved in this version, and there's a bunch of great new features that really make static websites fun to manage. Early feedback from new and existing users has been overwhelmingly positive!

**I've also reintroduced the free plan** for personal, educational, and non-profit users!

The list of updates and improvements is way too long to list here, but you can check out the [official announcement](https://www.surrealcms.com/blog/announcing-surreal-cms-7.html) to learn more.
