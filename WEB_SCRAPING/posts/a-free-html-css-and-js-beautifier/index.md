A free HTML, CSS, and JavaScript beautifier
===========================================

May 22, 2019 â€¢ 1 min read

Ten years ago, I launched [DirtyMarkup](https://dirtymarkup.com/) to clean up dirty code. It was a fun little tool, but its best feature was that it was easy to use and didn't have intrusive advertisements.

I sold DirtyMarkup a couple years ago, and since then the new owners slapped on a header that makes the page scroll and some banner ads. ðŸ˜’

I missed having my own tool, so last week I built a new one from scratch thatâ€™s even better. ðŸ’ª

You can find it at: [surrealcms.com/beautify](https://www.surrealcms.com/beautify)

The new tool doesnâ€™t use Tidy. Instead, it relies on [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for cleaning up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. That means it doesnâ€™t require a binary and the results are instant.

If youâ€™re interested in how I built it, [I posted a write-up here](https://www.surrealcms.com/blog/creating-a-code-beautifier-in-two-days.html).
