        <p>
          Uploads management is a concept I've always struggled with in
          Postleaf, but it's a necessary evil. Users have to be able to view and
          delete files they upload; but at the same time, I've never felt that
          it should be an integral part of the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last night I had to face the fact that Postleaf isn't going to ship
          until it has a damn good uploads manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was time to face the inevitable. I stayed up
          <a href="https://twitter.com/postleafapp/status/844069264621559808"
            >all night</a
          >
          on a sort of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbccrO8qKog">vision quest</a>
          for ideas, and ultimately came up with what I feel is the perfect
          solution for Postleaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/uploads-manager.jpg"
            alt="A hand drawn wireframe of an uploads manager prototype"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept involves a panel that slides up from the bottom of the
          screen when the control is activated. Images and other files are
          displayed in lightbox-style gallery, along with the ability to search,
          delete, and download files. The panel can be dismissed by clicking or
          tapping outside of it or by pressing the escape key.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this concept because I don't believe the uploads manager
          deserves its own dedicated section in the admin panel. People use
          Postleaf to manage content, not files, so let's stay focused on what
          we came here to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Managing files is a secondary task, and this panel approach suits it
          well. The uploads manager can be accessed from anywhere in the app by
          pressing <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd>.
          Alternatively, it can be activated by a form control and used as a
          file picker.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a glimpse of an early prototype:</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/uploads-manager-preview.png"
            alt="Screenshot of the uploads manager in the Postleaf dashboard"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose a dark background because it brings more focus to your photos
          and files. I think it works really well, and I'm excited to bring this
          concept to life in Postleaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this rate, I should have the uploads manager ready to roll in a
          couple days!
        </p>
