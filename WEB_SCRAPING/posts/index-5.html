        <p>
          It's tempting to take out your frustrations on the support person
          answering your email, but don't send out a message raging about their
          incompetence. Don't tell them how their product sucks or doesn't work
          the way you expect it to. Don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS to make sure they
          understand that you're frustrated. It won't get you faster help—it
          just makes you look like an asshole.<br />
          I'm sure you've had your fair share of horrible customer experiences.
          It happens, but generally speaking, support teams want to help you
          resolve whatever issue you're having so you can continue using their
          product—and they want to do it as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, support isn't an easy job. I've done my fair share in the
          past, and I still help out my own customers to this day. Let me just
          be clear about one thing: nobody contacts support because everything
          is fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some tips you can use to better your odds of getting a
          resolution on your first interaction with support.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          What's obvious to you may not be obvious to the person reading your
          support ticket. Tell them exactly what's going on. Re-read what you
          wrote before sending it in and ask yourself if the following questions
          would make sense to another person:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What were you trying to do?</li>
          <li>How did you try to do it?</li>
          <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
          <li>What actually happened?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In most cases, this would be enough information for me to resolve a
          support ticket. Don't have tunnel vision when you submit your request.
          The person on the other end may not know that you were in a certain
          screen or trying to do a certain task. A clear, concise explanation
          will alleviate questions that are otherwise obvious to you and can
          result in a faster resolution.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          When applicable, provide a bulleted list of the steps you took to
          produce the error or problem. Unless they have a screen-sharing app,
          support has no way to see what you're seeing. Tell them what you
          click, type, or do in a simple list:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the &quot;User&quot; tab</li>
          <li>Select the user named &quot;Bob&quot;</li>
          <li>Click the dropdown under &quot;User Options&quot;</li>
          <li>Select &quot;Delete User&quot;</li>
          <li>An error occurs stating that the user cannot be deleted</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Don't say something like, &quot;I tried to delete Bob but
          couldn't.&quot; There could be many ways to delete a user and the way
          you're doing it could be broken—or you could be doing it wrong.
          Supports needs to know how you're doing things to replicate and fix
          whatever the issue is.
        </p>
        <h2 id="act-like-a-decent-person">
          Act like a decent person

        </h2>
        <p>
          It should go without saying, but some people still think that hiding
          behind their monitor and acting like a pretentious asshole is a great
          way to get help from support. Nothing personal, but the individual
          you're trying to get help from doesn't care if you're a CEO, a doctor,
          or the Pope. You're just a number, and reiterating how important you
          think you are doesn't do anything to get a faster resolution. Neither
          does sarcasm, name calling, or profanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to have a better support experience, just act like a
          decent human being. Throw a smiley in there to relieve the tension a
          bit. I guarantee you'll have a better shot at getting help if you
          don't act like a jerk. (Tip: I almost always pick the &quot;nice&quot;
          tickets before the &quot;mean&quot; ones and I pay more attention when
          those names come up again in the future.)
        </p>
        <h2 id="be-responsive">
          Be responsive <a class="direct-link" href="#be-responsive">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is absolutely critical if the support team requires additional
          information or clarification from you. Make yourself available to
          answer any questions and aid them in resolving the problem. I've seen
          tickets sit open for weeks because the person who submitted it went on
          holiday or &quot;didn't have time&quot; to respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your support ticket is in progress, you'll almost always see
          faster response times than when you submit a new ticket. Take
          advantage of it and respond as quickly as possible. The sooner you get
          back to them, the sooner they can get back to you.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          If you're having a problem with software or a web app, tell the
          support team what operating system and version you're running. When
          applicable, do the same for your web browser. You'd be surprised how
          many times simply knowing this would have let me close out tickets on
          the first interaction. Many web apps include this information in their
          error reporting or ticketing systems—but it still doesn't hurt to
          provide it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't know what operating system or browser you're using, you
          can find out by
          <a href="https://www.whatismybrowser.com/">going here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're submitting an issue about a web app, keep in mind that
          browser plugins and add-ons can cause mysterious things to happen.
          I've seen all sorts of seemingly unrelated things happen as a result
          of third-party plugins. Try disabling them before submitting a support
          ticket, or at least let the support person know which ones you have
          installed in case there's a known issue.
        </p>
        <h2 id="don't-paste-in-huge-amounts-of-text">

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is especially true if you're a developer. Don't paste in a
          megabyte of code or text to &quot;show&quot; support. It just makes
          the ticket harder to read. I get a certain tingling in my hand when I
          open a ticket that does this and it makes me want to skip forward to
          the next one. Please, for the love of everything sacred, use a service
          like <a href="http://pastebin.com/">PasteBin</a>. If you don't want
          the information to be public, create a secure link using
          <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> or even send it as an
          email attachment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever you do, don't start pasting globs of text into your support
          ticket. Keep the message area to a minimum and link to or attach
          supplemental information as needed.
        </p>

          Know when to mark things as &quot;urgent&quot;

            >#</a
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's true. Not every issue you submit to support is urgent, so think
          twice before you check that box or litter the subject line with words
          like &quot;critical&quot; and &quot;important.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          So when exactly is something urgent? It really depends on your
          circumstance. I have a user who puts &quot;urgent&quot; on pretty much
          every support ticket he opens up, and I would seldom consider any of
          his requests to be urgent. They're urgent to him, but to nobody else.
          This desensitizes the word whenever I see it attached to one of his
          tickets. Remember the boy who cried wolf?
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it like this. If you're looking out your living room window
          and see a suspicious person walking down the street, you'd call the
          local police to give them a heads up (not urgent). But if you're
          looking out that same window and see a suspicious person breaking into
          your neighbor's house, you'd call 911 (urgent).
        </p>
        <p>
          Is your issue worth dialing your support team's 911 hotline? If so,
          it's probably urgent.
        </p>
        <h2 id="don't-email-your-password">
          Don't email your password
          <a class="direct-link" href="#don't-email-your-password">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A support person should never ask you for your password. They have
          ways of accessing your account securely without having you send your
          login credentials through a ticket system or email. Don't volunteer it
          to them, either, because every time they hit &quot;reply&quot; or
          &quot;forward&quot; your password might be getting sent across the
          Internet in plain-text.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, like Media Temple, you'll need to generate a support
          pin to verify ownership of your account before calling. That's fine,
          because the pin is time-sensitive and can only be generated by you.
          However, they will never ask for your password in a support ticket or
          email.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven't already, you should probably train your brain to throw
          a red flag whenever anyone asks you for your password.
        </p>
        <h2 id="be-patient">
          Be patient <a class="direct-link" href="#be-patient">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Last but not least, give the support team time to respond. One of my
          services promises a 24-hour response time—and we deliver on that 99.9%
          of the time. That's not an easy feat for a bootstrapped company
          serving users all over the world, but it doesn't stop people from
          submitting multiple requests, often less than a couple hours apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to have patience. Don't submit a ticket and immediately jump
          on Facebook, Twitter, and every other platform you can find to submit
          the same request. It's rude, it's annoying, and it requires more time
          for support to respond. It can also confuse teams who manage support
          differently through various channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, you're speaking with real people out there. Even though
          support issues can be difficult and frustrating, keep your cool, be
          responsive, and be polite. I promise, you'll get much better support
          that way!
