        <h1>I should have been asking my users this from the start</h1>

        <div class="post-date">
          <time datetime="2015-01-20"> January 20, 2015 </time>

        <p>
          Feedback is critical to an app's success. How will you know what to
          fix or improve on if your users don't tell you? It seems obvious, but
          here is something I should have been asking my users from the start.
        </p>
        <h2 id="getting-the-right-feedback-is-critical">
          Getting the right feedback is critical
          <a class="direct-link" href="#getting-the-right-feedback-is-critical"
            >#</a
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          When someone signs up for my service, they get a nice welcome message
          that thanks them for signing up and shows them how to login. Inside
          that message, there's also a line that reads something like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If you have any questions or suggestions, hit <em>reply</em> and let
            us know!
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This lets people know that we're open to suggestions (which should be
          a given for a SaaS app), but it really doesn't produce a lot of useful
          feedback. I think people are desensitized by lines like that, but the
          message feels a lot less friendly without it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also send follow up emails after a couple days. I'm not trying to
          sell them something at this point—I'm trying to see if they're having
          trouble with the app or if they have any questions or feedback for me.
          This tends to yield a better response, especially when I ask about the
          user's business and what they expect from my service.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the single most important piece of feedback is something that
          I didn't start collecting until a few days ago.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-simple-oversight">
          A simple oversight
          <a class="direct-link" href="#a-simple-oversight">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          In my app, users can cancel their subscription or delete their account
          on their own—no need to email in a request. I do this because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I don't believe in retention via guilt (i.e. begging users to give
            it another try)
          </li>
          <li>It's more convenient for them</li>
          <li>It's less to manage for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But what I was missing out on is the feedback that comes from when a
          user decides to cancel or delete his account. This is very, very
          important for a SaaS company. How in the world was I not collecting
          this data?
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is I was trying, but I was going about it all wrong. For
          awhile now, whenever somebody canceled or deleted their account, the
          app would send me an email so I could follow up with them to find out
          why. I thought this would be more personal, as every message I typed
          was by hand. I almost never got responses to those emails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, that's probably because those users had already
          disconnected from the service. By the time they received my email,
          they had already moved on and didn't want to waste anymore of their
          time on it. It was simply too little, too late.
        </p>
        <h1 id="a-better-way-to-ask-users">
          A better way to ask users
          <a class="direct-link" href="#a-better-way-to-ask-users">#</a>
        </h1>
        <p>
          It became obvious that I needed to find a better way to ask users for
          their feedback <em>before</em> they canceled their accounts. So I
          recently took some time and added a simple text field to the
          cancel/delete screens. Not a dropdown menu, not radio buttons—just a
          simple textbox where they can leave one word or 1,000 words. By
          reaching out to users who are in the process of canceling, I've found
          that they're much more likely to voice their reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I've made that simple change, I went from almost zero feedback
          to <em>all but one user</em> telling me why they decided to cancel.
          (For what it's worth, the person who didn't leave a reason had only
          signed up a few minutes prior to canceling the account—probably just a
          window shopper.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though it's only been a few days, I've learned a lot about why
          users decide to cancel their accounts. It gives me a better
          understanding of how they work, how they think, and what they expect,
          and it gives them a chance to have their voices heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I found was a better way to ask my users for feedback. It's so
          ridiculously simple. I just wish I'd thought to do it years ago.
        </p>
