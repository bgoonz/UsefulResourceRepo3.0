        <h1>I switched from tabs to spaces and haven&#39;t looked back</h1>

        <p>
          Last week I started using spaces to indent code instead of tabs. It's
          something I swore I would never do, but I'm glad I finally did.
        </p>
        <h2 id="why-i-always-preferred-tabs">
          Why I always preferred tabs
          <a class="direct-link" href="#why-i-always-preferred-tabs">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Tabs are sensible. They were made to indent things, and code needs to
          be indented, so it was a good relationship. Probably the two most
          well-known arguments for using tabs are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tabs reduce file size (although this is negligible and I would never
            argue based on this point)
          </li>
          <li>
            Tabs allow each developers to choose their own indentation level
            without changing the actual file (this was always my biggest reason,
            and I think most pro-tab people agree)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Of course, there are more arguments (and plenty for spaces too), but
          here's why <em>I've</em> switched.
        </p>
        <h2 id="soft-tabs-make-it-seamless">
          Soft tabs make it seamless
          <a class="direct-link" href="#soft-tabs-make-it-seamless">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most editors support soft tabs, which means you can still use the tab
          key to indent/outdent and never even notice the difference. Sublime
          Text 3 is my editor of choice, and it does a superb job of this. It
          also has some built in tools for converting between tabs and spaces,
          reindenting, etc. That made it a lot easier for me to switch and
          update existing files.
        </p>
        <p>
          And when I &quot;seamless&quot;, it really has been. I've been a
          stubborn tab guy for like a decade. My workflow hasn't changed, the
          keystrokes I use are identical, the code looks the same, and the
          universe hasn't imploded yet. That's a good sign for my first week.
        </p>
        <h2 id="indentation-is-always-consistent">
          Indentation is always consistent
          <a class="direct-link" href="#indentation-is-always-consistent">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          One thing that always drove me crazy about using tabs was the way HTML
          looks when you view the source. Most browsers render tabs the
          equivalent of eight or more spaces long. Why they do this, I'll never
          know. But I do know that I don't have to worry about that anymore. +1
          for spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other places where indentation varies. In fact, the biggest
          pro-tab argument ends up being an argument <em>against</em> tabs when
          you don't have control over how deep indentations go.
        </p>
        <h2 id="everyone-uses-them-now">
          Everyone uses them now
          <a class="direct-link" href="#everyone-uses-them-now">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is massively popular,
          and for a good reason. It cuts out the fat and gives you something
          tried and tested to develop with. It's a solid framework, and the
          conventions they use make really good sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when Mark Otto (probably best known as
          <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>) released his
          <a href="http://codeguide.co/">code guide</a>, it of course suggested
          we use soft tabs (spaces). Another hard blow to tab lovers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's the thing—I normally wouldn't sway and I'd keep doing my own
          thing code rogue style, but what's the point? If you've ever been on
          GitHub, it's clear that most developers are using spaces now. As tab
          lovers, we're pissing into the wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          So last week I decided to try out spaces while building
          <a href="http://www.particle.software/">Particle</a>. I converted all
          files from tabs to spaces in less than five minutes and just went with
          it. And I actually liked it. A lot.
        </p>
        <h2 id="my-code-fits-in-now">
          My code fits in now
          <a class="direct-link" href="#my-code-fits-in-now">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's refreshing to know that my code fits in better with other
          people's code now. I don't have to worry about what other developers
          and projects are using, because most of them are using spaces anyway.
          I also don't have to worry about contributing to a project and
          accidentally sending commits with a mix of tabs and spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Call it peer pressure. Call it giving up on my beloved tabs. I really
          don't care anymore. At the end of the day, I looked past an old habit
          and, for whatever reason, I decided to try something new.
        </p>
        <p>I switched from tabs to spaces and haven't looked back.</p>
