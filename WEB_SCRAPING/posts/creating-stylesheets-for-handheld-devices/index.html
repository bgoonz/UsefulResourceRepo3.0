          It's not uncommon so see someone surfing the net with their cell phone
          or PDA these days or, at least, trying to. Unfortunately, portable
          technologies still have a long way to go before they conquer the web
          with their tiny screens. The good news is that, with a little help
          from stylesheets, your website can look presentable even in the palm
          of somebody's hand!
        </p>
        <h2 id="handheld-stylesheets">
          Handheld stylesheets
          <a class="direct-link" href="#handheld-stylesheets">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Similar to the way that
          <a href="http://abeautifulsite.net/notebook.php?article=16"
            >print stylesheets</a
          >
          make your webpages ready for paper, handheld stylesheets make your
          webpages ready for portable devices. This is often necessary due to
          the fact that most websites aren't designed for small screens.
          Fortunately, with a little extra effort, this obstacle is easy to
          overcome.

        </h3>
        <p>
          We start off by linking to what will become our handheld stylesheet:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link href=&quot;your_handheld_style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;handheld&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Notice how the <code>media</code> attribute is set to
          <code>handheld</code> instead of <code>screen</code>.<br />
          Now it's time to create <code>your_handheld_style.css</code>.
        </p>

          Creating the handheld stylesheet
          <a class="direct-link" href="#creating-the-handheld-stylesheet">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You could use the normal screen stylesheet as a starting point to make
          your handheld stylesheet. Depending on the complexity of the CSS, it
          may be better to start from scratch or just copy and paste one section
          at a time, modifying the styles little by little and testing as you
          go. You could even choose to make a completely different look and feel
          for the handheld version of your website. The key thing to remember
          here is that you're creating a design that is meant to display on
          small screens, often no larger than 240x320 pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which ever route you take, the fact that you will eventually need to
          preview the &quot;portable&quot; version of your website is
          inescapable...but what if you don't have a handheld device?
        </p>

          Testing the handheld stylesheet without a handheld device

        </h3>
        <p>
          There are a lot of features I really love about
          <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, one of them being the
          <em>Small screen</em> feature. By clicking on <code>View</code> →
          <code>Small screen</code> or by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> +
          <kbd>F11</kbd>, you can preview any website in a simulated
          &quot;handheld&quot; mode. This is usually how I test my handheld
          stylesheets when I don't have a portable device laying around:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/opera_small_screen.jpg"
            alt="Opera small screen"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          During testing in <em>Small screen</em> mode, it may be helpful to add
          the following code to your stylesheet. This will simulate the screen
          width of many common portable devices. Just remember to remove it
          before you upload!
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">html {
  width: 240px;
  border: solid 1px #000000;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Another thing I would recommend using in your handheld stylesheet is
          this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">* { max-width: 100%; }
</code></pre>
        <p>
          This will prevent elements such as images and textareas from exceeding
          the width of the device's screen.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Another method to test your handheld stylesheet is with
          <a href="http://www.operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a>. The program itself
          requires a mobile phone, but no worries! There's also an
          <a href="http://www.operamini.com/demo/?url=http://abeautifulsite.net"
            >online simulator</a

          you can try out on any website. Here is what A Beautiful Site looks
          like on it:

          A note about handheld stylesheets
          <a class="direct-link" href="#a-note-about-handheld-stylesheets">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          An important thing to remember while you're coding up a handheld
          stylesheet is the fact that most handhelds <em>will not</em> display
          your site exactly the way you intend them to. It sounds kind of ironic
          that you just spent the time writing up a completely different
          stylesheet just to find out that it's not going to work on the media
          you intended it to work on. Well, all is not lost. Let me explain...
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to hardware and software limitations, most handheld devices are
          designed to display certain elements of webpages in ways that work for
          both the device and the user. For example, it wouldn't be of much use
          if a PDA with a screen resolution of 240x320 pixels displayed a
          full-size image that was 800x600 pixels. In most cases, the device
          will automatically scale the image down so the entire image can be
          viewed. Similar adjustments are made to text, links, form elements,
          floated elements, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what good is a handheld stylesheet if they aren't really supported?
          Well, they provide a foundation for the design which you
          <em>intend</em> the portable version of your website to have. Not only
          that, support for handheld stylesheets is growing rapidly as
          technology advances. For the little time and effort they actually
          require to produce, I'd say they're worth the effort.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-if-i-don't-have-a-handheld-stylesheet%3F">
          What if I don't have a handheld stylesheet?
          <a
            class="direct-link"
            href="#what-if-i-don't-have-a-handheld-stylesheet%3F"
            >#</a
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          A good question indeed. Most portable browsers will either make a good
          attempt at using your normal stylesheet or ditch the styles
          altogether. The benefit of using handheld stylesheets is that you are,
          to some extent, guaranteed your website will reflect at least a little
          bit of the design which you intended.
        </p>

          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some portable browsers, such as Opera Mini and Apple's anticipated
          iPhone version of Safari, do a fairly good job of rendering websites
          based on their default screen styles. Aside from the low resolutions
          that portable devices commonly suffer, it makes me wonder if handheld
          stylesheets will even be necessary in years to come. Since the path is
          still unclear, however, it can't really hurt to have them.
