        <p>
          The word &quot;startup&quot; has taken on a very unfortunate meaning
          over the years. I used to think of my own business as a startup, but
          as its definition evolved, I quickly realized I didn't fit that
          description at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word &quot;startup&quot;, by definition, means the act or instance
          of setting in operation or motion. Or, more appropriately, a fledgling
          business enterprise. Given that, you could assume that just about any
          up and coming business is, in fact, a startup. But you'd be wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          What it means today<br />
          While the definition will vary from entrepreneur to investor, there's
          one thing that most startups have in common these days: many seem to
          be in it for the money. You see, we're in the middle of a
          <a
            href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/24/facebook-apple-google-and-the-tech-startup-gold-rush"
            >gold rush</a
          >, and everybody wants a piece of the pie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in the day, running a startup meant that you shared a certain
          passion and solved a certain problem. It was a culture, one that you
          submitted to because you wanted to make the world a better place. When
          you were a startup founder, the last thing on your mind was an exit
          strategy. Hell,
          <a
            href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3032341/most-creative-people/this-startup-had-over-5-million-users-and-a-great-product-then-it-folde"
            >some didn't even have a monetization strategy</a
          >. You just wanted to build something awesome and feel good knowing
          people used your product.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's not to say that making money isn't important—after all, you
          have to eventually monetize to stay in business—but sustainability is
          very different than superabundance. The problem now is that most
          people are taking that million dollar shot. They care less about what
          they're building, more about how they're going to get rich, and
          they're indifferent to the quality of their product.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can thank acquisitions like the
          <a
            href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-09/facebook-snaps-up-instagram"
            >$1 billion Instagram deal</a
          >
          or the absurdly high
          <a
            href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-19/facebook-acquires-whatsapp-for-19-billion"
            >$19 billion WhatsApp purchase</a
          >. Big companies are buying up products and services like they're
          going out of style, and each high-dollar acquisition just adds fuel to
          the fire. The idea of becoming a millionaire is poisoning the startup
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, &quot;startup&quot; has become synonymous with a business
          whose primary goal is to make a bunch of money through investments,
          acquisitions, or the holy IPO grail. They're like the new
          get-rich-quick schemes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why I'm taking it back<br />
          While my company doesn't share the same traits as those above, I
          always considered it to be a startup. I bootstrapped it back in 2007
          and, to this day, I haven't taken investments of any kind. To me,
          that's one of the most beautiful things about the startup world. You
          can create something from virtually nothing and, the next thing you
          know, you're running a profitable business.
        </p>
        <p>
          What starts as an idea evolves into a product or service, and it's
          made great by the passion you have for building it. But when you start
          thinking more about the money than the experience, you end up adding
          to the landfill of half-hearted products that nobody ever wanted. If
          you have an exit strategy before you have an idea, you're doing it for
          the wrong reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, this issue came to light a few years ago when someone made me
          feel very ignorant for calling my own business a startup.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            You run a startup? Who have you pitched your idea to? How much are
            you seeking for investment? What's your exit strategy?
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          None of it applied to me, but the questions were asked with such
          certainty that it felt like they should have. That's become the
          expectation for startups these days. After I explained that I wasn't
          doing any of that, he responded with:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Oh, so you're not a startup. You're a bootstrapper.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Suddenly, my product wasn't interesting because I didn't plan on
          getting acquired or raising millions of dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          In hindsight, I should have corrected him. You see, I've come to
          realize that it's not my version of &quot;startup&quot; that's been
          skewed. It's those that think startups have only one purpose—to
          generate multi-million dollar payouts—who are getting it wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          A startup isn't a wealth generator. Yes, one of their functions is to
          sustain a business financially, but that's not the reason you should
          be in the game. A startup is an idea. It's a passion. It's a culture.
          It's a business that aspires to make the world better, no matter how
          large or small.
        </p>
        <p>
          From now on, when you hear me talk about startups, don't be confused
          by the people who are starting up just to cash out. Know that when I
          use the &quot;s&quot; word, I'm referring to those who are doing what
          they love for reasons that amount to much more than just dollar signs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm drilling a new well. I'm tossing out the trash. I'm taking
          &quot;startup&quot; back.
