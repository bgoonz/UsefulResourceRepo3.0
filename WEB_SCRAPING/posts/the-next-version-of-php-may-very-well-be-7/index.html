  <p>We've been hearing about PHP 6 since 2005, but nothing has been brought to fruition yet. In fact, the project was so plagued with problems that in 2010, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9222419/PHP_5.4_emerges_with_best_of_abandoned_PHP_6.0">it was abandoned</a>. It almost felt like PHP would be perpetually stuck at version 5.</p>
<p>Except now there's talk about another major release. It could be PHP 6, or maybe PHP 7. Between developers, there's <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php6">a hot debate</a> over what the next major PHP release will be called.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason why this question even comes up, is that there has been a previous attempt at a new major version, which was started in 2005 and abandoned in 2010 due to difficulties in the Unicode implementation. Apart from language-integrated Unicode support, most features added for that version were integrated either in PHP 5.3 or PHP 5.4.</p>
<p>This previous attempt at a new major version was also developed under the name of PHP 6 and as such there are various resources referring to it, including a number of books. There is concern that there might be confusion between the abandoned previous attempt and the work that is currently happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're not familiar with what happened with the original PHP 6, you can read more its unfortunate demise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#PHP_6_and_Unicode">here</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the entire Internet was anticipating a PHP version that will never actually ship, it's probably better to stick with PHP 7.</p>
