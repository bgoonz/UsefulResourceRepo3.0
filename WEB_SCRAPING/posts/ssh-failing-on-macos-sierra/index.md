# SSH failing on macOS Sierra

January 15, 2017 â€¢ 1 min read

For me, upgrading to MacOS Sierra broke a lot of things that use SSH, including Transmit, Sequel Pro, and a handful of other apps. In fact, it seems to break any appÂ that uses an SSH key with a passphrase. ðŸ¤”

The solution I found was to tell SSH to use the MacOS keychain. Simply edit `~/.ssh/config`Â and add the following (you can safely create the file if it doesn't exist):

    Host *
    Â  Â  UseKeychain yes

That's it! I didn't even have to restart SSHÂ and everything is connecting fine again. ðŸ’ª
