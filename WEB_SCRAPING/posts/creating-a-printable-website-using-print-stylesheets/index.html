            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please

          I frequently see little printer icons all over the web that clearly
          mean I can print out a clean version of the webpage that I'm looking
          at. These little icons are indeed a beautiful sight from the user's
          perspective. No more having to modify printer settings or copy and
          paste certain content areas into a word processing program just to get
          it on paper. In fact, I used to be quite the fan of printable versions
          on the web until I realized what a pain it can be to develop them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One method I've seen involves creating a separate version of each page
          that doesn't have the header, footer, and navigational elements. By
          doing this, one could nearly double the size of their website without
          even trying, and who knows how many people are actually going to print
          all those pages. It seems like a wasted effort, if you ask me.
        </p>
        <p>
          A somewhat better method that a lot of database-driven websites use is
          to create a separate version of the content dynamically. This involves
          using a special page to generate a printable version of the content,
          again without the header, footer, and navigational elements. This is a
          lot better because it doesn't involve duplicating content on extra,
          unnecessary webpages. It still requires, however, extra effort to
          develop that special page to render the printable content; and who's
          to say that all the data is coming from just one table in the
          database? Another potential development nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add insult to injury, both of the aforementioned methods result in
          the user dealing with an annoying pop-up window or being redirected to
          the printable version of the page. Oftentimes I thought to myself,
          &quot;why can't I just hit CTRL+P and print this?&quot; That would be
          the ultimate user experience. After all, if nothing else is consistent
          in web browsers it's the ability to click on
          <code>File | Print</code> to print a webpage. &quot;This has to be
          possible&quot;, I thought. There must be a way to prevent content from
          printing like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/no_print_styles_example.jpg"

        </p>
        <h2 id="enter-print-stylesheets">
          Enter print stylesheets
          <a class="direct-link" href="#enter-print-stylesheets">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          With the web standards revolution going at full force, more and more
          people are understanding the need for semantic markup and stylesheets.
          The benefits are many compared to what little old-fashioned
          development techniques have to offer. In fact, there are
          <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=the+benefits+of+web+standards"
            >millions of articles</a
          >
          on the web that outline the very benefits I'm referring to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article will cover one aspect of standard CSS that is becoming
          more and more popular in everyday development practice: print
          stylesheets.
        </p>
        <h2 id="a-new-way-of-printing">
          A new way of printing
          <a class="direct-link" href="#a-new-way-of-printing">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I began developing A Beautiful Site's Notebook, one of the things
          I really wanted people to be able to do was print the articles. After
          all, what good is an article if you can't print it out and take it
          with you? Another thing I wanted was for the printouts to look clean
          and professional, which is what I ultimately achieved. If you don't
          believe me, print this page and see for yourself. I think the before
          &amp; after results are rather convincing:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/print_stylesheets_sample.jpg"
            alt="Example with print styles"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice how the version without print styles has the website title,
          navigation menu, and sidebar content cluttering up the first half of
          the page? In the styled version, these elements are removed and the
          page almost looks as if it were printed from a word processing
          program. The font styles and sizes still match that of the original
          design, with one exception: I decided to style the main text as
          <code>Times New Roman</code>, since serif fonts are easier to read on
          printed media. Most books and magazines use this style of font, so it
          should give readers a more comfortable feeling when reading the
          article on paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that, compared to the previous examples, the non-styled version
          of A Beautiful Site's webpages are still clean and easy to read. One
          of the benefits of using semantic markup means that, print styles or
          not, your pages will be more legible when they come out of the
          printer.
        </p>
        <h2 id="minimal-effort">

        <h3 id="linking-the-print-stylesheet">
          Linking the print stylesheet

        </h3>
        <p>
          It really doesn't take much time and effort to apply this technology
          to your website. In fact, all you need to do is create an additional
          stylesheet and link each page to it. I typically add this line
          directly below the normal stylesheet link:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link href=&quot;your_print_style.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;print&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Notice that the <code>media</code> attribute is set to
          <code>print</code> instead of <code>screen</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was easy, now we need to create
          <code>your_print_style.css</code>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="creating-the-print-stylesheet">
          Creating the print stylesheet
          <a class="direct-link" href="#creating-the-print-stylesheet">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You could simply start from scratch and attempt to recreate the entire
          look and feel of your site in a printable version. Considering the
          amount of time it would probably take to do this, it seems rather
          silly to start from the ground up. My technique for creating print
          stylesheets is much faster and easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I copy the normal stylesheet to the new stylesheet. That's
          right, <code>select all</code> â†’ <code>copy</code> â†’
          <code>paste</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, I decide which elements I <em>don't</em> want to appear on the
          printed version. For this example, let's pretend we have the following
          elements: <code>header</code>, <code>nav-menu</code>,
          <code>sidebar</code>, <code>content</code>, and <code>footer</code>.
          The only essential element for the printed version will be
          <code>content</code>, which contains the information that the user is
          actually trying to print.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I disable all of the unnecessary elements from appearing using
          standard CSS:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">#header,
#nav-menu,
#sidebar,
#footer {
  display: none;
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Note: To avoid confusion, it's a good idea to delete or comment-out
          the old CSS that affects these elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final step is to remove any styles that apply to the
          <code>content</code> element that may affect the way it appears in the
          printed version. This may include paddings, margins, borders, or
          anything else that hinders the appearance. If you're using a
          sans-serif font, you may also wish to style the main text as a serif
          font, as I did above.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-final-design">
          The final design <a class="direct-link" href="#the-final-design">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can preview your design without having to print it out using the
          <code>Print Preview</code> feature in your browser. As with normal
          stylesheets, feel free to make any adjustments to your print
          stylesheet to optimize the appearance of the design. Now that you have
          beautiful, no-hassle, printed versions of your webpages, your users
          will thank you.
