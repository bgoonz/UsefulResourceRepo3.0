            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please
            keep this in mind as you're reading.

          Ever since tabbed browsing hit the mainstream I've been hooked. It's
          rare to see less than a handful of tabs open in my web browser at any
          time. Whether I'm developing, checking email, or just surfing around,
          I can never seem to have enough tabs! But there's one thing about this
          incredible feature that has really bugged me since Day One — one that
          seems to have gone completely unnoticed by all of the browser makers
          to-date.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Why can't I see my homepage when I open a new tab?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It may seem trivial or silly to complain about, but to me the idea of
          anything but my homepage opening in a new tab is counterintuitive. For
          example, if you open a brand new browser window what do you expect to
          see? Your homepage. If you open any browser (before Safari 4, Opera
          9.2, and Google Chrome) what do you expect to see? Your homepage.
        </p>
        <p>
          People generally know what to do when they see their homepage because
          it's familiar to them. Most of them know how to use the address bar to
          go to another website. Many of them know how to choose a bookmark to
          quickly get to their favorite places on the web. For the majority of
          people, having their homepage open up in a new tab is simply what they
          subconsciously expect to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragedy here is that this isn't currently possible in any browser
          without the use of a
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/777"
            >plug-in</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems as though browser makers each have their own perspective on
          what should happen when a new tab is opened. Internet Explorer 8, for
          example, likes to confuse its users with a mostly empty page to stare
          at. To spice it up a bit, Microsoft decided to add some infrequently
          used options that users can click on. How many times have you opened
          up a new tab because you wanted to &quot;Blog with Windows Live&quot;
          or &quot;Map [something] with Live Search&quot;? How about &quot;Show
          copied text&quot;?
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="../../images/ie8-new-tab.gif" alt="New tab view in IE8" />
        </p>
        <p>
          These are clearly not options that are useful to users, but
          considering how well they promote Microsoft's services, I can
          understand how they got there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firefox is my browser of choice for both development and day-to-day
          browsing, but sadly, it doesn't do much better than IE when it comes
          to new tabs. In fact, I think it does even worse in comparison with
          IE8. It's a completely blank page.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/firefox-new-tab.gif"
            alt="New tab view in Firefox"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          If I'm not mistaken, Opera was the first to come out with the
          &quot;smart page&quot; when they introduced
          <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Speed_Dial"
            >Speed-Dial</a
          >
          in 9.2. Speed Dial allows users to specify up to nine websites from
          their bookmarks that will appear in a grid for easy access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/opera-new-tab.gif"
            alt="New tab view in Opera"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't long before other browser makers started trying out their
          own versions of smart pages. Google Chrome made their smart page more
          useful by adding a search bar, recent bookmarks, and recently closed
          tabs. As far as smart pages go, this is probably the best of the bunch
          for functionality, although the nine websites that are automatically
          chosen aren't always relevant to your actual use of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/chrome-new-tab.gif"
            alt="New tab view in Chrome"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Safari 4 introduced a really slick &quot;Top Sites&quot;
          smart page that works pretty well. And, as usual with Apple products,
          it looks great. The only problem is that it's a little too flashy
          where it should be more functional. For example, click on the Search
          History box. The page is instantly replaced by a huge, side-scrolling
          list of websites. Sure it looks nice at first, but as I search through
          possible results, I can only see one at a time and it's very jumpy
          during transitions. I prefer Firefox's searchable history over this
          any day.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          So where do we go from here? Will the world stop because we can't open
          new tabs and see our homepages? Of course not. It hasn't yet, and
          we've been dealing with it for years. But why? To me, this seems like
          a no-brainer that should have made the top of the list for possible
          &quot;new tab candidates&quot;. At the very least, I'd like to see the
          browser makers add this in as an option somewhere.
