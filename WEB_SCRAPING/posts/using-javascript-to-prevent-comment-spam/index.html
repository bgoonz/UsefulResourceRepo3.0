            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please
            keep this in mind as you're reading.

          Comment spam (also known as 'link spam', 'blog spam', and 'wikispam')
          occurs when people or spam bots post comments on someones blog,
          guestbook, or wiki for the sole purpose of boosting traffic and
          promoting better search engine rankings for their site. Like email
          spam, it can be particularly annoying and troublesome to deal with.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          Many companies and organizations have put forth efforts to prevent
          comment spam. The well-known search engine
          <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a>, who owns the popular blog
          site <a href="http://blogger.com/">Blogger</a>,
          <a
            href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html"
            >announced back in 2005</a
          >
          that it would no longer index anchor tags with the
          <code>rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;</code> attribute in them. Web
          developers were encouraged to make their software automatically add
          this attribute to all user-contributed hyperlinks. Although this
          method will discourage a lot of spammers from wasting their time, it
          doesn't actually prevent them from posting spam comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other efforts to combat comment spam focus on the fact that most
          spammers use automated scripts to submit their messages. These scripts
          work very much like traditional spam bots but, rather than harvesting
          email addresses, they target comment forms. Once spammers have a list
          of comment forms and know the fields that each one asks for, they can
          use programs like <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> to forge
          comment submissions. This is an effective way to spam many blogs in a
          short period of time, so it's used quite commonly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A reasonably good method of preventing this type of spam is called
          <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">CAPTCHA</a>. CAPTCHA typically
          displays an image of a word or phrase with obscured lettering that OCR
          scanners can't read. This means that, to successfully submit a
          comment, the user has to provide the correct response to the CAPTCHA
          test. Since a human is typically required to pass the test, spam bots
          can't post bogus comments to sites that use this technology.
          Unfortunately, this method requires users to take additional steps in
          order to post comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, you could require that all comments be approved before they
          are posted, but that requires a lot of extra time and effort,
          especially for busy sites.
        </p>

          A Better Method?
          <a class="direct-link" href="#a-better-method%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I've decided to share a method that I've been using on
          <a href="http://laviska.com/">my personal site</a> for a few years
          now. I used to get lots of guestbook and comment spam on a daily basis
          when my forms were left wide open. Since I've applied this technique,
          I haven't recieved any comment spam at all. That's right,
          <em>not one</em>. Of course, once I post this there will be nothing
          stopping spammers from tweaking their bots to work around this
          solution. At least, for now, it works extremely well.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-it-works">
          How it works <a class="direct-link" href="#how-it-works">#</a>
        </h3>
        <p>It's really quite simple. You start with a basic comment form:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;form id=&quot;comment-form&quot; action=&quot;add-comment.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  [other input fields here]
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Post Comment&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Now, to prevent comment spammers, we make a few basic adjustments:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;form id=&quot;comment-form&quot; action=&quot;NO-BLOG-SPAM.PHP&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  [other input fields here]
  &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Post Comment&quot; onclick=&quot;submitCommentForm();&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Notice I changed the form <code>action</code> to
          <code>NO-BLOG-SPAM.PHP</code>. This could be anything, really, as long
          as it's not a valid page. Next, I changed the submit button to a
          regular button and added a JavaScript <code>onclick</code> event. I'll
          show you the <code>submitCommentForm()</code> function in a minute.
          First, I want to explain my reasoning for doing all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          It makes sense to me to have a bogus <code>action</code> so that, when
          a spam bot indexes the form information, it is indexing a submission
          page that doesn't exist. If the spammer was trying to use curl to
          submit the comment, they would receive a 'Page Does Not Exist' error.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also makes sense to me to change the submit button to a regular
          button. If the spam bot is trying to submit the form from the within
          the page, it won't know which field triggers the submission. In fact,
          it would have to be smart enough to follow the JavaScript events for
          every form element that has one (which, in our case, is only one).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, here's the <code>submitCommentForm()</code> function. Note that I
          am including this function from a separate file, which means the spam
          bot would not only have to be able to follow the JavaScript, but also
          support including scripts from other parts of the page.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">function submitCommentForm() {
  // Change the form action to the real submission page
  document.getElementById('comment-form').action = &quot;add-comment.php&quot;;

  // Submit the form
  document.getElementById('comment-form').submit();
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
          As you can see, the when the user clicks on the button labeled 'Post
          Comment', the <code>submitCommentForm()</code> function is triggered.
          This changes the form <code>action</code> to the real submission page,
          allowing the user's submission to post. Of course, this still won't
          prevent a real human from submitting comment spam, but humans aren't
          usually into wasting countless hours of their time typing in comment
          spam. As I stated before, this method has prevented automated comment
          spam on my personal site for well over two years.
