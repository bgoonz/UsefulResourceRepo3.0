Getting it right
================

January 14, 2017 • 1 min read

To my awesome users:

I've been taking some time to reimagine what Postleaf should have been. Yes, the betas were pretty awesome, but they weren't what I wanted them to be in terms of design, code, and function. I can do better, and you deserve nothing less than my very best.

The last few months were difficult for me as I struggled to find my place in the world of content management. I thought about giving it up and getting out of software altogether. My vision was cloudy, my passion had faded. Recently, I looked at Postleaf from a completely different perspective and everything started to make sense again.

*I have a vision to bring simple, beautiful publishing to the world. And I'm not going to stop until I get it right.*

Thanks for giving me the time I needed to find myself.

Postleaf will be back very soon. And it will be better than you ever imagined.
