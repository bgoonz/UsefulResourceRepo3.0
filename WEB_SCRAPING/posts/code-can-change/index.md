Code can change
===============

May 10, 2016 • 1 min read

As a web developer, your code is often visible to anyone who wants to review it. If you're like me, you might get stressed out about the thought of people looking at your work and critiquing or criticizing your app's design.

Take a deep breath, recenter, and remember that code can always change. That's why we have version numbers!

Even the most seasoned developers have their own opinion of what "good design" is. No matter how long you spend engineering or reworking your app's design, there's always, always, always going to be more ways to improve it. In fact, the code you write today will probably look like crap to you a year from now. That's part of the learning process.

Remember, code is dynamic. It's meant to change. So don't obsess about making it perfect. Just make it work, make it easy to understand, and realize you'll probably be changing it one day.
