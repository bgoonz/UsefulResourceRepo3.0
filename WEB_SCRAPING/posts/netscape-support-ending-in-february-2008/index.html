            Heads up! This post was written in 2008, so it may contain
            information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this
            around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please
            keep this in mind as you're reading.

          On December 28th, 2007, the
          <a href="http://blog.netscape.com/">Netscape Blog</a> announced that
          AOL is
          <a
            href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers/"
            >ending support for Netscape web browsers</a
          >
          effective February 1, 2008. This doesn't come as much of a surprise,
          considering the significant decline in Netscape's marketshare over the
          past decade to more competative browsers such as IE, Firefox, Opera,
          and Apple's Safari. Nevertheless, it is upsetting to see what was once
          the technical leader among web browsers become a thing of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Netscape has been Mozilla-based since version 6, AOL claims
          that their &quot;transition into an ad-supported web business leaves
          little room for the size of investment needed to get the Netscape
          browser to a point many of its fans expect it to be.&quot; Netscape
          users are being encouraged to migrate to
          <a href="http://firefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a>. Nostalgic Netscape
          users can download the
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/56836"
            >Netscape theme and extensions</a
          >
          for Firefox from the Mozilla website.

          A bit of history <a class="direct-link" href="#a-bit-of-history">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Netscape Navigator became extremely popular in the mid-1990's during
          the consumer Internet revolution. Their success was seen as a threat
          by Microsoft who promptly responded with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
          The two companies began an agile battle for marketshare that would
          eventually be coined the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Browser Wars</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time, the rival companies implemented a number of
          proprietary features in an effort to out perform each other and gain
          marketshare. Consequently, development was focused more on features
          than on bug fixes, security, and standardization which led to
          frustrating and confusing times for consumers and developers alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1998, as Internet Explorer grew increasingly more popular, Netscape
          released most of its source code under an open source license which
          became known as the
          <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Project</a>. After being
          purchased by AOL, Netscape released version 6.0 which was based on the
          Mozilla browser, but its success was minimal at best. Netscape
          continued to use the Mozilla framework through 2008, at which time it
          was officially discontinued.
