          In a world dominated by social media, it's natural to want visitors to
          share your content with friends and followers. This really isn't a bad
          thing, but how you go about encouraging them can actually be
          <em>discouraging</em>.

        <p>
          Six years ago, Twitter <em>wasn't</em> all over the news. Facebook had
          <em>just</em> opened itself up to any user over the age of 13. You
          didn't see social media logos on television commercials or on every
          box of cereal at the supermarket. The guy on the radio wasn't
          screaming at you to &quot;like&quot; this and that. Those were the
          good old days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, everyone from the kid next door to <a
            href="http://twitter.com/pontifex"
            >the pope</a
          >
          has a Twitter account. Major retailers and brands are reaching out to
          their customers through Facebook, providing them with offers and
          incentives faster than they ever could before. Companies are tackling
          customer support by responding within hours or even minutes to angry
          consumers who voice their opinions to the world. Social media is good
          stuff, and even our technophobic grandmothers are getting on board.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point is, everyone knows about social media now. It's built into
          our desktops, tablets, and phones. There are a multitude of apps that
          make posting content to your favorite service a breeze. So why are we
          still plastering &quot;share&quot; widgets all over our sites?
        </p>
        <p>
          I was recently speaking with a good friend of mine about this. We both
          have websites, and we both had those tacky, distracting
          &quot;share&quot; widgets on them at some point. We were social when
          social wasn't cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, it seems like every site we come across has some kind of
          obtrusive social-sharing widget included on every single page.
          <em>Share this, tweet that, blah, blah, blah</em>...it's just as
          distracting and tacky as a big ugly banner ad—and people become
          desensitized by that sort of thing.
        </p>
        <h2 id="it's-usually-not-worth-it">
          It's usually not worth it
          <a class="direct-link" href="#it's-usually-not-worth-it">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          That's a pretty bold statement, but let's use the very popular tech
          blog <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a> as an example.
          Mashable reaches out to tech nuts—people who use social media on an
          unhealthy basis. There's no shortage of social media sharing in
          Mashable's audience, so if anyone can pull this off, it would be them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering Mashable <a href="http://mashable.com/about/">boasts</a
          > 20 million monthly visitors (as well as six million social media
          followers), you'd think their &quot;share&quot; widgets would have
          staggering numbers. On the contrary, the average post only appears to
          get between 500 and 900 collective &quot;shares&quot; in its first 48
          hours of existence (an article's prime exposure period). Here's an
          example from an article posted a couple days ago:
        </p>
        <p><img src="../../images/404.html" alt="Mashable's share widget" /></p>
        <p>
          While it's impossible to determine the actual number of visits to each
          article on Mashable, it quickly becomes obvious that the percentage of
          visitors who bother sharing them is extremely low.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a news giant such as Mashable—who garners over 20 million visitors
          a month—can only pull in a few thousand shares per article, how many
          do you think your site will be able to pull in?
        </p>
        <h2 id="encourage-them-without-encouraging-them">
          Encourage them without encouraging them
          <a class="direct-link" href="#encourage-them-without-encouraging-them"
            >#</a
          >
        </h2>
        <p>
          So how do you encourage users to share your content without slapping
          an annoying badge or button on your site? The answer comes down to the
          most fundamental rule of successful bloggers:
        </p>
        <p><em>Post awesome stuff that people want to read!</em></p>
        <p>
          No matter how many &quot;like&quot; or &quot;share&quot; widgets you
          put on your page, if your content sucks, people aren't going to pass
          it along to their friends. But if your content is interesting, people
          will share it whether or not those widgets even exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think it's all about making it easier for users to share your
          content...think again. Social integration is built right into most
          devices these days. You can Tweet directly from the
          <a
            href="http://www.cultofmac.com/194772/enable-twitter-in-mountain-lion-notification-center-os-x-tips/"
            >Notification Center</a
          >
          in OS X. iOS has both
          <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/06/apple-twitter-ios5/"
            >Twitter</a
          >
          and
          <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/06/11/apple-facebook/">Facebook</a>
          integrated right into the operating system. Windows 8 connects with
          those and many more services through its
          <a
            href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2013554/windows-8-deep-dive-get-to-know-the-people-app.html"
            >People App</a
          >. And all of that goes without mentioning the
          <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/SOCIAL?feature=category-nav"
            >many</a

          <a
            href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios-social-networking/id6005?mt=8"
            >many</a
          >
          apps that are available on every platform to do the very same things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six years ago, when the average person had no idea what social media
          was, &quot;share&quot; widgets became a fad. Now, since social media
          is more than apparent in all our lives, they serve little more than to
          beg people to do something they would already have done if they really
          wanted to. Remember, quality is far more important than quantity when
          it comes to blogging. Besides, wouldn't you rather have people
          <em>want</em> to share your content instead of <em>begging</em> them
          to?
