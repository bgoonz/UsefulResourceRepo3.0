        <h1>Surreal CMS acquires PageLime</h1>

        <div class="post-date">

        <p>
          Nearly a decade ago, I launched my first SaaS application. It was a
          new take on content management — a hosted CMS that reads/writes
          directly to a web server and uses class attributes to define content
          regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a great idea. Such a great idea that it inspired others to do
          the same. One of those apps was called PageLime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've seen a number of similar services come and go,
          but PageLime came out swinging. These guys had tons of energy. Hell,
          they even managed to get
          <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/12/31/pagelime-cms/"
            >featured by Mashable in 2010</a
          >. It was the first time I was actually worried about my competition.
        </p>
        <p>I never imagined that seven years later I would acquire them.</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/pagelime-backdrop.png"
            alt="A decorative backdrop used by the original PageLime website"
          />
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-happened%3F">
          What happened? <a class="direct-link" href="#what-happened%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          About three years ago, I noticed PageLime's support starting to slip.
          This was evidenced by users' feedback on Twitter and emails from new
          Surreal CMS users that were coming from PageLime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out, for whatever reason, PageLime's founders had moved on to
          other businesses and someone new had taken over support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, PageLime remained stagnant. Development stopped. The forum
          went offline. Then the blog was taken down. Sure, the website and
          service were still online, but they were just kinda there.
        </p>
        <h2 id="down-for-a-week">
          Down for a week <a class="direct-link" href="#down-for-a-week">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          On May 25, 2017, Twitter users began reporting that
          <a href="https://twitter.com/karenzadesign/status/869266717108834305"
            >PageLime was down</a
          >. Sure enough it was, and it stayed down until June 2 with no
          official response from support.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can only speculate as to what happened. I don't know why it took so
          long to get the service back online. It was upsetting to users, for
          sure, but it also upset me as a SaaS owner who takes pride in offering
          <a href="https://twitter.com/bgooonz/status/869614153828315136"
            >top notch support</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-acquisition">
          The acquisition <a class="direct-link" href="#the-acquisition">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          In early June, one of PageLime's co-founders contacted me about
          sunsetting the service. I outlined my vision for migrating users to
          Surreal CMS and we eventually came to an agreement for acquisition.
          (Details of the acquisition will remain private as part of the
          agreement.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last few weeks, I've worked diligently to create a tool that
          helps PageLime users migrate their account to Surreal CMS. My goal was
          to make the transition as seamless as possible for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting today, you can migrate your PageLime account to Surreal CMS
          in just a few seconds with the automated migration tool available on
          PageLime's website.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-shutdown">
          The shutdown <a class="direct-link" href="#the-shutdown">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>PageLime will officially shutdown on August 31, 2017.</p>
        <p>
          To be clear, I didn't acquire PageLime to shut it down — that was
          already going to happen. I acquired it to offer users a seamless
          transition from one service to another, and Surreal CMS is undoubtedly
          the most qualified alternative for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the migration is completely opt-in. Users can decide if
          they want to migrate their accounts to Surreal CMS or seek another
          service. Those who do migrate will receive two weeks free to make sure
          Surreal CMS is a good fit for their business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I encourage PageLime users to join the
          <a href="https://community.surrealcms.com/"
            >Surreal CMS community forum</a
          >. It's a great place to ask questions, meet fellow designers, and
          show the community what you've been working on.
        </p>
