        <h1>Is your product the reason your startup is failing?</h1>

        <p>
          The idea of launching a product, running your own business, and being
          your own boss is very appealing. Perhaps that's why so many people
          risk doing it. The problem is, many of them don't succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are hundreds of reasons a startup can fail, but let's focus on
          one for a minute: your product. Just because you think your product is
          great, doesn't mean the rest of the world does. Before jumping into
          anything too serious, ask yourself these questions to determine
          whether or not your product will fail before it even launches.
        </p>
        <h2 id="is-it-something-people-want%3F">
          Is it something people want?
          <a class="direct-link" href="#is-it-something-people-want%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Before you start building, you need to figure out if your product is
          viable. Is it something that you want to build, or is it something
          that people want to buy? It's easy to get excited over an idea only to
          realize later on that nobody actually has a need for what you're
          making.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how can you tell if a product is viable? It's not easy, but you can
          feel it out by asking potential customers what they think of your
          idea, if they'd use it, what they'd pay for it, etc. You'd be
          surprised at how honest most people will be with you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="has-it-been-done-before%3F">
          Has it been done before?
          <a class="direct-link" href="#has-it-been-done-before%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pick a problem and it's probably been solved already. At least, that's
          what it seems like these days. Seriously, you want a social network
          for your cat? You got it. How about an app that does nothing more than
          text your friends the word &quot;yo&quot;? Ditto.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you may not be completely out of luck. If you're trying to do
          something that's already been done, it may still be possible. You'll
          just have to work a bit harder at it and do it better. The most
          well-known example of this is probably Facebook. Everyone was using
          MySpace when Facebook came along and, against all odds, practically
          destroyed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not impossible to successfully do what's already been done, but
          you'll need to study your competition. Find their weak spots and beat
          them at their own game. Do what they're doing (or what they're not
          doing), but do it better. That's how a second-to-market product will
          have a shot at winning.
        </p>
        <h2 id="is-it-economical%3F">
          Is it economical?
          <a class="direct-link" href="#is-it-economical%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your product must be cost effective so you don't drown in the debt of
          producing or maintaining it, but it also needs to be cheap enough so
          your users can afford it. The only reason every other car on the road
          isn't a <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla</a> right now is
          because of their higher-than-average price. (Why do you think they're
          <a
            href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/07/16/a-35000-tesla-model-iii-is-coming-in-2017/"
            >trying so hard</a
          >
          to get the cost down?)
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't an easy task either, but overpricing your product can be
          detrimental to your startup. Again, ask your users what they're
          willing to pay and see if it aligns with what your costs are and what
          you're comfortable with the business making. How many people need to
          buy or subscribe to make it sustainable? Are those numbers even
          achievable?
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't forget to take into account operating costs, marketing budgets,
          employee salaries, and other expenses. They can add up fast and, if
          you're not careful, quickly run you into debt.
        </p>
        <h2 id="is-it-too-confusing%3F">
          Is it too confusing?
          <a class="direct-link" href="#is-it-too-confusing%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Maybe your product works well, but the average person can't figure out
          how to use it. That's not good in terms of revenue, because they
          probably won't become a paying customer. You could be losing your best
          customers because your product is too confusing to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, this is something you can fix. It may be as simple as
          throwing a getting started video up on your homepage or funneling
          users through a walkthrough after they sign up. As simple as you think
          it is—trust me—there are people who won't be able to figure it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that you're using and testing your own product all the
          time. You live and breathe it. You know everything it does and exactly
          how it works, but new users are seeing it for the very first time. If
          anything scares or confuses them, chances are you've lost their
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step back for a minute and purge your brain. Pretend you've never seen
          your product before. What might be confusing for new users? What could
          be made easier or more obvious? How could your product become more
          friendly and inviting? There's always room for improvement, so if you
          can't identify these things on your own, ask someone for their
          opinion. A fresh pair of eyes could be just what you need to improve
          your onboarding strategy.

          Is the timing right?

          <a
            href="https://pr.netflix.com/WebClient/loginPageSalesNetWorksAction.do?contentGroupId=10477"
            >Netflix was founded in 1997</a
          >
          and mailed its first DVD in 1999. Nowadays, pretty much everyone and
          their mother has a Netflix account, but I bet you're not checking your
          mailbox for DVDs anymore. That's because
          <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/technology/16netflix.html"
            >in 2007</a
          >, they started their transition into a streaming video service.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what would have happened if Netflix started out streaming videos
          back in the 90s? Would it have been as successful as it is today?
          Probably not. Back then, the average person was still using
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56_kbit/s_modem">a 56k modem</a
          >. Try streaming an HD video over a connection that takes 10 seconds
          to load Yahoo's homepage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Timing is everything, and that's something Netflix got right. They
          started by mailing out DVDs and, as Internet connections got faster,
          they pioneered a distribution method that wouldn't have been possible
          in earlier years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe your product has the same problem. Maybe it's ahead of its time,
          or maybe it would have been useful a few years ago. Either way, you
          have to make sure whatever you're producing is relevant to the here
          and now. Otherwise, you'll probably have a lot of trouble selling it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope these questions help you identify any weak points your product
          may have. This list obviously isn't comprehensive, so if you have
          anything to add I'd love to hear about it in the comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hate coming across as a pessimist, but the reality is that starting
          a business is hard. If it were easy, we'd all be millionaire CEOs by
          now. So let me leave you with something a bit more optimistic. Here's
          a quote by Drew Houston, the co-founder and CEO of Dropbox:
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Don't worry about failure. You only have to be right once.&quot;
