# An icon converter that supports multiple sizes and transparency

September 19, 2013 • 1 min read

If you're looking for an online utility to convert JPEG, PNG, or GIF images to ICO format, here's one that does exactly that. It supports full transparency when converting 24-bit PNGs and even lets you combine multiple resolutions into one icon file — perfect for generating favicons.

The name of the tool is [ICO Converter](http://www.icoconverter.com/) and, while the design of the page isn't very flashy, it works exceptionally well. Give it a try and start making some icons!
