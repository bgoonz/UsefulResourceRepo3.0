          I posted a tweet yesterday that was met with some controversy, so I
          thought it would be a good idea to unravel it.

          At face value, I understand why people are upset with this. It's hard
          to provide context in 280 characters, though, so
          <a href="https://twitter.com/bgooonz/status/1445479402532261892"
            >I made it a thread</a
          >. That was a mistake, because people don't always read the thread so
          the intent gets lost and assumptions get made. Twitter is a wonderful
          place.

        <h2 id="semantically-different">
          Semantically Different
          <a class="direct-link" href="#semantically-different">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let's start by stating the obvious. A button and a link are
          <a href="https://www.webaxe.org/proper-use-buttons-links/"
            >semantically different HTML elements</a
          >, so no need to bust out the keyboard to tell me that. The idea of
          merging the two into a single component comes from real world
          experience working on multiple design system teams for large
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact is that designers always, always ask for links that look like
          buttons and buttons that look like links. I know,
          <a
            href="https://twitter.com/oliverturner/status/1445724464860127244?s=20"
            >designers shouldn't do this</a
          >. But this isn't a fantasy, it's our reality, and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/bgooonz/status/1445722314889437184"
            >when it costs your organization measurable value</a
          >
          in terms of conversions, sales, etc., you're not going to win that
          argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotions aside, this often leads to developers producing two separate
          <a href="https://explore.fast.design/components/fast-button"
            >button</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://explore.fast.design/components/fast-anchor">link</a>
          components with the same styles and logic, and consumers end up
          misusing them just like <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and
          <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To alleviate this,
          <a href="https://twitter.com/bgooonz/status/1445480631832436747"
            >I propose that a custom element</a
          >
          such as <code>&lt;my-button&gt;</code> should render the same
          &quot;button&quot; visually, but based on the presense of an optional
          <code>href</code> attribute, it will use a
          <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> under the
          hood.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;my-button&gt;Save&lt;/my-button&gt;
&lt;!-- ðŸ‘‰ &lt;button class=&quot;button button--primary&quot;&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt; --&gt;

&lt;my-button href=&quot;/new&quot;&gt;New&lt;/my-button&gt;
&lt;!-- ðŸ‘‰ &lt;a class=&quot;button button--primary&quot; href=&quot;/new&quot;&gt;New&lt;/a&gt; --&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          This makes it more foolproof â€” if it goes somewhere, it becomes a
          link. If not, it's remains a button. So far, we're more or less
          aligned with the Twittersphereâ€¦<a
            href="https://twitter.com/EmmaJ_PR/status/1445664177821925387?s=20"
            >except for one detail</a
          >:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >They should look different because they should do different
            things.</em
          >
        </p>
        <h2 id="visually-different%3F">
          Visually Different?
          <a class="direct-link" href="#visually-different%3F">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          As much as I want to agree with this statement, it falls apart in
          practice.
          <em
            >Links will inevitably need to look like buttons from time to
            time.</em
          >
          No, buttons and links are not <em>semantically</em> the same, but
          there are times when they need to be <em>visually</em> the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          In web apps, the function of buttons and links is often blended. Some
          actions, such as &quot;new,&quot; might simply open a new page. Others
          aren't as obvious. &quot;Save&quot; might fire off an
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"
            >XHR</a
          >
          and redirect you to another page if the response is successful â€” or go
          nowhere and show an error if the response fails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, the line between &quot;button&quot; and &quot;link&quot; is
          more blurry. Should it still be a link if it takes me somewhere only
          <em>after</em> an XHR is successful? What if the request errors out
          and doesn't redirect? What if you click a link and the app prevents
          navigation because you have unsaved changes? There are so many
          scenarios and &quot;what ifs&quot; that, in practice, it's hard to
          settle on a 100% agreeable definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then comes the design team with a Figma for the app's toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/toolbar-with-buttons.png"
            alt="Button group with four actions: new, edit, settings, download"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll assume that &quot;New&quot; takes you to <code>/new</code> and
          &quot;Edit&quot; takes you to <code>/edit/:id</code>. Those should
          definitely be links! But wait â€” &quot;Settings&quot; doesn't go
          anywhere. It just opens up a dialog, so it needs to be a button. And
          instead of creating an endpoint on the server that downloads the file,
          we'll use the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-download"
            ><code>download</code></a
          >
          attribute so that also needs to be a link.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's adjust the design to account for the idea that buttons and links
          <em>must</em> be visually different.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/toolbar-with-buttons-and-links.png"
            alt="A button group with a new link, edit link, settings button, and a download link"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you think the design team is going to be thrilled with these
          changes to the toolbar? Do you think your customers will prefer this
          toolbar over the previous one?
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-users-expect">
          What Users Expect
          <a class="direct-link" href="#what-users-expect">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          If the user is presented with a set of actions,
          <em>they don't care if you use buttons or links under the hood</em>.
          They care that it's consistent and that each control does what it's
          supposed to do. Remember that in all cases, each control's action is
          clearly inferred from its label.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether clicking &quot;Delete&quot; takes the user to a new page to
          confirm or opens a dialog to confirm is irrelevant. To the user,
          they're all just &quot;buttons&quot; that do something.*
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true that links and buttons have different behaviors and the
          decision to make them look visually similar should be carefully
          considered. For example, <kbd>CMD</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + click
          typically opens a link in a new window. When buttons and links are
          identical, it can put users at a disadvantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would recommend <em>not</em> making buttons and links look the same
          if you can reasonably expect the user will desire such behaviors. Some
          environments are more predictable than others. But accessibility isn't
          binary, so thought and consideration is still required from both
          design and development regardless of your approach.
        </p>
        <h2 id="enforcement-via-api">
          Enforcement via API
          <a class="direct-link" href="#enforcement-via-api">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The suggestion I'm making enforces the semantic definition of
          &quot;button&quot; and &quot;link&quot; by leaning on API design to
          ensure <abbr title="Don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> principles and
          remove the burden of thought from consumers. This solves the problem
          of when to use a link or button under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          It does not answer the question of &quot;<em
            >should buttons and links be visually similar</em
          >?&quot; That's a topic I'd love to have a conversation about because
          there are plenty of use cases that suggest at least sometimes they
          should.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just know that, if you're working on a design system, it's extremely
          likely you will come across this requirement!

            *This doesn't mean you should throw the baby out with the bathwater.
            It just means there might be situations where you need to use a link
            as a button, and the user doesn't care as long as it works. The
            download example comes do mind.
