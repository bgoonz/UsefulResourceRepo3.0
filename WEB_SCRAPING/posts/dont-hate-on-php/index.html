          It wasn't long after launching a major open source PHP project until I
          started hearing things like
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12183268">this</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I [...] immediately drop interest in a project when I see that it is
            implemented in PHP.

          language you want for whatever reasons you want. I could honestly care
          less.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let me stop you from generalizing that opinion and shoving it down
          everyone's throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/captain-ssh.gif"
            alt='The captain shakes his head "no" and goes "shh"'
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, there are plenty of things I would change about PHP if I were
          the one designing it. I could say the same thing about every
          single programming language in the world, but that's not my job. I'm
          not engineering programming languages, I'm building web applications
          with them. And I'm certainly not going to undermine the hard working
          people who <em>are</em> designing these languages, whether I prefer to
          use them or not.
        </p>
        <h2 id="it's-just-a-tool">
          It's just a tool <a class="direct-link" href="#it's-just-a-tool">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          What developers seem to forget is that programming languages are
          nothing more than tools that help you get something done. Just like
          the tools in your garage, each and every one has a special purpose.
          Not every tool will work well for every job, and some tools do the
          same exact thing in very different ways. Variety is the spice of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nobody tells a roofer his hammer is shit. Nobody tells a plumber
          his pipe cutter sucks. Nobody tells a carpenter his level is garbage.
          Each craftsman has their own preference based on their own experience,
          and that's perfectly acceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="../../images/hammer-oh.gif"
            alt="A lady hits the wall with a hammer and acts surprised when a hole appears"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't like a tool, put it back in the toolbox. It's that
          simple. Don't run around telling everyone how shitty a programming
          language is because you don't like it. It might be your opinion,
          but it's a subjective, arrogant, and disrespectful opinion. Instead of
          coming off as a conceited asshole, use your expertise to advise people
          why a <em>specific tool</em> might be better for a
          <em>specific purpose</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you're right with your reason, it won't matter if you're wrong
          with your approach. We're supposed to be professionals — what say we
          start acting like it? Who knows what tomorrow will bring. For now,
          let's stop fussing over the tools we're using and focus on the goals
          we're trying to accomplish.
