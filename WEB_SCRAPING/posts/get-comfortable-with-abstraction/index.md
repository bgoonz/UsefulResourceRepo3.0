Get comfortable with abstraction
================================

February 18, 2015 • 1 min read

I stumbled across [a tweet](https://twitter.com/ossia/status/565907210497040384/photo/1) the other day and it's been resonating in my mind ever since. Mostly because it's something I tend to have a problem with.

You see, I have this thing where I try really hard to understand exactly how something works—all the way down to the last nut and bolt. Deep down I know that those details are usually irrelevant. But it bothers me to know there are things that I don't know.

I have a problem with abstraction.

So I'm posting this comic as a reminder for myself to look beyond the details and focus on the big picture. Maybe you'll enjoy reading it too.
