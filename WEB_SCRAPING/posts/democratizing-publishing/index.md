Democratizing publishing
========================

March 28, 2016 • 1 min read

One of the objectives Matt Mullenweg has for WordPress is to [democratize publishing](http://www.inc.com/glenn-leibowitz/meet-the-ceo-running-a-billion-dollar-company-with-no-offices-or-email.html), which is excellent. But the very same article states another objective is to "capture the 75 percent of the internet that WordPress doesn't already manage."

In my opinion, these goals conflict with each other. If Matt truly wanted to democratize publishing, he wouldn't be trying to monopolize it. That's how you destroy a democracy, not create one.

Of course, WordPress will never truly have 100% of the Internet, but the thought of closing in on that goal is very frightening. I've been a developer long enough to remember all too well how [Internet Explorer 6 stifled innovation for many years](http://mashable.com/2009/07/16/ie6-must-die/).

The same will happen as WordPress closes in on their goal, and that's exactly why we need more open source options like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Some words of wisdom from Nancy Pearcey:

> Competition is always a good thing. It forces us to do our best. A monopoly renders people complacent and satisfied with mediocrity.

Now, go forth and create!
