# Give your JPEGs alpha channels

August 07, 2014 • 1 min read

If you need alpha transparency on the web, 24-bit PNGs are usually your best bet. The only problem is that PNGs are lossless and can grow in file size very quickly — much larger than your average JPEG. So what if there was a way for JPEGs to support alpha channels?

I discovered this trick on [eleqtriq](http://w3.eleqtriq.com/2014/08/applying-alpha-channels-to-jpgs/). The author demonstrates how you can embed a JPEG into an SVG and, with the clever use of a mask, simulate a JPEG with alpha transparency. Since [browser support for SVG](http://caniuse.com/svg) is pretty good, there's nothing stopping you from using this method right now.

Cool trick, right? Check out [Dirk Weber's blog](http://w3.eleqtriq.com/2014/08/applying-alpha-channels-to-jpgs/) to see exactly how it's done.
