# JSON Feed

May 23, 2017 • 1 min read

[JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/) is a lot like RSS, except instead of XML it's formatted with JSON. It's a rather new spec, [introduced just last week](https://jsonfeed.org/2017/05/17/announcing_json_feed), but it's been getting some [major coverage](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/18/maxime-vaillancourt-json-feed-viewer) and a number of applications have already started supporting it.

Since Postleaf was built for the modern publisher, I decided to add support for it in alpha 5. It's just like [John Gruber says](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/23/json-feed-dr-drang), "easier to generate, easier to parse."

I expect to see a lot about JSON Feed in the coming months. I'm even happier to report that, within days of the spec being released, Postleaf is well-prepared!
