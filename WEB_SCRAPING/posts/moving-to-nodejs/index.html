        <h1>Moving to Node.js</h1>

        <div class="post-date">
          <time datetime="2017-02-06"> February 06, 2017 </time>

        <p>
          The first version of Postleaf was written in PHP and lives on as
          Leafpub. It's a beautiful piece of software that I'm very proud of,
          but I decided to move the project to Node.js for a few important
          reasons. This is by no means a knock on PHP, which will always have a
          special place in my heart, but more of a changing with the times
          realization.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've ever worked with Node.js before, you'll know that it's fast.
          <em>Very fast.</em> The beauty of Node is that it's minimal by design.
          It can do anything you want it to do with the right packages, and this
          concept aligns very closely with my vision for Postleaf.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've probably been hearing <em>JavaScript is the Future</em> a lot
          lately. I think there's a lot of truth to that statement, especially
          as platforms such as
          <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> and
          <a href="https://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> gain popularity and bring
          JavaScript to places it's never been before.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to write the same
          app three different times in three different languages for three
          different platforms (think iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps, for
          example). We've been doing it for years, but I foresee JavaScript
          playing a vital role in closing that gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          By moving Postleaf to Node.js, its foundation is becoming much more
          nimble, making it easier to pivot and adapt to an ever-changing
          technology ecosystem. That, unfortunately, is something I don't think
          PHP will be able to do.
        </p>
