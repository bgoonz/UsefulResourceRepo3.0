Heads up! This post was written in 2008, so it may contain information that is no longer accurate. I keep posts like this around for historical purposes and to prevent link rot, so please keep this in mind as you're reading.

Today has been an exciting day. I received documentation from the State of Florida stating that A Beautiful Site, LLC. is officially a limited liability company. This marks the new beginning of a period of growth for ABS, which has been, until now, a sole proprietorship.

In the next few weeks, [Surreal CMS](http://www.surrealcms.com/) will be officially released to the public. This is the first of a number of services that ABS will offer, with hopes of making many lives easier through creative, effective, and intuitive Web-based applications.

To all of our clients, readers, and friends: Thank you for all of your support over the last year and a half. Without your patronage, insight, and encouragement, A Beautiful Site would not be where it is today. I look forward to working with all of you for many years to come.
