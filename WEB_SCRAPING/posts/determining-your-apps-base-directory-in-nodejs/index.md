Determining your app's base directoryÂ in Node.js
================================================

February 09, 2017 â€¢ 1 min read

Determining your app's base dir (or *document root* if you're from a PHP background) isn't as straight forward as you'd think in Node. Here's a little trick to get a globally available reference to your app's root directory.

Add this somewhere towards the start of your main app file (e.g. `app.js`):

    global.__basedir = __dirname;

This sets a global variable that will always be equivalent to your app's base dir. Use it just like any other variable:

    const yourModule = require(__basedir + '/path/to/module.js');

I know what you're thinking: oh noÂ a global! ðŸ˜«

And I would normally agree, but I thinkÂ thisÂ technique is a fair exception if you're developing an app. Here's why:

-   There [really isn't](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18721515/567486) a consistent way to references the base dir without it.
-   It's a fair requirement to set if you're worried about reusing modules.
-   It's a lot easier and more stable than using `../../../file.js`Â all the time.
-   It shares the same naming convention as `__dirname` and `__filename`.

There are, of course, other techniques that may or may not be more appropriate depending on your app. However, in my opinion, this approachÂ is the most elegant.
