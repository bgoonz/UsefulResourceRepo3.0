      <p>
        A Beautiful Site was founded in 2007 by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/claviska">Cory LaViska</a>, a full-stack
        software engineer and UX architect with nearly 20 years of experience.
        You may know Cory from his work on
        <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace.style</a>,
        <a href="https://www.surrealcms.com/">Surreal CMS</a>, or
        <a href="https://github.com/claviska">his open source work</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cory holds a Master's degree in Information Technology and a Bachelor's
        in Computer Information Systems, both from
        <a href="https://fit.edu/">Florida Tech</a>. His experience creating,
        maintaining, marketing, and supporting a SaaS product for over 10 years
        speaks to his capablities as a product owner and business manager. He's
        also a veteran of the <a href="https://www.goarmy.com/">U.S. Army</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open source software is something Cory has been passionate about for a
        long time. His most notable project is
        <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace.style</a>, a library of web
        components that boasts millions of monthly CDN downloads and a vibrant
        community of users. Much of his spare time is dedicated to building and
        maintaining open source software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cory is currently a senior software engineer at Microsoft building great
        things with web components. In prior roles, he led the charge to
        establish and deliver a framework-agnostic design system for a $300M
        organization; he has been the lead engineer in a university-wide website
        redesign; he digitized an in-person orientation system for a university
        that saved an estimated $42K per year; he built a production tracking
        app that powers a complex manufacturing process for machine shops; and
        he has served as a consultant for numerous organzations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cory describes himself as a developer with an eye for design. His
        philosophy is that software should be simple. In fact, he is an enemy of
        complexity and over-engineering and believes that software should be
        smarter and conform to <em>our</em> needs, not the other way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a New Hampshire native, Cory spent many years living under the
        Florida sun. He now resides back home in New Hampshire.
      </p>

        and incorporates a touch of Brutalism. The website is generated with
